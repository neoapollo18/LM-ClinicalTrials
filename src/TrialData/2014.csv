Emory University,NCT02465463,Early FMT for C.Difficile,Emory University,1,1,Clostridium Difficile,Procedure,Fecal microbiota transplant (FMT),Treatment,,"Clostridium difficile infection ( CDI ) has increased worldwide in both frequency and severity . It is the leading cause of hospital acquired infection in developed countries and has been associated with at least 14,000 deaths per year in the United States . With 3 million cases/ year , the annual cost for treating the infection is exceeding 3 billion dollars . It can also have a profound negative impact on quality of life . The investigators believe that patients who are at high risk of relapse after a first CDI episode would benefit from early fecal microbial transplant ( FMT ) . The proposed study will produce preliminary data regarding safety and efficacy and potential for cost effectiveness for the use of early fecal transplant in those patients with their first episode of non-refractory CDI who are predicted to have a high rate of recurrence based on previously published risk factors . The investigators will be better prepared to test the efficacy of this approach in a future multicenter clinical trial in a randomized controlled fashion . The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness and safety of early fecal transplant using donor stool from a healthy person in a group of patients who are diagnosed with their first episode of Clostridium difficile infection and are predicted to have a high chance of the infection returning against a similar group of patients who receive current standard of care for treatment of C.difficile . The investigators hypothesize : that clinical remission rates at 12 weeks as noted by absence of clinical symptoms and/or negative C.difficile stool polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) will be greater in the experimental arm compared to the control arm that patients in the experimental group will have a low microbial diversity prior to FMT but will exhibit a high microbial diversity after the FMT that resembles the respective donor that the microbial diversity will be diminished in both groups at the time of enrollment , but the experimental group will exhibit a higher microbial diversity compared to the control population at 12 weeks that patients in both groups will exhibit poor quality of life at the time of enrollment , however , the experimental group will demonstrate higher quality of life compared to the control group at follow up after completion of treatment that costs incurred by the experimental group will be less than the control group","Treatment of CDI remains challenging , especially in those with recurrent disease . Failures rates of 20-30 % with initial treatment have been reported , and up to 65 % fail after a third course of antibiotics . In addition , costs of treatment , which can be upward of $ 3000 for a 10 day course of a single antibiotic , may leave many patients and their families financially overburdened . Use of FMT has shown to be effective with cure rates above 80 % , safe even in immunocompromised patients , and cost effective in those with recurrent ( 3 or more ) episodes of C.difficile . Emory University and Emory Clinic have performed over 100 FMT 's since July 2012 for treatment of recurrent or refractory CDI and has had similar cure rates . Current treatment approaches for CDI limit the use of fecal transplant to those who have had more than 2 recurrences with at least one failure of a 6-8 week taper with vancomycin or at least 2 episodes of severe CDI resulting in hospitalization or refractory CDI defined as moderate CDI not responding to standard therapy for at least one week ( 5 ) . However , the investigators feel that by attempting to perform FMT early after a first episode in those at high risk of recurrence , decreased recurrence rates , improved quality of life , and lower health care costs will be seen . Patients who participate will be randomized to one of two groups - one group who receives a fecal transplant and another group who will not receive a fecal transplant . A fecal transplant using a sigmoidoscopy will occur after the subjects in the fecal transplant arm complete the course of antibiotics for treatment of the C.difficile infection . Healthy stool from a donor will be infused into the colon to help replenish good bacteria that patients with C.difficile infection often do not have . The group that does not undergo FMT will take antibiotics and probiotic therapy for management of CDI as part of standard of care .",2014-11-27,"January 5, 2018","Inclusion Criteria : Patients must meet all of the following criteria to be eligible for the study : First or second episode of CDI responding to therapy Must have 2 or more of the following criteria : Age > 65 Severe underlying disease ( measured by Horn index score of 3 or 4 ) Additional non-C.difficile antibiotic exposure during CDI episode Use of antacids Previous episode of CDI Willingness to accept a fecal product made using unrelated donor stool and to comply with study protocol requirements Able to give informed consent Chronic infection with HIV , HBV , HCV is permitted unless the viral infection compromises the ability of the patient to safely participate in the study .

"National Institute for Medical Research, Tanzania",NCT02533336,The Effectiveness of Non-Pyrethroid Insecticide-Treated Durable Wall Liners as a Method for Malaria Control in Endemic Rural Tanzania,"National Institute for Medical Research, Tanzania",3,0,Malaria,Drug,abamectin and fenpyroximate,Prevention,,"Over one year period in an area with universal coverage of LLIN and ACT provision as the first-line treatment of malaria , the investigators intend to evaluate the impact of DL on malaria transmission as measured by the incidence of malaria parasitemia , the prevalence of moderate to severe anemia , and entomological parameters . Information on the relative cost-effectiveness estimates of DL and the community acceptability of DL will also be measured .","Vector control , together with prompt treatment with an artemisinin-based combination therapy ( ACT ) for individuals diagnosed with malaria and intermittent preventive treatment in pregnant women , is a critical component of malaria control in Africa . The two main vector control interventions used in Africa are long-lasting insecticidal nets ( LLINs ) and indoor residual spraying ( IRS ) . LLINs are currently the mainstay of vector control and are believed to have contributed to the recent dramatic decline in malaria cases . However , resistance to the pyrethroid insecticides used in the bed nets has increased . The second main vector control method , IRS , has been an extremely effective adjunct to LLINs ; its usefulness is threatened by the high cost of repeated applications and increasing mosquito resistance to insecticides used for spraying . A new product , durable lining ( DL ) treated with non-pyrethroid insecticides , has been developed by Vestergaard , which theoretically mimics the effect of IRS but is designed to last for a minimum of three years . The product consists of a mixture of two non-pyrethroid insecticides incorporated into a polymer fabric that are designed to migrate differentially over the lifetime of the product to ensure sustained bioefficacy . The use of two agents may also decrease the risk of development of resistance . It is estimated that the cost of the insecticide treated wall liners ( DL ) , which are installed on the indoor walls of houses , would be equal to 2-3 rounds of IRS . To test the effectiveness of this new product , we will conduct a two-arm controlled randomized cluster trial to test the hypothesis that DL + LLINs are superior to LLINs alone . Over twelve ( 12 ) months ( August 2015- Aug 2016 ) , in an area with universal coverage ( UC ) of LLINs and where artemisinin combination therapies ( ACT ) are provided as the first-line treatment of malaria , we intend to evaluate the impact of DL on malaria transmission among children ages 6 months to 11 years as measured by the incidence of malaria parasitemia ( symptomatic and asymptomatic ) , and the prevalence of moderate to severe anemia in under-fives . In addition , we will assess the effect of DL on entomological parameters , and measure the acceptability and a cost-effectiveness of the intervention . Stratified randomization based on malaria prevalence during the baseline survey will be used to select 22 clusters per arm in Muheza district .",2014-07-13,"February 4, 2019","Inclusion criteria : Permanent residence in a selected household Aged 6 months- 11years for cohort study Informed parental consent For children between 8-11 years old , written assent Exclusion criteria : Severely ill and unlikely to be able to complete the study Family does not intend to remain in the study area during the study period , or through the long rains Household does not accept intervention Not living in the study area when interventions were implemented enrolled in other interventional study",4917,0,6 Months,11 Years

The purpose of this study is to examine the utility of fluoxetine for the treatment of this debilitating disorder . Fluoxetine is expected to improve social anxiety and selective mutism symptomology .","Children with selective mutism ( SM ) are at risk for current and continuing academic and socio-emotional difficulties . Unfortunately , this issue is complicated by the fact these children often respond poorly to psychosocial intervention . This leaves parents with the overwhelming decision to attempt a trial of medication regardless of the little available data on the evidence base of this approach . Despite the paucity of research , psychiatrists are prescribing fluoxetine for children with SM `` off label '' , as the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) has yet to approve fluoxetine for this indication . This study blends the psychopharmacological expertise of psychiatrists with the mental health , systems , and psychological evaluation expertise of school psychologists to identify an appropriate psychopharmacological solution for children and adolescents with this debilitating disorder . To that end , this study will examine the utility of fluoxetine for the treatment of five children and adolescents , ages seven to eighteen , diagnosed with SM through the use of a non-concurrent multiple-baseline single-case design with a single-blind placebo-controlled procedure . Treatment effectiveness will be evaluated by visual analysis of the data , the Wampold and Worsham multiple-baseline design randomization test , and the Kendall 's Tau + Mann-Whitney U effect size . Multiple methods of assessment including standardized measures , such as the Selective Mutism Questionnaire ( SMQ ) , and behavior ratings , such as Direct Behavior Ratings ( DBRs ) , will be used to gather baseline and treatment data . Multiple informants ( i.e. , parents , teachers , and psychiatrists ) will provide information on treatment effect across settings ( i.e. , school and community ) . Information regarding adverse effects associated with fluoxetine treatment including a measure of behavioral disinhibition , parental acceptance of the fluoxetine intervention , and compliance with taking the medication will also be gathered .",2014-05-19,"May 17, 2022","Inclusion Criteria : Male or female from seven to seventeen years of age at their last birthday Meet DSM-IV-TR criteria for selective mutism No history of medication treatment for selective mutism Child has an immediate biological family member who is diagnosed with an anxiety disorder or has experienced symptoms of an anxiety disorder at some point in time Child has received 10 weeks of an evidence-based psychosocial treatment Child has never had a negative reaction to a psychopharmacological medication Child exhibits symptoms of social anxiety Exclusion Criteria : Child is diagnosed with a speech condition , mental retardation , pervasive developmental disorder , or schizophrenia Child is an English language learner or from a different culture than the culture predominately represented within his or her school Child is taking or has taken any kind of a psychopharmacological medication ( e.g. , SSRI , MAO-I , stimulant , etc . ) Child has a medical illness that may be complicated through the use of a psychopharmacological treatment",6,0,5 Years,18 Years
VU University of Amsterdam,NCT02501798,The Effects of Long-acting Methylphenidate on Academic Activity and Related Constructs in Children With ADHD,VU University of Amsterdam,4,1,Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder,Drug,Methylphenidate,Treatment,Quadruple,"This study aims at investigating the direct effects of methylphenidate on school performance of primary school children . Although behavioral effects of this frequently prescribed drug are thoroughly studied ( and confirmed ) , the effects of methylphenidate on school performance are less clear . Recent overviews indicate that effects are mainly quantitative and subject-specific . To gain more insight in this issue , the current double blind placebo controlled crossover study investigates not only the effects of methylphenidate on school performance but also it 's effect on related variables such as short term memory , motivation and behavior . 60 children with ADHD are included and tested twice ( with medication and with placebo ) at their primary school .","Rationale : ADHD ( attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ) is a common childhood developmental disorder . Besides the behavioural symptoms of ADHD , many children with ADHD experience problems with academic activities . More specifically , these children show problems with math , spelling and reading . The most common treatment for ADHD is medical treatment with methylphenidate ( MPH ) . This treatment is effective in the reduction of ADHD symptoms . However , it is unclear whether treatment with MPH can also improve academic activity . If MPH improves academic activity , it is of great interest to understand which variables influence or mediate this effect . The results from this study can give more insight in the working mechanisms and effectiveness of MPH in reducing the academic problems commonly observed in children with ADHD . Objectives : The main objective of this study is to assess the impact of MPH on academic activity and to estimate the role of three putative mediators in this relation . Study design and population : This study is a randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled cross-over design with a patient group and a control group . Main study parameters/endpoints : The main study parameters are changes in academic activity ( ability , effort and engagement ) . In addition , changes in putative mediators are assessed .",2014-04-09,"May 12, 2016","Inclusion Criteria : ADHD diagnosis ( DSM-IV ) primary school education sufficient knowledge of Dutch language Exclusion Criteria : neurological or psychiatric disorder other than ODD , CD , learning disorder , dyslexia , anxiety disorder Healthy volunteers are accepted for the control group",61,0,8 Years,12 Years

Week 48 ...","The purpose of this study is to assess the safety/tolerability and efficacy of using ustekinumab in subjects with common variable immunodeficiency CVID or selective IgG subclass deficiency ( functional agammaglobulinemia ) who have associated symptomatic gastrointestinal inflammation ( CVID enteropathy ) . Ustekinumab ( a Food and Drug Administration [ FDA ] approved drug ) is a monoclonal antibody to interleukin ( IL ) -12/23p40 . CVID is a clinically heterogeneous disorder characterized by decreased serum immunoglobulin IgG and IgA levels . In addition to chronic or recurrent pyogenic sino-pulmonary infections , many patients develop non-infectious gastrointestinal manifestations that can be disabling or fatal . Currently there is no standard therapy for the associated gastrointestinal disease outside of empiric nutritional intervention for weight loss , anti-diarrheal agents , and non-specific anti-inflammatory agents . Recently , gut inflammation complicating functional hypogammaglobulinemia due to CVID and selective IgG subclass deficiency has been characterized as a T helper type 1 ( Th1 ) inflammatory response , with excess IL-12 cytokine production associated with diarrhea and weight loss as well as reduced D-xylose absorption and steatorrhea . This protocol aims to test specific anti-IL-12 therapy in this patient group . It has been previously shown that therapy targeted to IL-12 successfully treated the Th1 gut inflammation of Crohn s disease ( CD ) . Ustekinumab , a monoclonal antibody to the p40 subunit of IL-12 and IL-23 , is FDA approved for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis , active psoriatic arthritis , and more recently , moderately to severely active CD . This protocol is designed to measure the safety of ustekinumab in patients with functional hypogammaglobulinemia and CVID enteropathy , as well as measure effects on symptoms , gut function , expression of immune cell surface markers , production of cytokines and global gene expression from blood and gut mucosal mononuclear cells , and the gut microbiota . Patients with CVID and selective IgG subclass deficiency with gastrointestinal symptoms of malabsorption , maldigestion , and chronic diarrhea will be enrolled into this study . Subjects ( up to a total of 10 individuals ) will receive a treatment dose of 270 mg ( 3 doses of 90 mg either single-use prefilled syringe or single-use vial , depending on availability ) will be injected subcutaneously in subjects by qualified nursing staff on the Day 0 study visit . Subjects will then receive a follow up treatment dose of 90 mg at Week 8 , Week 16 , Week 24 , Week 32 and Week 40 and be followed for a total of 48 weeks . Subjects will have study procedures prior to treatment and 48 weeks post-treatment , these include upper and/or lower endoscopies , to measure changes in immune responses and studies to evaluate physiologic measures of gut function at 48 weeks , as well as routine safety monitoring throughout the study . Gut absorption tests will be performed at the Week 24 visit . Variables will include safety ( adverse event rate ) , clinical ( weight , stool frequency , results of gut absorption tests ) , and laboratory ( lymphocyte and cytokine assays ) parameters for descriptive summary statistical analysis ( n , mean , median , standard deviation , minimum and maximum range ) .",2014-07-23,"August 10, 2020","DIAGNOSIS AND CRITERIA FOR INCLUSION : A subject is eligible for the study if all of the following criteria are met : Has given written informed consent .

However , its relatively low efficacy prevents its application to the treatment of actinic cheilitis ( AC ) . Er : YAG ablative fractional laser ( AFL ) treatment removes the stratum corneum to increase MAL uptake and may improve efficacy . However , no studies have directly compared the efficacy of MAL-PDT with and without Er : YAG AFL in treating AC","Actinic cheilitis ( AC ) is a keratinocytic neoplasm of the lip , especially the lower lip , is confined to the epidermis , and results from chronic or excessive ultraviolet exposure . AC is an early manifestation of lip squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) , and SCC of the lip is usually associated with an identifiable pre-existent AC . Furthermore , the likelihood that AC will progress to SCC is higher than actinic keratosis ( AK ) . Consequently , early identification and treatment of AC is recommended . PDT involves the activation of a photosensitizer by irradiation with 400- to 700-nm light to create cytotoxic oxygen and free radicals that kill dysplastic cells . Methyl aminolaevulinate photodynamic therapy ( MAL-PDT ) is advantageous in that it has few cosmetic side effects and minimises patient discomfort . However , its relatively low efficacy prevents its application to the treatment of actinic cheilitis ( AC ) . Erbium : yttrium-aluminium-garnet ( Er : YAG ) ablative fractional laser ( AFL ) therapy has been used frequently to improve treatment efficacy of PDT . Er : YAG AFL can ablate stratum corneum with minimal penetration depth and producing minimal thermal injury . This approach creates microscopic vertical holes in the ablated tissue , surrounded by thin layers of coagulated tissue . Er : YAG AFL does not injure the entire thickness of the epidermis ; therefore , healing times are minimised .

Inhibiting the Hsp90 chaperone complex results in the recruitment of ubiquitin ligases , polyubiquination , and proteosomal degradation of Hsp90 client proteins , including transcription factors and proteins involved in angiogenesis vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , vascular endothelial growth factor receptor ( VEGFR ) , hypoxia-inducible factor 1 ( HIF-1 ) , signal transducers and activators of transcription protein 3 ( STAT-3 ) ; growth factor independence rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma ( RAF ) , epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) , human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( Her2 ) , insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor ( IGFR ) ; resistance to anti-growth signals cyclin-dependent kinase 4 ( CDK4 ) ; tissue invasion and metastases mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor ( MET ) , matrix metalloproteinase-2 ( MMP2 ) ; and avoidance of apoptosis protein kinase B ( AKT ) , rat insulin promoter ( RIP ) , Survivin , B cell lymphoma ( Bcl-2 ) . HIF-1-alpha activation has been implicated in mediating resistance to anti-angiogenic therapy ; recent evidence implicates a greater role for Hsp90 in direct modulation of VEGF signaling . Combining Hsp90 inhibition with ganetespib and anti-angiogenic therapy with Ziv-Aflibercept , a soluble fusion protein with high binding affinity for vascular endothelial growth factor A ( VEGF-A ) , vascular endothelial growth factor B ( VEGF-B ) , and placenta growth factor ( PIGF ) , presents a rational novel strategy for improving upon and overcoming resistance to anti-angiogenic therapy PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : - To establish the safety , tolerability , and maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) of the combination of ganetespib and Ziv-Aflibercept in patients with refractory gastrointestinal carcinomas , non-squamous non-small cell lung carcinomas , urothelial carcinomas , and sarcomas SECONDARY OBJECTIVE : To assess modulation of HIF-1-alpha as a pharmacodynamic marker of therapy with the combination of ganetespib and Ziv-Aflibercept To assess modulation of epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) expression using 89Zr-labeled , EGFR-targeting antibody panitumumab positron emission tomography ( PET ) /computed tomography ( CT ) imaging of tumor lesions prior to and following treatment with study drugs ELIGIBILITY : Adult patients with histologically confirmed metastatic gastrointestinal carcinomas , non-squamous non-small cell lung carcinomas , urothelial carcinomas , and sarcomas with disease progression after at least one line of standard therapy Participants in the expansion phase must demonstrate EGFR expression on archival tumor samples and have disease amenable to biopsy with willingness to undergo pre- and post-treatment biopsies No major surgery within 4 weeks prior to study enrollment , no radiation or chemotherapy within 3 weeks prior to enrollment ; patients must have recovered from toxicities of prior therapies to at least eligibility levels prior to enrollment . STUDY DESIGN : Ganetespib will be administered intravenously weekly on days 1 , 8 , and 15 of a 28-day cycle . Ziv-Aflibercept will be administered intravenously every 2 weeks , on days 1 and 15 , during a 28-day cycle . The escalation portion of the trial will follow a standard 3+3 design , whereby patients are dose-escalated in cohorts of 3 until dose-limiting toxicity is observed . Once the MTD is established , 10 additional patients will be enrolled to the expansion phase , at the MTD , and tumor biopsies will be obtained to assess pharmacodynamic endpoints . During cycle 1 of the expansion phase , ganetespib will be administered intravenously weekly , on days 8 and 15 with omission of day 1 treatment to accommodate a baseline biopsy pre-ganetespib but after administration of Ziv-Aflibercept . For all subsequent cycles , ganetespib will be administered days 1 , 8 , and 15 . Ziv-Aflibercept will still be administered intravenously every 2 weeks , on days 1 and 15 , of a 28-day cycle . PET/CT imaging with 89Zr-labeled panitumumab will be performed to evaluate tumor distribution prior to and following treatment with study agents .",2014-07-15,"March 2, 2018","INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients must have histologically confirmed recurrent or metastatic gastrointestinal carcinomas , non-squamous non-small cell lung carcinomas , urothelial carcinomas , and sarcomas with disease progression after at least one line of standard therapy .

Vivoryon Therapeutics N.V.,NCT02190708,Effects of PQ912 on the Pharmacokinetics of Midazolam and Omeprazole,Vivoryon Therapeutics N.V.,1,1,Healthy Volunteers,Drug,PQ912,Basic Science,,"Midazolam is a rapid-acting benzodiazepine , with a short half-life ( approximately 1.9 hours ) and is primarily metabolised by CYP3A . Omeprazole is a selective proton pump inhibitor substrate used to reduce gastric acid secretion . Omeprazole is primarily metabolised by CYP2C19 . Midazolam and omeprazole are both used as probe drugs in clinical pharmacology studies to evaluate clinical CYP3A and CYP2C19 drug interactions , respectively . Furthermore the EMA and the FDA guidance on drug interactions recommend the use of these drugs for such evaluations . The aim of this study is to assess the effect of PQ912 on the PK of midazolam and omeprazole . In vitro studies have demonstrated that PQ912 inhibits several CYP enzymes , including CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 and at the expected exposure levels in patients , has the potential to inhibit these enzymes in-vivo . This study is therefore planned to investigate the potential changes in the PK of midazolam and omeprazole due to the effect of PQ912 at steady-state . In clinical practice it is likely that co-administration of PQ912 with other drugs that are metabolised via the CYP3A and/or CYP2C19 enzymes will occur .

Even diagnosed at early stage , long-term prognosis remains poor due to the high rate of recurrence after local treatments . Liver transplantation the only long-term curative treatment is limited by advanced age , comorbidities or the shortage of the graft It concerns less than 5 % of HCC patients . Therefore , the best approach to reduce mortality remains the reduction of HCC incidence .

Independently of its ' anti diabetic effects , Metformin is credited of anti tumoral , anti oxidant , anti inflammatory , and anti angiogenic properties . Amount epidemiological and experimental data have demonstrated the anti tumoral and chemopreventive effect of metformin in certain cancers . From our cohort of patients with compensated HCV cirrhosis and not treated by insulin , we have observed that the level of IR assessed by the HOMA was a strong and independent risk factor of HCC occurrence and liver related death . We have also observed in our cohort of diabetic patients with compensated HCV cirrhosis , that treatment by Metformin was associated with a decreased risk of HCC occurrence and liver related death . HYPOTHESIS Treatment with metformin could decreased the HCC occurrence and liver related death or transplantation . MAIN OBJECTIVE Evaluation the impact of Metformin treatment on HCC occurrence and liver related death in patients with compensated HCV cirrhosis and Insulinoresistance SECONDARY OBJECTIVE Occurrence of decompensation of the cirrhosis ( ascite , sepsis , encephalopathy , haemorrhage ) Evaluation of the treatment tolerance MAIN CRITERION JUDGMENT Rate of HCC occurrence or liver related-death or transplantation . SECONDARY CRITERION JUDGMENT Occurrence of decompensation of the cirrhosis ( ascite , sepsis , encephalopathy , haemorrhage ) , Tolerance STUDY ASSESSMENTS The patient of CIRVIR cohort meeting the inclusion criteria will be invited to participate to this study . During their next visit , the hepatologist , will give full verbal and written information regarding the objective procedures of the study and the possible benefice and side effects of the treatment . A write informed consent will be obtained from all patients who agree to participate to the study . The treatment period will begin following randomization . On day M0 baseline measurements will be taken and recorded , and metformin administration will be begun . In order to optimize the treatment tolerance , it will be suggested to the patients to take the pill during or at the end of the lunch . During the first week , the posology of the placebo and metformin will be 500 mg at the breakfast . After , the posology will be increased every week as follow : 500 mg morning and afternoon , then 1000 mg morning and afternoon ( 2000 mg per day ) . In case of intolerance , the maximum posology tolerated will be maintained . In fact regarding the primary data of the trial regarding the effect of metformin on colonic polyp , it seems possible that low dose of metformin are potentially active This treatment will continue until the end of the study . FOLLOW UP Patients will be seen at one month and followed every 3 months . Clinical evaluation and HCC screening are planed In CIRVIR cohort study , Every 6 months . Duration of Treatment per patient : • 36 months Duration of Trial Recruitment : • 24 months PARTICIPATING CENTERS : 26 NUMBER OF SUBJECT In order to demonstrate a reduction of 40 % ( HR 0.6 ) of events under metformin vs placebo with 80 % power and 5 % two-sided alpha risk , 200 patients per arm are necessary.A sample size reassessment will be made after 50 % and 75 % of patients included based on predictive power calculation . We estimated that 5 % of patients will not tolerate the treatment in the first month , and that 5 % more will be lost to follow or not compliant to treatment during the follow up period . Therefore , the number of patients to be included is 222 patients per group . STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Clinical data of all the patients will be prospectively collected in a computerized database Populations analyzed The main analysis will be based on the intent-to-treat population ( ITT ) of all randomized patients In addition an explanatory analysis ( PP ) of all patients randomized & treated without major protocol violations/deviations will be carried out . Pre-defined major protocol violations/deviations are : missing data for the primary efficacy endpoints no study drug received violation of inclusion criteria Additional protocol violations will be possibly defined during the blind data review Statistical tests . Main criterion : rate of HCC occurrence and liver related-death or transplantation . The cumulative incidence of HCC and liver-related death or transplantation will be compared according to metformin treatment at inclusion using the log-rank test . In addition , univariate Cox regression models will be used to identify predictive factors of primary endpoint . For each endpoint , variables with a P value less than 0.10 in the univariate analysis predicting outcomes will be entered into stepwise Cox regression multivariate models . For sensitivity analyses , the incidence of HCC will be also adjusted on usual risk factors . The same models considering competing risks will be tested using the Fine and Gray test . Secondary criteria : Occurrence of decompensation of the cirrhosis ( ascite , sepsis , encephalopathy , haemorrhage ) . Comparisons between groups will be performed first in a univariate manner using the χ2 test or the Fisher-exact tests . Multiple logistic regression models will be used to assessed a possible difference between groups when adjusted on parameters known or identified during the study as possibly affecting these outcomes .",2014-12-13,"January 10, 2017","Inclusion Criteria : Age of 18 years or older Patients included in ANRS cohort CO12 CirVir Without Hepatic local lesion ( s ) suggestive of HCC in the inclusion No indication for liver transplantation at baseline Child Pugh A or B7 at inclusion Without co-infection with HIV or HBV No history of lactic acidosis or of lactic acidosis at inclusion Insulino-resistance : ( HOMA ≥2 ) , or Body mass index≥ 25 kg/m ² without diabetes , or untreated known diabetes with HbA1c 7 An alcohol consumption , higher than 40g / day for men and 30g / day for women Type 1 diabetes Diabetes treated with metformin Diabetes not treated with metformin with HbA1c ≥ 7 % Hypersensitivity / intolerance in biguanides Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .

"University College, London",NCT02310997,Myloablative Cord Blood Transplant in Haematological Malignancies (MAC UCBT),"University College, London",2,0,Leukaemia,Other,Umbilical Cord Blood Transplant,Treatment,,"This trial is looking at using umbilical cord blood from unrelated donors after high dose chemotherapy . It is for people who have cancer of the bone marrow or lymphatic system including leukaemia and lymphoma , or a blood disorder called myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) . The trial is for babies over 4 weeks old , children , and adults up to the age of 45 .","During treatment for cancers of the bone marrow or lymphatic system , a lot of the stem cells are damaged and you may need a bone marrow or stem cell transplant to replace them . Stem cells can also be collected from the umbilical cord of newborn babies . Many people around the world have donated their baby 's umbilical cords which are stored safely . There are usually enough cells in one cord to transplant a small child , but there may not be enough cells for an older child or adult . Researchers want to see if adults and children can safely have stem cells from more than 1 umbilical cord . Before a transplant , you have high doses of chemotherapy , sometimes with radiotherapy . This intensive conditioning aims to destroy all the cells in your bone marrow , and is called myeloablative conditioning . The aim of this trial is to see if a transplant using cord blood cells from unrelated donors after myeloablative conditioning is safe , and whether it helps people who need a stem cell transplant but do n't have a stem cell donor . You may be able to enter this trial if you : Have leukaemia , lymphoma or another disorder of the bone marrow and treatment with intensive conditioning followed by a stem cell transplant is likely to help you Do not have a suitable stem cell donor in your family , and your doctors have not been able to find a matched unrelated donor Have satisfactory blood test results Are between 4 weeks and 45 years old You can not enter this trial if you : Have a family member who could donate stem cells to you , or you have a matched unrelated donor Can have any other treatment that your doctors think will cure your disease or keep it under control for a long time Have already had a lot of radiotherapy ( the trial doctor can advise you about this ) Have already had a bone marrow or stem cell transplant using your own cells Have chronic myeloid leukaemia that is in chronic phase and is responding to imatinib , or is in blast phase and is not responding to treatment Have acute lymphoblastic leukaemia that is not responding to treatment or has come back and more than 5 % of your bone marrow is made up of immature cells ( blasts ) Have acute myeloid leukaemia that is not responding to treatment or has come back and more than 20 % of your bone marrow is made up of immature cells ( blasts ) Have a disease that has come back and you are having another type of treatment ( salvage treatment ) but your disease is not responding or is getting worse Have a blood disorder called myelofibrosis Have a blood disorder called aplastic anaemia Have an infection that can not be controlled with medication Have either the HIV or HTLV virus Are pregnant or breastfeeding This phase 2 trial aims to recruit 60 people . It will include both adults and children . Everybody taking part will have intensive conditioning before having a transplant of stem cells from the umbilical cord blood of at least 1 unrelated donor . To take part in this trial , the researchers need to be sure that there are 2 lots of cord blood cells that would be suitable for you . They will only use cells from 2 cords if there is some concern that they wo n't get enough cells from 1 umbilical cord . People aged between 2 and 45 ( apart from children under the age of 16 who have acute myeloid leukaemia , juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia ( JMML ) or MDS ) will have conditioning with fludarabine , cyclophosphamide and radiotherapy to the whole body ( total body irradiation ) . This takes 9 days all together . On the last day , you have the stem cells through a drip into a vein . Children under 2 years of age ( and children up to the age of 16 who have acute myeloid leukaemia , JMML or MDS ) will have conditioning with busulfan , cyclophosphamide and melphalan . They do not have radiotherapy . This conditioning takes 10 days all together . They have the stem cells through a drip into a vein on the 11th day . The stem cells find their way into your bone marrow where they will start making new blood cells . You will see the trial team and have some tests before you start treatment . The tests include : Physical examination Blood tests Chest X-ray Lung function tests Heart trace ( ECG ) Heart ultrasound ( echocardiogram ) or MUGA scan Bone marrow test When you have your treatment , you will be in hospital for about 4 to 6 weeks . As you will be at a high risk of infection , you will be in your own room . This is called being in isolation . You have another bone marrow test a month after your transplant . When you go home , you have to go back to the hospital for regular blood tests . This is likely to be 2 or 3 times a week to begin with . You may have to go back into hospital for a few days at some point . After a transplant , you will see the doctors and have blood tests At least once a week for the first 3 months At least once a month for the rest of the first year The trial doctors will follow your progress closely for at least 2 years . The main side effect of the treatment you have just before the transplant is a drop in the number of blood cells , causing an increased risk of infection , tiredness and breathing problems . We have more information about fludarabine , cyclophosphamide , busulfan and melphalan in our cancer drugs section . It takes longer for blood cells to start growing again after a transplant of cord blood than after other types of stem cell transplant . Even when your blood count gets back to normal , your immune system may take up to 2 years to recover fully . Unfortunately , this treatment can affect your ability to have children ( your fertility ) . Men taking part will be offered the option to store sperm ( sperm banking ) before starting treatment . Preserving fertility for women is more complicated and it is important that women talk to their doctors about this before starting treatment . After any type of bone marrow or stem cell transplant , there is a risk of graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) . This happens when the new stem cells attack your body tissue . It mainly affects your skin , gut and liver . Rarely , the new stem cells fail to start working . This is more common with cord blood transplants than with other bone marrow transplants . And even if your transplant is successful , there is a risk your disease may come back . Because of these risks , your doctors will monitor you very closely after your transplant .",2014-09-18,"May 26, 2015","Inclusion Criteria : Subjects must be 45 % Transaminases and bilirubin 60mls/min Comorbidity index of 0 or 1 Exclusion Criteria : Patients with a suitably matched sibling donor or 10/10 unrelated volunteer donor available within an acceptable time period .

Those with opioid use disorder are at increased risk for smoking , nicotine dependence , and using high nicotine yield cigarettes and are also at significantly increased risk for smoking-related adverse health consequences , including site specific cancers , heart disease , and premature death . Studies testing an innovative regulatory strategy of reducing the nicotine content of cigarettes to a non-addictive level have shown promising beneficial effects ( decreased smoking rate , reduced toxicant exposure , and increased cessation ) in the general population of smokers . However , these studies have uniformly excluded vulnerable populations like those with opioid use disorder who may respond differently considering their greater vulnerability to smoking and nicotine dependence . Thus , little is known scientifically about how this highly vulnerable subgroup of smokers might respond to a nicotine reduction policy . This project is designed to address that substantial knowledge gap . This same study was also conducted in two additional vulnerable populations under a similar protocol .","The primary overall objective of these studies is to evaluate the effects of extended exposure to cigarettes differing in nicotine content in adults with opioid use disorder using a 3-condition , parallel groups design . After a baseline period in which daily smoking rate and other baseline assessments are completed , participants will be randomly assigned to one of three cigarette conditions ( nicotine content : 0.04 , 2.4 , and 15.8 mg nicotine/gram of tobacco ) for the 12-week experimental period . The cigarettes to be used in this study were made under an NIH contract with production being overseen by the Research Triangle Institute ( referred to as `` Spectrum cigarettes '' ) . NIH currently has approximately 10 million of these cigarettes ( of varying types ) for research purposes . The cigarettes selected for the study span the range of yields likely to produce the hypothesized effects , as described above . The Spectrum cigarettes are not currently commercially available , although they are similar in many ways to marketed cigarettes ( e.g. , similar manufacturing , filter , paper , etc. ) .

HIV-infected individuals have imbalances in the community of intestinal microbes which is thought to contribute to increased and persistent inflammation . The purpose of this study is to examine the safety and durability of fecal microbiota transplant ( FMT ) , the transfer of the bacterial community in stool from a healthy donor , in HIV+ individuals on anti-retroviral therapy . The study will also measure the effects of FMT on immune activation and inflammatory biomarkers in anti-retroviral treated HIV+ individuals .","Despite antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) , chronic immune activation persists and is a major driver of HIV disease progression and mortality among HIV-infected individuals . Importantly , persistent inflammation is strongly associated with increased cardiovascular events , accelerated liver disease , impaired immunologic recovery ( e.g . low CD4 count , low CD4 to CD8 ratio ) , and mortality . Therefore , addressing persistent inflammation remains a major goal to restoring health in HIV-infected individuals . Novel therapeutic strategies to decrease immune activation in treated HIV infection are needed . Marked disruption of the gut microbial composition , or dysbiosis , is characteristic of HIV-infected individuals and persists despite long-term ART . Recent studies demonstrate that the relative degree of gut microbiome disruption positively correlates with inflammatory markers ( IL-6 , kynurenine to tryptophan ratio ) . Microbial dysbiosis and its inflammatory consequences may be an attractive target for interventions to decrease immune activation in HIV+ individuals . Fecal microbiome transplantation ( FMT ) has proven durable and successful as a therapeutic strategy against gut dysbiosis , such as in the treatment of recurrent Clostridium difficile infection , by restructuring the composition of the gut microbiome to resemble that of the healthy donor . FMT has an established record of safety with limited adverse effects , even in the context of immunocompromised and HIV-infected subjects . Donor selection and screening will be conducted by OpenBiome . The objective of this phase I clinical trial is to establish the safety and durability of FMT in HIV+ individuals . The microbiome of recipients will be analyzed up to 8 weeks post FMT for evidence of engraftment from the donor microbiome . We will further examine the effect of FMT on markers of immune activation and inflammation in ART treated HIV-infected individuals .",2014-10-01,"May 2, 2017","Inclusion Criteria : HIV infected men and women 18-75 years of age .

This study also aims to define the maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) of lenalidomide given in this setting . Microtransplantation seeks to give the participant donor cells in hopes that those cells can attack the underlying cancer . However , since the donor cells do not replace all of the host cells , it can hopefully avoid many of the serious risks involved with standard transplant , including graft-vs.-host disease ( GVHD ) - a complication where the donor cells attack the participant 's normal body . Recent studies have suggested that lenalidomide can help aid donor cells to attack cancer when given after a stem cell transplant . This trial is trying to see if lenalidomide can help encourage the attack of leukemia cells by donor cells given as part of microtransplantation . The FDA ( the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ) has approved lenalidomide but it has been approved for other uses such as in the treatment of other cancers including multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma .

The investigators would like to evaluate whether intraoperative use of both drugs may be able to provide better control of pain after lumbar surgery .","During and after the surgery , patients undergoing surgery most likely need narcotics ( opioids ) that can cause side effects such as drowsiness and constipation . This can delay your recovery . The investigator would like to determine if the intraoperative use of ketamine and methadone will provide better pain control and reduce the use of narcotic painkiller medications ( analgesics ) after lumbar surgery as compared to either drug ( ketamine or methadone ) alone . Ketamine is used to help to reduce the amount of the commonly used intravenous anesthetic drugs , minimize heart rate and blood pressure instability during surgery , and to improve outcomes after surgery ( e.g . less pain , less constipation , less nausea and vomiting after surgery , faster return of bowel function and shortened length of hospital stay ) . Ketamine is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) to be used : as an anesthetic and analgesic ( painkiller ) . Ketamine is an `` adjuvant , '' which is a drug that may increase the effectiveness or strength of other drugs when given at the same time . Ketamine is administered as an adjuvant during anesthesia to produce anesthetic and analgesic-sparing effects ( reduce the amount of anesthetics and narcotics-painkiller drugs ) , hemodynamic stability ( to maintain the blood pressure and heart rate within normal rank ) and side effect reduction ( e.g. , constipation , nausea and vomiting , itching , and urinary retention ) .

Allina Health System,NCT02254681,Low-Dose Radiation Therapy to the Whole Liver With Gemcitabine and Cisplatin in IHC,Allina Health System,2,0,Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma,Drug,Gemcitabine,Treatment,,The overall goal of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of combination treatment of low-dose fractionated radiation therapy with gemcitabine-cisplatin chemotherapy for locally advanced mass forming intra-hepatic cholangiocarcinoma .,"Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma ( IHC ) are cancers with pathologic features of biliary tract differentiation which arise from intrahepatic bile ducts and/or trans-differentiation of hepatocytes . IHC is the second most common primary liver cancer and its incidence and mortality rates are increasing both worldwide and in the United States . Approximately 80 % of IHC in the Western hemisphere is the mass-forming type . Liver disease represents the major obstacle to long-term survival among patients with IHC . While partial hepatectomy offers the only hope of cure , less than 30 % of IHC are resectable at initial presentation.2 Most patients have locally advanced disease ( e.g . multi-focal tumors , major vascular invasion , local invasion of surrounding organs , and/or regional lymph node metastasis ) . Each of these factors portends poor 5-year survival ( ~20 % ) after surgical extirpation and are thus considered unresectable disease by most surgeons in the current era . Moreover , the liver is the most common site of disease recurrence after resection of IHC as 60-80 % of initial disease recurrence occurs in the liver remnant . Published response rates to preoperative or definitive radiation therapy ( RT ) for cholangiocarcinoma appear to be relatively high . For instance , a complete response proportion of 48 % was recently reported for perihilar cholangiocarcinoma patients who received preoperative chemoradiation followed by liver transplant . Moreover , small series have demonstrated superior progression free and overall survival with the combination of external beam RT and chemotherapy compared to that derived from chemotherapy alone for many unresectable hepatic malignancies , including IHC , colorectal cancer liver metastases , and hepatocellular carcinoma . For example , addition of external beam RT to cisplatin chemotherapy was associated with prolonged progression free ( median 4.3 vs. 1.9 months , p=0.001 ) and overall ( median 9.3 vs. 6.2 months , p=0.048 ) survival compared to cisplatin alone among 92 total patients with unresectable IHC . Traditional thoughts in radiation biology of tumors suggested that doses of at least 1.2 Gy were required to overcome the initial shoulder of the cell survival curve . In practice , the standard dose per fraction is considered to be 0.015-0.022 Gy per fraction although the vast majority of patients are treated with either 1.8 Gy or 2 Gy fractions . Laboratory and clinical data suggest that a new paradigm using LDFRT as a chemopotentiator may allow full-dose drug therapy with improved efficacy without adding to the toxicity of the systemic treatment . This chemopotentiating effect is possible through a phenomenon known as hyper-radiation sensitivity ( HRS ) by which there is more effective tumor cell killing than would be predicted when using doses per fraction below 1 Gy . This is followed by a change in slope of the survival response with increasing doses per fraction , indicating increased radioresistance ( IRR ) . This HRS phenomenon was first described by Joiner and colleagues in the Gray Laboratory in 1986 and has since been well described by a number of other laboratories . It also has been documented in the clinical setting ; in a study by Harney et al. , patients with paired cutaneous metastases from sarcoma and melanoma had longer time to tumor regrowth after LDFRT than with conventional radiation . In vitro studies have established a link between HRS/IRR and evasion of the early G2/M cell cycle checkpoint . Exaggerated HRS/IRR responses were found for enriched populations of G2 phase cells in one study , indicating that the mechanism likely involved events in the G2 phase of the cell cycle . Two G2 checkpoints have been described , and the more recently discovered `` early '' checkpoint is rapidly activated after radiation exposure . It is believed to prevent cell cycle progression through G2 of cells with unrepaired radiation-induced DNA damage . The signaling cascade regulating the early G2/M checkpoint is initiated through ATM activity . Joiner and colleagues have shown that inhibition of ChK1 and Chk2 , two proteins integral to the G2/M transition , can influence the cell-cycle response to low-dose radiation . It is believed that failure of the cell to repair DNA damage in G2-phase cells leads to increased apoptosis . Nonetheless , inhibition of ChK1 and ChK2 also lead to IRR at radiation doses > 0.2 Gy . This is consistent with reports indicating that low dose radiation can stimulate repair of DNA damage . Interestingly , low dose radiation can also stimulate antioxidant capacity , apoptosis , and induction of immune responses , which collectively may provide effective local tumor control . In addition , hypoxia and nitric oxide levels can also affect cells sensitivity to radiation . Reduction of nitric oxide level enhances the radiosensitivity of hypoxic non-small cell lung cancer . Therefore , the identification of cellular pathways that are responsive to low dose radiation and their contribution to chemopotentiation is highly significant because this will provide a better measurement of the therapeutic response and contribute to the rational design of mechanism-based clinical trials . Based on promising preclinical data , clinical studies have been performed in a variety of cancer types with LDFRT in addition to standard chemotherapy . Investigators at the University of Kentucky published their experience using carboplatin and paclitaxel with 4 fractions of 0.8 Gy each in locally advanced head and neck cancer patients . They observed toxicities similar to those expected from chemotherapy alone and concluded that the addition of LDFRT was `` extremely well tolerated . '' Moreover , they reported excellent response rates . Regine et al . conducted a phase I trial of low dose abdominal RT ( 0.6 vs. 0.7 Gy fractions , total 8 fractions ) and gemcitabine 1,250 mg/m2 among patients with unresectable pancreatic/small bowel carcinomas . The authors concluded that abdominal LDFRT using 0.6 Gy fractions was well tolerated when given concurrently with full-dose gemcitabine . A multi-institutional phase II trial using this regimen suggested improved efficacy of the combined regimen in improving overall survival . Sixty-one percent of enrolled patients experienced at least stable disease , and median survival in this poor prognosis population was 13 months . More importantly , no additional toxicity was observed with LDFRT other than that expected from the high dose of gemcitabine ( personal communication , manuscript in preparation ) . More recently , Wrenn et al . demonstrated tolerability of concomitant low-dose whole-abdominal RT and full-dose cisplatin in optimally debulked stage III/IV endometrial cancer patients . Currently , there are no prospective studies evaluating the efficacy of concomitant gem-cis and RT for locally advanced IHC regarding disease response or post-operative intrahepatic disease recurrence . Prior full dose external beam RT is an accepted contraindication to liver resection due to development of advanced fibrosis and intrahepatic biliary sclerosis . However , no studies have evaluated the influence of preoperative LDFRT on outcomes after partial hepatectomy . Case reports of safe liver resection after antecedent radioembolization suggest that LDFRT may not adversely affect postoperative outcomes . LDFRT to the entire liver and portal lymph node basin is advantageous compared to tumor directed therapy as the former treats occult disease representing the most common site of disease recurrence after partial hepatectomy and progression after chemotherapy . Based on data from the ABC trial establishing gem-cis as the standard of care for locally advanced and/or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma , the primary goal of this phase II study is to explore the safety and efficacy of using a combination of LDFRT as a chemopotentiator and concurrent gem-cis for mass-forming IHC . The pivotal Advanced Biliary Tract Cancer ( ABC ) Trial established combination gemcitabine-cisplatin ( gem-cis ) therapy as the standard of care for patients with locally advanced and/or metastatic IHC . While the majority of patients experience initial disease stabilization after therapy ( e.g . stable disease , partial response , or complete response ) partial or complete response occurs in only approximately 20 % of patients . Smaller trials comprising other chemotherapeutics with or without anti-biologic agents report similar results . Moreover , disease stabilization is short lived with median progression free survival of only six-eight months . Thus , there is a pressing need for more effective liver directed therapy for locally advanced disease .",2014-09-30,"October 2, 2018","Inclusion Criteria : Histologic diagnosis of mass-forming IHC .

However , knowledge on the optimal photosensitizer incubation time for AFL-PDT is limited","Photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) is widely used in the treatment of superficial skin cancer . It has an excellent cosmetic outcome , and it could be considered the first-line therapy for Actinic keratosis ( AK ) . In PDT incubation time is required so that the photosensitizer can be converted to PpIX . The recommended treatment regimen of PDT requires a relatively long incubation time with ALA ( 4 hours ) and MAL ( 3 hours ) before illumination . Theoretically , ablative fractional laser ( AFL ) pre-treatment may facilitate the penetration and distribution of topically applied drugs , since the ablated laser holes extend into the dermis , thereby possibly acting as channels for drug uptake . However , knowledge on the optimal photosensitizer incubation time for AFL-PDT is limited .

Diabetes Mellitus type 2 is an inflammatory atherothrombotic condition associated with high prevalence of thrombotic cardiovascular disease . In patient with DM type 2 , this inflammation is reflected by elevated plasma levels of several biomarkers of inflammation such as C-reactive protein ( CRP ) [ 51-55 ] . HsCRP is considered as a strong predictive of cardiovascular risks and death [ 53 , 61-72 ] . Besides its predictive role in determining cardiovascular risk , there is some evidence that CRP may represent an active participant in atherogenesis [ 54 ] . CRP is expressed in human atherosclerotic plaques and both vascular cells and monocytes/macrophages appear to represent a significant source of CRP in the inflammatory vessel wall [ 54 ] . Among the DM risk factors ( like hypertension , atherogenic dyslipidemia , insulin resistance , impaired fibrinolysis , inflammatory profile ) , definitely , inflammation is the neglected one . Moringa oleifera has been suggested to exert anti-inflammatory effects [ 42 ] [ 43 ] [ 45 ] and hypoglycemic property [ 80 ] . As with many reports of the nutritional or medicinal value of a natural product , there are an alarming number of purveyors of `` healthful '' food who are now promoting M. oleifera as a panacea .

Subcutaneous ( ly ) SMPG self-measured plasma glucose SOP Standard operating procedure WHO-DDE World Health Organization Drug Dictionary Enhanced Under physiological conditions blood glucose is kept within a narrow range by complex interactions of several signalling pathways . In this context , fine-tuning of alpha- and beta cell activity is fundamental to avoid excessive metabolic excursions . The pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) is driven by insulin resistance , followed by an increasing imbalance between alpha and beta cell activity which is characterised by relative insulin deficiency and increased glucagon secretion especially in the postprandial state . Individual arrangement of complementary antidiabetic drugs in the escalation of pharmacological intervention in T2DM is a major challenge . There is substantial need to provide a scientific rationale for the best effective combination of antidiabetic drugs with regard to their potency to address different aspects in the pathophysiology of T2DM . Therefore , studies evaluating potential synergistic and/or complementary effects of pharmacological interventions in T2DM deem imperative . This study aims to evaluate the effect of the DPP-IV inhibitor saxagliptin ( as compared to placebo ) in addition to the SGLT-2 inhibitor dapagliflozin on insulin resistance , pancreatic alpha and beta cell function . Triple therapy with metformin , SGLT-2 inhibitors , and DPP-IV inhibitors was shown to be efficacious and safe in several studies and has been approved for the treatment of T2DM by the European Medical Agency . Therefore , subjects with T2DM on a stable metformin background therapy will be enrolled in this trial . This is a single center , phase IV , prospective , placebo-controlled , exploratory , proof-of-mechanism study . This is a two-step treatment trial with a first open label and a second randomised , double-blinded , placebo controlled treatment phase . In treatment phase 1 ( TP1 , 30±4 days ) , 26 subjects will receive dapagliflozin 10 mg once daily as add on to their pre-existing metformin monotherapy . Thereafter , in treatment phase 2 ( TP2 , 30±4 days ) , subjects will be randomised to additional saxagliptin 5 mg or corresponding placebo treatment in a 1:1 ratio . Trial subjects will subsequently undergo both treatment phases , and endpoint assessments will be performed at the beginning and end of each treatment phase on Visits 2 , 3 , and 4Assignment of treatment allocation will take place at the investigational site . The total study duration for a subject will be between 64 to 84 days . The use of a combined euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic and hyperglycaemic glucose clamp protocol is chosen in order to assess parameters of insulin resistance as well as alpha- and beta-cell function under highly standardised conditions within a small study population . Trained members of staff will perform all administrations of the IMP at the clinical site . Drug accountability will be performed from Visit 2 to Visit 4 based on subject diaries and returned study medication . Whenever a deviation is noted by the Investigator , the Sponsor and/or monitor should be informed and the implications of the deviation must be reviewed and discussed . The deviation must be documented , explaining the reason for the deviation ( root cause analysis ) , actions taken and the impact of the deviation on the subject ( s ) and/or the trial . The safety laboratory will perform a first check on their values for safety parameters and flag any values outside the reference range . The Investigator must evaluate all results outside the reference range . Before the Investigator starts the trial , the laboratory reference ranges must be available in the Investigator 's Trial File . The results provided by the safety laboratory will be part of the trial database . Data Management is the responsibility of Profil Institut für Stoffwechselforschung GmbH , Neuss Germany . The objectives of the monitoring procedures are to ensure that ( i ) the safety and rights of the trial subjects are respected , ( ii ) that accurate , valid and complete data are collected , and ( iii ) that the trial is conducted in accordance with the trial protocol , the principles of GCP and local legislation . The monitor must be given direct access to the Trial Investigator File and source documents ( original documents , data and records ) . Direct access includes permission to examine , analyse , verify and reproduce any record ( s ) and report ( s ) that are important to evaluation of the clinical trial . Key tasks of the monitor include verifying the presence of informed consent , the adherence to the inclusion/exclusion criteria , the documentation of SAEs , and the recording of all safety and efficacy variables . The monitor will also confirm the completeness of patient records , the adherence to the protocol and the progress in subject enrolment . Profil Institut für Stoffwechselforschung GmbH , Neuss , Germany , will be responsible for the statistical analysis . The statistical planning and conduct of analyses of the data from this study will follow the principles defined in relevant ICH guidelines and the Sponsor 's biostatistical standard operating procedures ( SOPs ) . All statistical analyses will be performed using SAS® ( SAS Institute Inc. , Cary , North Carolina , United States of America [ USA ] ) , version 9.3 or later . For the lack of existing data for confirmatory sample size calculation , the study is designed as an exploratory proof-of-mechanism study with an experimental assessment set-up . All obtained results will be handled with equal emphasis in a strictly exploratory sense . The data obtained from the trial will serve for the purpose of thesis generation and the design of potential confirmatory studies . Dapagliflozin as well as Saxagliptin have been approved for treatment of T2DM in adult male and female patients . Because it is moreover not expected that the effects of either drug on the endpoint measures will differ between male and female subjects with T2DM , a specific gender distribution is not planned for this study . Based on a previous study in twelve patients with T2DM treatment with dapagliflozin , a group size of 12 patients in each group has a power of 80 % to detect a difference at a significance level of 0,05 ( two-tailed ) . Before data are released for statistical analysis , a blinded review of all data will take place to identify protocol deviations that may potentially affect the results . This review will be performed without revealing which trial product the subjects are assigned to . The blinding of the trial products will be maintained for everyone involved in allocating subjects to the analysis sets until data are released for statistical analysis . Furthermore , outliers will be identified by data review according to ICH-E9 , using a fake randomisation . In addition , protocol deviations , which may potentially affect the results , will be identified and it will be evaluated if subjects and/or data should be excluded from the analysis . The subjects and observations excluded from analysis sets , and the reason for this , will be described in the clinical trial report . All available data will be included in data listings and tabulations . In general no imputation of values for missing data will be performed . In general , metric variables and derived parameters will be presented using descriptive summary statistics including arithmetic means , median , minimum , maximum and standard deviations . Categorical variables will be presented using descriptive summary statistics including number of patients and percentages . Percentages of patients will be based on non-missing values . In addition , for all efficacy variables as well as the derived parameters the geometric means and coefficients of variation will be presented as well . Descriptive summaries will also be presented . Unless otherwise stated , all formal tests will be conducted at the two-sided 5 % level of significance . No alpha adjustment will be done . All analyses on primary and secondary efficacy endpoints will be interpreted in an exploratory manner . To investigate the dapagliflozin-corrected treatment effect , the evaluation of the change from Visit 3 to Visit 4 in incremental AUCGluc270-390min / AUCIns270-390min will be performed using analysis of covariance ( ANOVA ) with change in incremental AUCGluc270-390min / AUCIns270-390min as response , treatment as fixed effect and baseline ( Visit 2 ) value as covariate . From this model , least square means of change from Visit 3 to Visit 4 and 95 % confidence intervals for these changes will be calculated . In addition , estimate of the placebo-corrected treatment effect ( difference of least square mean of Visit 3 to Visit 4 changes between saxagliptin and placebo ) and corresponding 95 % confidence interval will be calculated . If the data are homogeneous or not normally distributed and can not be successfully transformed , the analysis will be performed by non-parametric technique using Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test for within treatment comparisons and Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test for between treatment comparisons based on a two-sided alpha level of 0.05 . In addition , the estimate of Hodges and Lehmann and the corresponding 95 % non-parametric confidence interval will be shown . The secondary efficacy endpoints derived from the hyperglycaemic clamp phase based on incremental AUCs will be calculated as described for the primary endpoint . All AEs that will be entered into the CRF ( all AEs since first dosing ) will be coded . All AEs will be presented by individual listings and frequency tables broken down by body system and preferred terms as assigned by the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activity , as appropriate . Separate tables for serious adverse events , by severity , as well as by relationship to trial medication , will be provided .",2014-11-11,"June 18, 2018","Inclusion Criteria : Diabetes mellitus type 2 for at least three months prior to Screening HbA1c 7.0 % -9.9 % , both inclusive Treatment with metformin ( daily dose 1500 - 3000 mg ) Age 30-75 years , both inclusive BMI 25-35 kg/m^2 , both inclusive Exclusion Criteria : Use of any oral antidiabetic treatment except for metformin ( i.e. , sulphonylureas , DPP-IV inhibitors , thiazolidinediones , SGLT-2 inhibitors ) within the last three months prior to Screening Use of insulin or GLP-1 analogues within three months prior to Screening Treatment with any other investigational drug within three months before screening History of diabetes mellitus type 1 Acute infections within the last two weeks prior to Screening Anamnestic history of hypersensitivity to the study drugs or to drugs with similar chemical structures History of severe or multiple allergies GFR ( as calculated by the Cockroft-Gault equation ) =500 ml ) , or major surgery within the last three months prior to Screening Active hepatitis B , measured by positive tests of surface antigen HBsAg and/or active hepatitis C , measured by positive hepatitis C virus antibody tests ( HCV ) at Screening Positive human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) antibodies or HIV 1 Ag at Screening",64,0,30 Years,75 Years
Fundación Marques de Valdecilla,NCT02305823,"Comparative Study of Aripiprazole, Quetiapine and Ziprasidone in the Treatment of First Episode Nonaffective Psychosis",Fundación Marques de Valdecilla,4,1,Schizophrenia,Drug,Aripiprazole,Treatment,,"The selection of antipsychotic in early stages of the illness is mainly determined by its clinical effectiveness . Second generation antipsychotics ( SGAs ) are the first line drug treatment for individuals suffering from schizophrenia . It is clear that SGAs are not a homogeneous group and clinical effects and profile of side effects differ between SGAs . Differences among antipsychotics in terms of effectiveness have turned out to be a topic of increasing research interest , although comparisons between the different SGAs are scarce . In first episode of psychosis , SGAs have shown a higher treatment effectiveness compared to first generation antipsychotics ( FGAs ) ( findings primarily driven by Haloperidol ) . Less evident seems to be the notion that some of the SGAs might be more effective ( in terms of treatment discontinuation ) than others . Most of the medium-term randomized studies have shown similar rates of all-cause treatment discontinuation in first episode patients treated with different SGAs . It may be concluded that more randomized controlled trails should be accomplished to determine the position of frequently used SGAs in clinical practice . The investigators undertook this study with the major objective of comparing the clinical effectiveness of three widely utilized SGAs ( Aripiprazole , Ziprasidone and Quetiapine ) in the acute treatment of first-episode non-affective psychosis individuals .","Study setting and financial support : data for the present investigation were obtained from an ongoing epidemiological and three-year longitudinal intervention program of first-episode psychosis ( PAFIP ) conducted at the outpatient clinic and the inpatient unit at the University Hospital Marqués de Valdecilla , Spain . Conforming to international standards for research ethics , this program was approved by the local institutional review board . Patients meeting inclusion criteria and their families provided written informed consent to be included in the PAFIP . The Mental Health Services of Cantabria provided funding for implementing the program . None pharmaceutical company supplied any financial support to it . Study design : this is a prospective , randomized , flexible-dose , open-label study . At study intake , all patients but eight were antipsychotic naïve . Dose ranges were 5-20 mg /day Aripiprazole , 40-160 mg/day Ziprasidone and 100-600 mg/day Quetiapine . Rapid titration schedule ( 5-day ) , until optimal dose was reached , was as a rule used unless severe side effects occur . At the treating physician´s discretion , the dose and type of antipsychotic medication could be changed based on clinical efficacy and the profile of side effects during the follow-up period . Antimuscarinic medication , Lormetazepam and Clonazepam were permitted for clinical reasons . No antimuscarinic agents were administered prophylactically . Antidepressants ( Sertraline ) and mood stabilizers ( lithium ) were permitted if clinically needed . The severity scale of the Clinical Global Impression ( CGI ) scale , the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale ( BPRS ) , the Scale for the Assessment of Positive symptoms ( SAPS ) , the Scale for the Assessment of Negative symptoms ( SANS ) , the Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia ( CDSS ) and the Young Mania Rating Scale ( YMRS ) were used to evaluate symptomatology . To assess general adverse event experiences the Scale of the Udvalg for Kliniske Undersogelser ( UKU ) , the Simpson-Angus Rating Scale ( SARS ) and the Barnes Akathisia Scale ( BAS ) were used .

Mclean Hospital,NCT02304432,Targeting a Genetic Mutation in Glycine Metabolism With D-cycloserine,Mclean Hospital,0,1,Schizophrenia,Drug,D-cycloserine,Treatment,Quadruple,"The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of d-cycloserine ( DCS ) as an augmentation strategy in two psychotic patients with a triplication ( 4 copies ) of the glycine decarboxylase ( GLDC ) gene . Subjects will first undergo an eight-week open-label arm of treatment with DCS ( 50 mg/d ) followed by six 6-week double-blind placebo-controlled exposures to DCS or placebo . The length of each double-blind arm is limited to six weeks to minimize the length of symptom exacerbation experienced by the subjects when they are receiving placebo . The randomization scheme will allow two consecutive exposures to DCS , but will not allow two consecutive exposures to placebo , again to minimize the length of any symptom exacerbation . At the end of the open-label DCS trial , the following procedures will be carried out : structural MRI ( 3T ) , proton 1H MRS ( 4T ) , fMRI ( 3T ) , steady-state auditory evoked potentials , and electroretinogram recordings . In addition , 1H MRS ( 4T ) for 2 hours after a single oral dose of a DCS will be assessed . Baseline data on all of these measures were previously obtained as part of a different study registered in clinical trials.gov - NCT01720316 ) . Positive , negative , and affective symptoms and neurocognitive function as well as plasma levels of large neutral and large and small neutral and excitatory amino acids and psychotropic drug levels will be assessed periodically . Pharmaceutical grade DCS ) or placebo will be compounded and dispensed by the McLean Hospital Pharmacy . The investigators hypothesize that mutation carriers will have reduced endogenous brain glycine and GABA levels and increased brain glutamate and glutamine levels . DCS administration will increase brain glycine in the two carriers compared to baseline and treatment with glycine ( 0.8g/kg ) . The investigators hypothesize reduced activation of magnocellular pathways and abnormal ERPs modulated by NMDA in mutation carriers compared with non-carrier family members and controls . . The investigators hypothesize that DCS , but not placebo , will improve positive , negative and affective symptoms as well as neurocognitive function . The investigators also hypothesize that DCS will improve clinical and cognitive functioning , will partially normalize decreased baseline glycine and GABA and increased glutamate and glutamine , and will partially normalize magnocellular pathway activation and abnormal evoked potentials .","Multiple rare structural variants of relatively recent evolutionary origin are recognized as important risk factors for schizophrenia ( SZ ) and other neurodevelopmental disorders ( e.g. , autism spectrum disorders , mental retardation , epilepsy ) with odds ratios as high as 7-30 . We have found a de novo structural rearrangement on chromosome 9p24.1 in two psychotic patients . One of the genes in this region is the gene encoding glycine decarboxylase ( GLDC ) , which affects brain glycine metabolism . GLDC encodes the glycine decarboxylase or glycine cleavage system P-protein , which is involved in degradation of glycine in glia cells . Carriers of the GLDC triplication would be expected to have low levels of brain Gly , resulting in NMDA receptor-mediated hypofunction , which has been strongly implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia . There is an extensive literature on the effects of NMDA enhancing agents on positive , negative , and depressive symptoms and on neurocognitive function . Although many studies have reported positive results in at least one symptom domain , the results of other studies have been negative or ambiguous . Factors likely to contribute to this variability include : mechanism of action of the agent , compliance , concurrent treatment with first- vs second generation antipsychotic drugs , baseline glycine blood levels , presence/absence of kynurenine pathway metabolic abnormalities and individual differences in brain glycine uptake and metabolism . Genetic variants that impact the synthesis and breakdown of glycine , glutamate , or other modulators of NMDA receptor function are also likely to have significant effects . Although DCS augmentation has shown variable efficacy in patients unselected for having a mutation that would be expected to lower brain glycine levels , the GLDC triplication in the two carriers in this study would be expected to result in unusually low brain glycine levels , supporting its therapeutic potential as an augmentation strategy . Thus , it is important to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of DCS augmentation in individuals in whom there is a high prior probability of therapeutic benefit and to characterize the neurobiology of this mutation in terms of brain metabolites , brain function , and the pharmacokinetics of glycine metabolism using well-established methods .",2014-11-26,"September 18, 2017",Inclusion Criteria : Carriers of a triplication in the glycine decarboxylase gene Exclusion Criteria : Not carriers of a triplication in the glycine decarboxylase gene,2,0,34 Years,62 Years

This usually causes infertility , which challenges many women with the condition to ask themselves , Why me ? This kind of question is about our human existence , or what some call an existential view of life . Researchers have learned that spirituality and finding existential purpose help women with POI . So does meeting other women with the same problem . Researchers want to find new ways to help women with POI cope with it . Objective : - To develop and test a practice for women with POI called Deep Reading . Eligibility : - Women enrolled in another POI protocol , who can read and speak English . Design : Participants will first have an individual visit or phone call . They will describe spiritual or existential practices they have done . They will also answer questions about spiritual and existential health and daily functioning . They will join a group for 6 weekly sessions . Each session will be 60 90 minutes . In each group session , a coordinator will teach participants about Deep Reading . They will read a piece of up to 1000 words . They will think about the piece and then talk about it with the group . Between sessions , participants will practice Deep Reading at least once for 15 20 minutes on their own . They will check in once with another group member . They will keep a log of these activities . After session 3 , participants will answer questions online about wellbeing and satisfaction . At session 6 , participants will answer questions online about wellbeing . They will answer questions about their overall experience . One and 3 months after the sessions end , participants will again complete online wellbeing questionnaires and report on their continued practice of Deep Reading .","It is well documented in the literature that women with Primary Ovarian Insufficiency find spirituality a valuable resource for coping with the existential dimension of the diagnosis . This is an exploratory pilot study which examines reading as a contemplative practice to assist these women as they attempt to come to terms with the life altering aspects of living with the diagnosis . In this intervention , that we call Deep Reading , up to 15 participants will engage in six weekly sessions approximately sixty to ninety minutes in length in which they will receive instruction on aspects of Deep Reading , practice Deep Reading and process the experience . Between group sessions participants will be asked to practice Deep Reading on their own and be paired for mutual support and encouragement .

University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center,NCT02189889,Active Preoperative Anemia Management in Patients Undergoing Cardiac Surgery,University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center,1,0,Anemia,Drug,EPO,Treatment,,"Anemia which is a decreased blood count or lower than normal hemoglobin ( hgb ) , is a major health problem for patients having heart surgery . Hemoglobin is the part of our blood that carries oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body . Anemia that is present before surgery , called preoperative anemia , is a risk factor for an increased chance of morbidity ( illness ) and/or mortality ( death ) after heart surgery . It is also an important indicator of blood transfusion necessity . Recent clinical research investigations done to study preoperative anemia suggest a blood transfusion can damage the immune system ( the system that protects us from disease ) which can lead to infection , organ dysfunction ( especially of the heart , kidney , brain ) , prolonged hospital stays , as well as increased supplies , resources and cost in surgical patients . Comprehensive anemia management can reduce or eliminate the need for blood transfusions and provide better outcomes after surgery . Therefore , controlling anemia before surgery is extremely important , and could be a lifesaving measure . This pilot , feasibility study is being done for several reasons . First of all , it will test the the safety and effectiveness of using a short-course of two medications , erythropoietin ( EPO ) and Feraheme ( iron given intravenously [ IV ] ) , to increase hemoglobin levels in order to improve preoperative anemia , reduce transfusions and lower postoperative complications in anemic patients undergoing heart surgery . Secondly , findings will be used to design a large randomized controlled trial ( RCT ) . The RCT will establish a protocol to actively manage anemia before surgery , thus reducing transfusions during surgery and improving recovery afterwards . It will also help identify valuable information regarding what needs to be done for timely completion of the planned RCT . EPO is a medication approved by the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) used to treat anemia in patients with certain conditions in order to reduce blood transfusions . And although approved for use during surgery , it has not been FDA approved for use in cardiac ( heart ) or vascular ( blood vessels , including veins and arteries ) surgery . Common side effects include nausea , vomiting , itching , headache , injection site pain , chills , deep vein thrombosis ( blood clot ) , cough , and changes in blood pressure ( BP ) . Feraheme is an iron replacement product approved for the treatment of low iron anemia in adult patients . It may cause serious allergic reactions , including anaphylaxis ( severe , whole body allergic reaction ) , as well as low BP and excessive iron storage . Patients meeting all eligibility requirements that consent to participate will be randomized into the study . Randomization is being placed by chance ( like a flip of a coin ) into one of two study groups , the treatment group or the control group . There is an equal chance of being placed into either group , which will be done by a computer . The Treatment Group will receive a 300 unit ( U ) per kilogram ( kg ) injection of EPO and a 510 milligram ( mg ) IV infusion of Feraheme 7-28 days before the day of surgery . And again 1-7 days before the day of surgery , a second dose of both of these medications will be given . The third dose , of EPO only , will be administered 2 days after surgery . Before initiating a dose or giving a subsequent dose , laboratory parameters will be measured to assess the hemoglobin level and response to the medication . If blood values increase too rapidly or are too high , the meds will not be started or , if already dosed , they will not be given again . The Control Group will receive no preoperative intervention for anemia unless lab results show iron deficiency anemia . The control group will be screened for the presence of iron deficiency anemia by evaluating blood laboratory values drawn during the baseline or preoperative visit . If lab results indicate iron deficiency anemia , over-the-counter oral iron will be recommended , to take until the day of surgery . In doing so , patients may benefit by potentially reducing the need for blood transfusions . Data will be collected from all participants from the preoperative visits throughout the admission , including lab results , medications , vital signs , information about the procedure , transfusions , and any problems or adverse events .","Anemia and transfusion are independent predictors of morbidity and mortality in the cardiac surgical patient population . Even so , active preoperative anemia management is not currently the standard of care at our institution . Cost associated with erythrocyte transfusions at University of Texas Southwestern ( UTSW ) University Hospitals exceeds twenty million dollars annually , not including costs associated with treatment of known complications of red cell transfusions ( renal insufficiency , respiratory failure , infection and prolonged length of stay , etc ) . Fifty percent of our cardiac surgical population suffer from preoperative anemia and 79 % of these patients will receive one or more red blood cell ( RBC ) transfusions . In contrast , the incidence of RBC transfusion was only 35 % in those without preoperative anemia in the calendar year 2011-12 . The mechanism of injury in patients with preoperative anemia is either the duration/intensity of the anemia exposure and resultant organ ischemia , or the harmful effects of erythrocyte transfusion ( s ) itself . Active preoperative anemia management is a strategy that attempts to minimize both of these events , and in doing so , exert an additive or possibly synergistic effect on improving clinical outcomes . A randomized controlled trial utilizing a standardized transfusion strategy is a necessary step in determining if increases in preoperative hemoglobin lead to improved outcomes . A pilot , feasibility study is the first essential step in insuring the adequacy of future trials designed to answer this important question . The APART study is being conducted to test the safety and efficacy of using a short-course ( 1-4 weeks ) of EPO plus Feraheme to increase erythrocyte mass . The findings will be used to guide the design of a randomized , controlled trial ( RCT ) that examines the effects of active preoperative anemia management on erythrocyte transfusion and clinical outcomes . The RCT will test the hypothesis that a short-course ( 1-4 weeks ) of EPO plus Feraheme is superior to the standard of care ( SOC ) at reducing transfusion and improving outcomes in anemic patients scheduled for cardiac surgery . Means and standard deviations derived from pilot data on changes in hemoglobin levels , reticulocyte counts and differences in erythrocyte transfusions and clinical outcomes will be analyzed for possible use in sample size calculations for the larger RCT . This pilot will also provide information in determining logistics for timely completion of the RCT , and will also address data collection , data management , adherence to the study protocol , transfusion and surveillance strategies and classification of clinical outcomes and adverse events . Pilot Study Specific Aims Include : To determine the proportion of patients who fulfill all the eligibility criteria for the study and agree to be part of a randomized trial of short-course EPO plus supplemental Feraheme ( up to 3 doses given over a 1-4 week interval prior to surgery ) vs. standard of care management in patients scheduled for coronary bypass grafting ( CABG ) , valve surgery , or CABG/valve surgery . To determine the adherence of patients and health care team to the procedures included in the study protocol ( scheduled appointments , surveillance and transfusion strategies ) . To determine the increase in hemoglobin levels and reticulocyte counts following a short-course of EPO plus supplemental Feraheme over a 1-4 week interval prior to the date of surgery vs. standard of care management in patients scheduled for CABG , valve , or CABG/valve surgery . To assess differences in the proportion of patients receiving erythrocyte transfusions and number of blood products utilized ( RBC , platelets and plasma ) in the peri- and post-operative periods for those receiving a short-course of EPO plus supplemental Feraheme vs. standard of care management in patients scheduled for CABG , valve or CABG/valve surgery . To determine the frequency and intensity of pre-defined clinical outcomes ( mortality , major cardiac , renal , neurological events [ associated with anemia ] and infection ) in the peri- and post-operative periods for those receiving a short-course of EPO plus Feraheme vs. standard of care management in patients scheduled for CABG , valve , or CABG/valve surgery . Differences in hemoglobin levels and reticulocyte counts from baseline to the day of surgery and postop day ( POD ) 5 , proportion of patients receiving transfusions and number of blood products utilized and the pre-defined clinical events will be assessed between the two groups . Each patient will be enrolled in the study up to 28 days before the day of surgery and for up to 30 days following the day of surgery . This pilot , feasibility study will enroll 50 subjects ( 25 per group ) . Both groups will have detailed clinical data and biological specimens collected . Visits and Procedures : Screening : Patients undergoing cardiac surgery ( CABG , valve , CABG/valve ) with anemia will be identified in advance of their operations . Basic features of patient medical and surgical histories ( i.e . age , gender , type of surgery ) will be screened . If eligible for the study based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria , they will be consented into the study . Baseline Visit : Data on demographics , lab results , vital signs , medical history , current medications , height/weight will be reviewed and recorded . Randomization by computer will be done and the patient will receive the 1st dose of study drugs , as assigned , then monitored for any serious reactions ( chest pain , dyspnea , seizures , severe headache , fever , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , increase in BP ) . Control group patients with evidence of iron-deficiency by laboratory criteria will be advised to initiate supplementation with a non-prescription , over-the-counter oral iron preparation ( ferrous sulfate 325 mg , three times a day is commonly used ) to be taken until the planned surgical operation . Pre-op Visit : Patients will receive the 2nd dose of study drugs as assigned . Vital signs ( heart rate , BP , oxygen saturation , temperature ) will be recorded before and after drug administration , then monitored for any serious adverse events ; SOC lab results ; reticulocyte count , troponin , creatine kinase-myocardial band ( CK-MB ) samples will be collected . Day of Surgery : Patient vital signs ( BP , electrocardiogram [ EKG ] , etc ) will be monitored as part of standard of care . Reticulocyte count , iron panel ( includes transferrin , ferritin , total iron binding capacity , iron level ) samples will be collected . SOC lab results , record of transfusions , estimated blood loss , adverse events will be monitored/recorded . POD 2 : Troponin , CK-MB , Rotem ( Rotational thromboelastometry ) samples will be collected . Patients will receive study drug , as assigned , then monitored for serious events . POD 1-7 : Vital signs ( BP , EKG , etc ) will be monitored ; SOC lab results , record of transfusions , and adverse events will be monitored/recorded . Estimated blood loss will be recorded on POD 1 and 2 only . Other lab to be collected : POD 1 - reticulocyte count , iron panel , troponin , CK-MB ; POD 2 - troponin , CK-MB , Rotem ; POD 5 - reticulocyte count , iron panel , aspartate transaminase/alanine transaminase ( AST/ALT ) ; POD 7 - complete blood count ( CBC ) , reticulocyte count , creatinine ; POD 14 or discharge ( whichever comes first ) - CBC , creatinine . Transfusion Strategy : Erythrocyte transfusion is permitted during cardiopulmonary bypass , during surgery and afterwards per protocol , when criteria is met . Red cell transfusions should be given one unit at a time with measurement of the pre- and post-transfusion hemoglobin levels along with physiologic parameters used to assess adequacy of organ perfusion . A consensus for transfusion thresholds was established among anesthesiologists , perfusionists and surgeons in our practice . The transfusion thresholds implemented in this protocol reflects our current `` standard of care ; '' a threshold at which clinicians generally believe the benefits of erythrocyte transfusion outweigh the risks . Adherence to the transfusion strategy will be recorded by the research nurse and protocol deviations will be discussed with the attending physician of record and a member of the clinical research team . However , research staff will not order nor prohibit erythrocyte transfusions . This will be left to the discretion of the treating physician ( s ) if he/she deems it clinically necessary . Following randomization , patient 's charts will be clearly labeled to indicate participation in the study protocol . Surveillance Strategy : The decision to initiate and continue administering doses of EPO is based on evidence accrued from randomized controlled trials and clinical practice guidelines provided by multiple sub-specialty and international societies . Substantial heterogeneity exists in factors that could be included in a surveillance strategy to minimize the risk of a thrombotic event in this setting ; with no one strategy proven to be superior . The surveillance strategy included in this protocol derives from , what we believe to be , the most current safety analyses of perioperative EPO use reflected in the literature . Implementing such surveillance methods are intended to minimize the possibly rare but potentially life-threatening adverse events . Risk factors considered in our surveillance strategy include : evidence of unstable angina or myocardial infarction , recent thrombotic event , hemoglobin levels associated with a higher risk of a myocardial event , excessive thrombocytosis or laboratory evidence of a hypercoagulable postoperative state . EPO dosing will be stratified based on patient risk ( degree of perioperative anemia ) , type of procedure ( CABG vs. valve ) and laboratory data ( hgb , Rotem ) . All doses will be given per surveillance guidelines . Primary End Point : The primary objective is to assess the enrollment rate and adherence to the dosing protocol and surveillance strategies . We define successful adherence as adherence to dosing in more than 90 % of patients for more than 90 % of the doses deemed appropriate by the surveillance strategy . Secondary outcomes will include changes in hemoglobin levels and reticulocyte counts within the two groups from baseline to the day of surgery and POD 5 , number of RBC units transfused , frequency of pre-specified clinical outcomes and incidence of adverse events in each of the study groups . Data from this pilot study will be used for the power analysis and design of the larger RCT . Adverse events ( AEs ) are events that involve physiological , social , or psychological harm to subjects or risks of harm to additional subjects or others . AEs include expected and unexpected harmful effects , and unexpected risks of an interaction or an intervention . AEs may be caused by : the test article or test procedure , other aspects of the interaction or intervention , the subject 's underlying condition , or the subject 's concurrent standard treatment . AEs may be definitely related , probably related , possibly related , unlikely to be related , or definitely not related to the research . We will report all adverse events and other reportable incidences to the Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) per reporting guidelines . Any adverse event will be documented of that event including a description , subject number , date , outcome , and follow-up . The primary safety endpoints of the study are the incidence of adverse events associated with the use of the study medications . These include : hypersensitivity ( e.g . pruritis , rash , and urticaria ) , hypertension , hypotension , bleeding , nausea , vomiting , injection site pain , deep venous thrombosis or other thrombotic complications . Surveillance for these adverse events will be conducted by direct observation ( during drug administration ) , daily bedside visits by the research nurse for the first 7 postoperative days , review of the patients medical record and listing any of these complications in the Society of Thoracic Surgery ( STS ) database . The definition of a stroke , myocardial infarction ( MI ) , mesenteric artery occlusion or peripheral vascular event will be based on STS criteria . Any event resulting in death from time of initial drug administration to hospital discharge will be recorded . The Principal Investigator , along with the Secondary Investigators , will be responsible for the monitoring , reviewing and analyses of study data . This will be done quarterly unless an issue requires immediate attention or if a recurrent pattern develops into a need for a more frequent review . An interim analysis will be done at 50 % enrollment by the principal and secondary investigators .",2014-07-11,"October 21, 2020","Inclusion Criteria : between the age of 18 and 80 years old diagnosed with preoperative anemia , defined as hemoglobin 3.0 milligrams per deciliter ( mg/dL ) unstable angina ( defined by chest pain and EKG changes indicating ischemia at rest ) thromboembolism within the past year current active primary or metastatic malignancy or history of myeloid malignancy seizures within the past year history of stroke within the last 6 months patients who have platelet count lower than 50,000 per cubic millimeter ( mm3 ) or coagulation abnormality sepsis or bacteremia defined by positive blood culture patients who have known hypersensitivity to EPO or any of its components patients who have known hypersensitivity to Feraheme or any of its components patients who refuse blood transfusion , ( i.e .

Twenty children aged 4 to 16 years of age , who spontaneously sought medical care at a primary healthcare unit , received 1.7g GOS or placebo ( Maltodextrin ) treatment for 30 days , followed by a 15-day washout period and a 30-day use of an alternative product . A clinical score was calculated at baseline , at the 15th ( D15 ) and 30th ( D30 ) day of each period , to assess bowel movement frequency , straining/ pain during defecation and stool consistency . Oral anal transit time with activated charcoal was determined at baseline and D30 of each period .","Constipation is a common symptom in the pediatric clinics . It is usually defined in terms of difficulty of passage of faeces , faecal consistency and frequency of evacuation . A diet containing high amounts in fiber can promote beneficial effects constipation therapy . Beside the fiber , functional foods , such as prebiotics , have been considered useful to regulate bowel movements . Prebiotic is defined as nondigestible food components that affect the host for stimulating selectively growth of potentially beneficial bacteria in the intestines , specially the colon . Nowadays , there are few clinical trials evaluating prebiotic use for relieving constipation symptoms in children . This clinical trial aimed to evaluate the effect of Galactooligossacharides ( GOS ) on constipated children . The trial consisted of a 75-day period double blind intervention , controlled with placebo and cross over delimitation , with two sequences of evaluation and two treatments , placebo and galactooligossacharides . It included 20 children ( 4-16 years ) with functional constipation defined by the ROMA III criteria . Children have received 6g of GOS or 6g Maltodextrin ( placebo ) , the solution was ingested for 30 days , followed by a washout period of 15 days , and afterwards , 30 more days of GOS or Maltodextrin , alternately with the product ingested in the first 30 days . The study was designed according to crossover delimitation ( GOS and Placebo ) . Eleven patients were evaluated according to the sequence GOS/placebo and nine patients with the sequence Placebo/GOS . A severity score was measured at the beginning , 2nd and 4th week in each experiment . Clinical scores , elaborated for this Trial , were used to evaluate the effect of the products considering : stool frequency , presence of pain/discomfort/effort during evacuation , consistency of stool and loss of appetite or early satiety . Scores were calculated at day zero ( D0 ) , 15th day ( D15 ) and 30th day ( D30 ) of the study , in each phase of the `` crossover '' . Oroanal transit evaluation was performed on D0 and D30 of each sequence , by activated charcoal ingestion . Descriptive analysis trough measures of position and dispersion were realized for numerical variables . ANOVA was used for the analysis of GOS effect . The significance level assumed for the statistical tests was 5 % . The GOS presented significant effect compared to placebo , reducing the stool consistency p < 0,0001 and rising the stool frequency , p=0,0014 . The value of the oroanal transit time were significant lower in GOS period , p < 0,0001 .

This is generally a severe disease which can also lead to death . The 2014 outbreak of EVD in West Africa is the largest ever . Researchers want to develop a vaccine to prevent Ebola infection . It is impossible for someone to get an Ebola infection from this vaccine .,"This is a Phase 1b ( 1b implies that the trial is occurring in a geographic region where cases of the disease against which the vaccine is directed , i.e . Ebola disease , may occur before , during or after the clinical trial ) , open label , dose-escalation study to examine the safety , tolerability and immunogenicity of an investigational Ebola virus vaccine , cAD3-EB ) Z , in Malian healthy adults . The vaccine is a recombinant chimpanzee adenovirus Type-3 vectored Ebola Zaire vaccine ( cAd3-EBO Z ) and consists of a recombinant replication-deficient adenovirus chimpanzee serotype 3 ( cAd3 ) vector expressing wild-type ( WT ) Ebola glycoprotein ( GP ) from the Zaire strain . A revision of the protocol on 14Dec2014 added a booster dose with MVA-BN® Filo or placebo in 56 subjects in groups 1 ( except for first 5 vaccines ) , 2 , 3A and 4 . The multivalent vectored vaccine MVA-BN® Filo contains an insert for the Zaire Ebola virus glycoprotein , as well as the Sudan strain Ebola virus glycoprotein , the Musoke strain Marburg virus glycoprotein , and a nucleoprotein from the Tai-Forest Ebola virus . Forty volunteers will be enrolled into two dosage groups . Another group of 40 volunteers ( Groups 3A-C ) with group 3A receiving 1.0x10 ( 10 ) vp . All study participants will receive one dose of the study vaccine by intramuscular injection . Group 4 was added to include another 11 volunteers to receive 1.-X10 ( 11 ) vp . A total of 91 volunteers have been included . Group 1 will include 20 participants who will receive the lower dose of the vaccine at 2.5 x 10 ( 10 ) vp Group 2 will include 20 participants who will receive the higher does of vaccine at 5 x 10 ( 10 ) vp . Group 3A will include 10 participants to receive 1.0X10 ( 10 ) vp Group 3B will include 15 participants to receive 2.5X10 ( 10 ) vp Group 3C will include 15 participants to receive 5X10 ( 10 ) vp ( participants will be randomly allocated to Group 3B or 3C ) Group 4 will include 11 participants to receive1x10 ( 11 ) vp . The goal of vaccinating this group is to see if there is any added benefit to the immunogenicity of this vaccine by using a higher dose . This dosage level of the monovalent vaccine has already been studied at VRC/NIH in September and at CVD in Baltimore this month in November . This dosage level was not studied in Oxford nor in Bamako . Having data on West African subjects given this dosage will be very helpful in designing the final formulation for the field trials in Q1 of 2015 . The decision will be made based on three sets of data : clinical dose-response ; immunologic dose-response ( as a proxy for expected protection ) ; and manufacturing yield and cost of goods considerations . For safety reasons , the first Malian volunteer to receive a vaccine dose in Group 1 will be vaccinated alone and we will wait 24 hours before vaccinating subsequent volunteers in this dose group . Two further Group 1 volunteers may be vaccinated 24 hours after the first , and then at least another 24 hours gap will be left before vaccinating further subjects receiving that dose of vaccine . After 5 volunteers in Group 1 have been vaccinated and followed up for 7 days , an interim safety review ( ISR1 ) will be performed by the DSMB . Enrollment of the rest of this group may proceed only if the DSMB assesses the data and indicates that it is safe to do so . Group 2 volunteers will be vaccinated without the stepwise procedure . This decision was made by the DSMB after review of safety data for 5X10 ( 10 ) from the UK trial and approval by the Institutional Review Boards . Group 3A , who will receive a lower dosage level than Groups 1 or 2 , can be vaccinated as soon as logistically possible after all subjects in Group 2 have been vaccinated . Groups 3B and Group 3C will be similarly vaccinated over a period of three days at the rate of 10 subjects per day . Group 4 will vaccinate and additional 11 participants with 1X10 ( 11 ) and will be vaccinated over 2 days ( 5 subjects one day followed by another 6 subjects the next day .

NYU Langone Health,NCT02264652,High Definition Cathodal Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation for Treatment of Refractory Partial Onset Epilepsy,NYU Langone Health,1,1,Epilepsy,Device,HD Transcranial Direct Stimulation,Treatment,,High-Definition transcranial Direct Current Stimulation ( HD tDCS ) Genuine cathodal HD-tDCS will be delivered through High-Definition electrodes that will be arranged on the skull according to a 4x1-ring configuration with the central cathodal electrode placed over the identified target and surrounding return electrodes forming approximately a 5-cm radius ring . Aim : To explore whether a novel form of tDCS can be a safe noninvasive treatment that could potentially suppress seizures in refractory partial-onset epilepsy .,"1 Introduction This document is a protocol for a human research study . This study is to be conducted in accordance with US government research regulations , and applicable international standards of Good Clinical Practice , and institutional research policies and procedures . 1.1 Background Focal Status epilepticus ( FSE ) is characterized by a prolonged , self-sustaining , and anatomically discrete seizures that last longer than one hour ( at times as long as days or weeks ) and that are associated with a definable neurologic behavior ( Schomer 2005 ) . Symptoms in FSE can vary according to the function of the brain area affected , can vary in discharge , and can be as simple as a repetitive limb movement as seen in epilepsy partialis continua ( EPC ) , or as subtle as an inability to write a command or name an object . Prevalence of EPC is estimated to be 1 per one million ( Cockerell 1996 ) . A large proportion of FSE episodes are resultant from acute neurologic insult such as stroke or hemorrhage , although , at times , the cause of FSE remains unknown . FSE treatment should commence promptly upon its recognition using predefined treatment protocols . The goal of treatment is the rapid termination of the seizure to minimize the acute and chronic effects of this emergency and to allow for the prompt assessment and management of the underlying precipitant ( Loddenkemper 2011 ) . Furthermore , patients may suffer from refractory partial onset epilepsy , and suffer from frequent seizures despite maximizing medical therapy , which may place them at higher risk of having FSE or EPC . Yet many instances of FSE , EPC , and refractory partial onset epilepsy which is resistant to pharmacotherapy , and require nonpharmacologic treatment . Accordingly , the investigatorspropose a Phase-1 clinical trial to test the safety and tolerability of High Definition Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation ( HD-tDCS ) , a -noninvasive technology with the capacity to suppress seizures in patients with frequent partial onset seizures , and eventually FSE or EPC . The investigators plan to use the Soterix HD-tDCS device . The device is a current-controlled source which generates a constant output current . In other words , the device automatically maintains constant output current by decreasing or increasing the output voltage needed as long as it does not surpass device compliance voltage , which provides an added safety measure . The HD-tDCS device poses a non-significant risk because The device is not an implant with potential for serious risk to health , safety , or welfare of subject The device is not purported for use supporting or sustaining human life with potential for serious risk to health safety or welfare of subject The device is not for substantial use in diagnosing , curing , mitigating , or treating disease or otherwise preventing impairment of human health with a potential for serious risk to health safety or welfare of subject The device does not otherwise present a serious risk to the health safety or welfare of a subject . The investigators anticipate that this will be a step toward eventual wider application of HD-tDCS . tDCS Basics : tDCS is a painless and safe method for focal brain stimulation . tDCS is based on decades-old observations that neuronal firing is modulated by low amplitude electrical direct current ( DC ) . Specifically , when applied to the cerebral cortex , cathodal DC inhibits neuronal firing . The mechanisms by which cathodal DC reduces neuronal firing likely relate to hyper-polarization of the soma membrane which occurs when the apical dendrites neuron are oriented toward the cathode in a constant electric field . The practical application of tDCS is simple : low amplitude DC is administered via broad scalp electrodes ( typically saline-saturated sponges ) such that the cerebral cortex is exposed to cathodal DC beneath one of the electrodes - the remaining , ( anodal ) electrodes can be placed anywhere else on the body , or as proposed below , circumferentially around the cathode . tDCS methods have also recently been adapted to rats for experimental work with disease models ( Rotenberg 2008 ; Kabakov 2012 ) . Over 600 studies have been published using standard tDCS without significant adverse events . In a recently published safety and tolerability study on 131 subjects involved in tDCS experiments at the University of Pennsylvania . no significant adverse events occurred . With commonly reported mild side effects of tingling ( 76 % ) , itching ( 68 % ) , burning ( 54 % ) , and pain ( 25 % ) . Direct electrical current stimulation is presently FDA-approved for extracranial use , FDA applications for cranial stimulation ( tDCS ) for management of mood disorder and chronic pain is in progress . Currently , there have been a number of clinical protocols using tDCS for cranial applications ( including previous approved protocols of the PI ) , which have considered tDCS a non-significant or minimal risk device ( please see attached documentation ) . Figure 1 : Principle of tDCS induced reduction in excitability . ( left ) Cathodal tDCS results in outward directed cortical current , which hyperpolarizes somatic cell membranes . This in turn , reduces excitability . Anodal has opposite effects . HD-tDCS technology allows uni-directional polarization ( cathodal/reduced excitability only ) as well as stimulation of a small cortical target . Thus , while leveraging the well-established mechanisms of DC control and safety of tDCS , HD-tDCS allows us to explore , for the first time , targeted hyperpolarization for seizure control . ( right ) As established over decades of research ( on right panel from Purpura and McMurty , 1965 ) DC current instantly modulates neuronal firing in a direction specific manner with cathodal stimulation suppressing firing , as well as epileptiform activity ( below ) . tDCS Advantages : tDCS units are inexpensive and light-weight . The electrical supply can be derived from conventional 9-volt batteries . The scalp electrodes can be fastened in seconds . tDCS can be combined easily with other therapies , such as those that may be required for resuscitation of an acutely-injured patient . tDCS is presently under investigation as a treatment for epilepsy , where excess cortical excitability is a prominent feature of the disease process , and where neuronal inhibition may be beneficial . Thus for SE , tDCS may offer a practical therapeutic option analogous to hypothermia or pharmacologic suppression of neuronal activity but with the benefit of easy , rapid and focal application in the setting of acute seizure or other form of brain injury . Figure 2 : Soterix Medical Inc. ( SMI ) HD-tDCS system including battery powered base unit , HD electrodes , and cap . The system has been validated in clinical trials and designated non-significant-risk by the FDA . SMI develops custom HD electrodes and `` cups '' which can be designed to integrate into EEG head-gear . The EASYcap headgear is shown with 4x1 HD electrode montage . Using the 10/20 system for electrode recording ( filled circle ) allows interlaced site for positioning of HD electrodes ( open circles ) . The EASYcap provides for a range of adult and pediatric sizes . The system is portable , can be deployed simply , and even be integrated with EEG or used while the subject is moving . 1.2 Preclinical Data Recent clinical studies of cathodal tDCS that focused on chronic treatment of epilepsy show a mild anti-epileptic effect when tDCS is delivered interictally . The rationale behind interictal tDCS application is the reliance on the tDCS effects that outlast stimulation ( plasticity ) . Though results from early animal and clinical studies suggest that such a plasticity-based approach warrants further consideration , here , the investigators propose to exploit the well-established acute effects of DC currents . Thus , what is mechanistically innovative in our approach is leveraging the robust acute effect of DC polarization ( Durand 2001 ; Kabakov 2012 ) . Refractory partial onset epilepsy represents a sustained state of brain hyper-excitability ( analogous to slice models ) , which is expected to be instantly suppressed by weak DC . High definition transcranial direct current stimulation ( HD-tDCS ) has an established safety and tolerability profile and is entering into the clinical arena for treatment of a number of neurologic disease states , such as mood disorder and chronic pain , and post-stroke motor deficit , where patients may benefit from focal modulation of cortical excitability . There has been similar tolerability data in a small number of subjects for HD-tDCS ( Minhas 2010 ) . Some subjects may experience skin irritation or redness after treatment that resolves within hours . However , in our hands at 1mA per HD electrodes , lasting skin irritations ( > 24h ) have never been observed ( N > 100 ) even in prolonged studies ( N > 40 ) . Many patients who have received both standard and HD-tDCS treatments report less sensations from HD-tDCS , likely because the electrolyte gel produces better contact with the skin compared to saline-soaked pads ( Kuo et al ) . Indeed a NSR designation for the proposed study was obtained by the FDA ( please see supporting documents ) .. Recent studies by our group and others have extended tDCS experiments to preclinical experiments in rat seizure models , and demonstrated that electrical control with tDCS aborts ongoing seizures and reduces associated brain injury . Here the investigators propose to apply cathodal HD-tDCS ( Fig 2 ) , the inhibitory variant of this technology , specifically to suppress cortical excitability and terminate seizures in a well-selected group of patients who demonstrate frequent focal onset seizures . Figure 3 : Comparison of neuromodulation focality using the HD-tDCS 4x1-Ring deployment vs. conventional tDCS ( left ) High-resolution individualized finite element model FEM computer simulations . ( top ) Conventional tDCS with large `` sponge '' pad electrodes results in diffuse and un-focal brain stimulation , which is bi-directional ( both depolarized/activated and hyperpolarized/inhibited regions ) . ( bottom ) In contrast , HD-tDCS Ring stimulation results in highly targeted cortical area stimulation . Directly under the electrodes this is unidirectional ( hyperpolarization only ) . These improvements achieved with HD-tDCS are highly relevant to the clinical aims of this proposal .",2014-10-01,"January 24, 2018","Inclusion Criteria : Age 9 to 65 years Focal-onset neocortical epilepsy ( as determined by semiology , EEG , and/or MRI ) Frequent ( > 50 % of EEG record ) focal epileptiform discharges on EEG and/or frequent ( defined as average of ≥2 daily seizures ) focal-onset clinical seizure , refractory to medical anti-epileptic treatment .

Duke University,NCT02266784,"Contingency Management, Quitting Smoking, and ADHD",Duke University,1,1,Cigarette Smoking,Behavioral,Contingency Management (CM),Treatment,,"The overall goal of the study is to evaluate how motivation and readiness for change are influenced in the context of a smoking cessation attempt . A total of 60 adult ( i.e . age 18-55 ) smokers ( N=40 with ADHD ; N=20 without ADHD ) who are interested in quitting will be enrolled into a 3-arm trial allocated as follows . Twenty of the ADHD smokers and the 20 non-ADHD smokers will be assigned to a traditional 8-week contingency management intervention in which monetary payments will be made contingent upon biologically verified evidence of smoking abstinence . The 20 additional ADHD smokers will be assigned to a treatment-as-usual condition ( nicotine replacement ; supportive counseling ) . During the treatment phase , subjects will be required to answer questions 4x/week in their daily lives via an EMA ( Ecological Momentary Assessment ) . Specific Aim 1 : To assess motivation to quit smoking and readiness for change prior to a quit attempt in treatment seeking ADHD and non-ADHD smokers . Hypothesis 1a : The investigators hypothesize that prior to a quit attempt , smokers with ADHD will exhibit significantly lower levels of intrinsic motivation to quit , and equal or higher levels of extrinsic motivation to quit compared to smokers without ADHD . Hypothesis 1b : The investigators hypothesize that smokers with ADHD will exhibit relatively less readiness for change than smokers without ADHD . Specific Aim 2 : To assess how baseline levels of motivation to quit and readiness for change are influenced during a quit attempt as a function of both ADHD status and treatment modality . Hypothesis 2a . The investigators hypothesize that the CM intervention will result in relatively greater change in extrinsic motivation to quit versus intrinsic motivation to quit , and that this effect will be more pronounced among ADHD smokers . Hypothesis 2b : The investigators hypothesize that overall motivation to quit ( intrinsic and extrinsic ) and readiness for change will be significantly influenced by the CM intervention versus treatment as usual among ADHD smokers . Exploratory Aim 1 : To assess the relative efficacy of a CM intervention versus treatment as usual in smokers with ADHD . The investigators hypothesize that CM will be more effective for promoting short-term ( 4-8 weeks ) smoking abstinence , as well as for promoting longer-term ( 3-6 months ) smoking cessation . Exploratory Aim 2 : To assess the associations among smoking withdrawal/craving , affect , ADHD symptoms , and motivation to quit/readiness for change . The investigators hypothesize that higher levels of motivation and readiness for change will be associated with lower levels of self-reported withdrawal , craving , and negative affect .","Individuals with ADHD have altered reinforcement/motivational functioning that are likely related to risk for smoking and recalcitrance for quitting . The investigators lab has demonstrated that the abstinence-induced reinforcing effects of cigarette smoking are more pronounced in ADHD smokers . However , in spite of these increases and demonstrated differences in withdrawal severity , interventions that provide reinforcement contingent on abstinence appear to work well for smokers with ADHD . To date , no studies have explicitly investigated how motivational processes are associated with smoking cessation attempts in ADHD smokers . The proposed pilot research is therefore highly innovative since it will evaluate how these processes change and influence outcomes during two different kinds of smoking cessation interventions . The project will also provide important pilot data on potential differences between ADHD and non-ADHD smokers in the context of a contingency management ( CM ) trial , which will help guide the development of more refined and targeted cessation interventions for this high risk group of smokers .",2014-10-09,"October 15, 2020","Inclusion Criteria : 18-55 years of age Male or female ; if female of child-bearing potential , must be using an acceptable form of contraception ADHD Diagnosis : For ADHD Groups : confirmed primary diagnosis , any subtype as determined by the clinician administered CAADID and clinical interview For Control Group : NO diagnosis of ADHD as determined by clinician administered CAADID and clinical interview ADHD Symptom Ratings : For ADHD Groups : T-Score > 65 on one of the DSM-IV relevant scales ( Inattentive Symptoms , Hyperactive-Impulsive Symptoms , Total Symptoms or ADHD Index ) on both the Self-Report and Observer versions of the CAARS For Control Group : T-Score 80 as assessed by the KBIT-II Exclusion Criteria : History of chronic/significant medical condition Use of any psychoactive medication in the past 12 months , other than FDA-approved medication for the ADHD group only Estimated IQ < 80 on Kaufmann Brief Intelligence Test , Second Edition Has a primary diagnosis of any other Axis I Disorder ( determined by the Structured Diagnostic Interview for DSM ; SCID ) that is significantly impairing and would contraindicate participation in the present study Has a primary diagnosis of any Axis II Disorder",33,0,18 Years,55 Years
Peking University First Hospital,NCT02267538,Dexmedetomidine and Delirium in Patients After Cardiac Surgery,Peking University First Hospital,4,1,Delirium,Drug,dexmedetomidine hydrochloride for injection,Prevention,Quadruple,"Postoperative delirium ( POD ) is a frequently occurring complication after cardiac surgery . Its occurrence is associated with worse outcomes of patients , including increased morbidity , prolonged hospital stay , increased medical cost , and higher mortality . It is also associated with long-term cognitive decline and decreased quality of life . However , until recently , pharmacological interventions that can effectively prevent its occurrence are still limited . The purpose of this study is to investigate whether perioperative dexmedetomidine use can decrease the incidence of postoperative delirium in patients undergoing cardiac surgery .","Delirium is a state of global cerebral dysfunction manifested by acute disturbance of consciousness , attention , cognition and perception . It develops over a short period of time ( usually hours to days ) and tends to fluctuate during the course of the day . The reported incidences of delirium after cardiac surgery varied from 21 % to 47 % . The occurrence of postoperative delirium has significant harmful effects on patients ' outcomes , including increased morbidity , prolonged hospital stay , increased medical cost , and higher mortality . Its occurrence is also associated with long-term cognitive decline and decreased quality of life . The exact pathogenesis that lead to the occurrence of POD are still unclear , and possibly involves mechanisms such as inflammation , pain and sleep deprivation after surgery . Furthermore , it has been shown that anesthesia management might also have exerted some effects . Studies found that avoidance of unnecessary deep anesthesia ( under the guidance of Bispectral Index monitoring ) decreases the incidence of POD . Theoretically , measures that decreases the requirement of anesthetics while maintaining adequate depth of anesthesia and those that alleviates inflammation and improves postoperative analgesia as well as sleep quality will decrease the incidence of POD . Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective alpha-2 adrenoreceptor agonists that provides anxiolysis , sedation and modest analgesia with minimal respiratory depression . Studies showed that , when used as an adjunctive anesthetics , dexmedetomidine significantly decreases the requirement of opioid analgesics and other sedatives during anesthesia . A recent study of our group found that continuous infusion of low-dose dexmedetomidine ( 0.2 ug/kg/h ) during the first night after surgery significantly improved subjective sleep quality . Two randomized controlled trials found that , when compared with traditional sedatives ( midazolam and propofol ) and analgesics ( such as morphine ) , use of dexmedetomidine in patients after cardiac surgery is associated with decreased risk of delirium . However , questions still exist as to whether dexmedetomidine prevent delirium or just does not increase its occurrence since traditional sedatives/analgesics themselves increases the risk of delirium . Furthermore , animal experiments showed that dexmedetomidine inhibits the degree of inflammation induced by endotoxins . The investigators hypothesize that use of dexmedetomidine as an adjunctive agent during the perioperative period can decrease the incidence of postoperative delirium in patients undergoing cardiac surgery , possibly by decreasing the requirement of anesthetics during surgery , by ameliorating analgesia as well as sleep quality after surgery , and by alleviating the degree of perioperative inflammatory response .",2014-10-09,"February 3, 2018","Inclusion Criteria : Patients of 60 years or older who are planning to receive cardiac surgery ( CABG and/or valve replacement surgery ) Exclusion Criteria : Patients will be excluded if they meet any of the following criteria : Refuse to participate ; Preoperative history of schizophrenia , epilepsia , Parkinson syndrome , or severe dementia ; Inability to communicate in the preoperative period because of severe visual/auditory dysfunction or language barrier ; History of brain injury or neurosurgery ; Preoperative sick sinus syndrome , severe bradycardia ( HR < 50 bpm ) , second-degree or above atrioventricular block without pacemaker ; Severe hepatic dysfunction ( Child-Pugh class C ) ; Severe renal dysfunction ( requirement of renal replacement therapy ) ; Other conditions that are considered unsuitable for participation .",285,0,60 Years,90 Years

EMPATHy will be incorporated into an existing clinic-based intervention called Coached Care , in which community health workers ( CHWs , non-professional community members ) work as a `` Coach '' to patients to help them improve engagement and communication during the medical visit .","Low income , Mexican American patients with diabetes exhibit high rates of medication nonadherence , which results in poor blood sugar control and serious complications , and often have difficulty communicating their concerns about the medication regimen to physicians . Interventions led by community health workers ( CHWs ) , non-professional community members who are trained to work with patients to improve engagement and communication during the medical visit , have had mixed success in improving outcomes . Although CHWs possess excellent cultural competency and are very effective at establishing rapport with patients , they often lack a sophisticated understanding of all the potential challenges that can come with following a regimen . The primary objective of this project is to develop and pilot test a prototype software toolkit called `` EMPATHy '' that a CHW can administer to help patients identify and articulate the most important barriers to adherence that they face .

B.P. Koirala Institute of Health Sciences,NCT02327923,Intraoperative Lidocaine Infusion vs. Esmolol Infusion for Postoperative Analgesia in Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy,B.P. Koirala Institute of Health Sciences,4,1,Gall Stone Disease,Drug,Lidocaine,Treatment,Triple,Comparison of intraoperative infusion of lidocaine and esmolol in the postoperative requirement of opioid for postoperative pain management after laparoscopic cholecystectomy to decrease opioid related side effects and enhance postoperative recovery with multimodal analgesia approach .,"Postoperative pain after abdominal surgery includes many forms of distress , such as spontaneous pain at rest ; pain during movement , including that of respiration ; and visceral pain arising from damage to internal organs during surgery . Acute pain after laparoscopic cholecystectomy is complex in nature . The pain pattern does not resemble pain after other laparoscopic procedures , suggesting that analgesic treatment might be procedure specific and multimodal . Three components have been described : incisional pain as dominant , visceral deep pain , and shoulder referred pain . Opioids are most commonly used for postoperative analgesia in laparoscopic cholecystectomy . However , they can be associated with many side effects and delayed discharge . In addition , opioids do not offer the quality of postoperative pain relief that one would expect , probably because of the pain specific to laparoscopic cholecystectomy . A single agent is unlikely to treat all three types of pain . Therefore a multimodal approach will be required . Low-dose IV lidocaine is easy to administer , has well-established analgesic , anti-hyperalgesic , and anti-inflammatory effects , and has minimal toxicity in commonly studied doses ( typically 1.5-3 mg/kg/h ) . Because postoperative pain is to a large extent an inflammatory phenomenon , administration of systemic local anesthetics , which have inflammatory modulatory properties , could significantly reduce pain and therefore allow more rapid discharge . Lidocaine has an excellent safety record when administered by low-dose infusion . In addition , intravenous lidocaine is an effective modality for treating visceral pain . Esmolol has been proposed as an alternative to intraoperative use of opioids , and found to facilitate the fast-tracking process and speed home-readiness of patients undergoing outpatient surgery . The various mechanisms of opioids dose sparing with concomitant use of β-adrenergic antagonist have been proposed from time to time such as suppression of stress hormones and pro-inflammatory cytokines , alteration of hepatic drug metabolism , activation of G-coupled proteins in cell membrane , central analgesia and so on but nothing conclusive has been established as yet . After pre operative evaluation , patients will be premedicated with oral diazepam ( 0.1-0.2 mg/kg ) at the night before and 2 hours before surgery . Informed consent will be obtained from all patients . Patients will be instructed during pre-anaesthetic visit about the use of the visual analogue scale ( 0-10 cm ) where 0 is no pain and 10 is worst imaginable excruciating pain . They will also be informed that they will be asked their pain ( VAS score ) with its character during first 24 hrs after the surgery . Both the patient and the investigator observing the outcome will be blinded about assignment of patient group during the study . The investigator will not enter the operating room but will be responsible for data collection in post operative period and data analysis . On arrival of patients in the preoperative holding area , they will be randomly assigned into any of two groups using computer generated random number . Details of group assignment and case number will be kept in a set of sealed opaque envelope . The anesthesia staff will open the envelope and prepare drugs accordingly . The attending anesthesiologist will not be involved in the data collection and analysis , and will follow the standard general anaesthesia protocol during the study . On arrival to operating room , standard monitoring will be established and baseline heart rate , non-invasive B.P , oxygen saturation and bispectral index ( BIS ) value ( Covidien ) will be recorded . A peripheral vein will be cannulated for administration of IV fluid with 18 G cannula Patient will be preoxygenated using 100 % oxygen for 3 minutes . General anesthesia will be induced with IV fentanyl 1.5 µg/kg , propofol 2-2.5 mg/kg till cessation of verbal response and tracheal intubation facilitated with vecuronium 0.1mg/kg IV . The lungs will be mechanically ventilated with a 50 % mixture of air in oxygen to maintain ETCO2 between 35 to 45 mm of Hg . At induction , lidocaine group ( L group ) patients will receive 1.5 mg/kg of lidocaine IV bolus . The lidocaine infusion ( B-Braun ) of 1.5 mg/kg/h will be started immediately after induction of anesthesia . The esmolol group ( E group ) will receive an IV bolus 0.5 mg/kg at induction followed by continuous infusion ( B-Braun ) of esmolol ( 5-15 μg/kg/min ) and titrated to maintain the heart rate within 25 % of the baseline value . Inj . paracetamol 1 gm IV infusion will be started after induction and given over 15 min . Anesthesia will be maintained in all groups with isoflurane adjusted upto 2.5 % to maintain MAP within 20 % of baseline and BIS value between 50 to 60 . An orogastric tube will be inserted in every patient before surgical incision . No supplemental opioids will be used during surgery . Supplemental neuromuscular blockade will be achieved with vecuronium IV bolus doses after observing curare notch in capnometry . Inj . ketorolac 30 mg IV and ondansetron 4mg ( 0.1mg/kg ) IV will be given after removal of gall bladder . Any episode of intraoperative hypotension ( MAP lower than 65 mm Hg ) and bradycardia ( heart rate < 50 bpm ) will be treated with ephedrine 5 mg and atropine 0.4 mg IV respectively . Patient position and monitoring Hasson surgical technique will be used . Each port site will be infiltrated with 3ml of 2 % lidocaine before incision . Pneumoperitoneum will be achieved with carbon dioxide . Patients will be positioned in 30 degrees reverse trendelenburg position and tilted toward the left slowly . Non-invasive blood pressure assessment , oximetry , ECG and end tidal CO2 will be continually monitored during the anesthesia . During pneumoperitoneum , controlled ventilation will be adjusted to maintain ETC02 between 35 to 45 mm of Hg . Intra-abdominal pressure will be kept below 15 mm of Hg during laparoscopy . At the end of surgery , patients will be returned to a supine position and the carbon dioxide left in the peritoneal cavity will be expelled by slow abdominal decompression . Isoflurane will be discontinued after the last skin suture , and the lignocaine or esmolol infusions will also be stopped at completion of surgery . 10 ml of 0.25 % Bupivacaine will be infiltrated in the incision site . Residual neuromuscular block will be reversed with neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg IV and glycopyrrolate 0.01 mg/kg IV . Thorough gastric and oropharyngeal suctioning will be done . Then , orogastric tube will be removed before endotracheal extubation . Trachea will be extubated on the operating table . Then , the patient will be transferred to the postanesthesia care unit . Postoperative Care and observation In PACU , non-invasive blood pressure , heart rate , respiration , and temperature will be monitored by nurses unaware of the study . Pain at awakening will be noted using VAS scale . Pain including its character will be assessed at rest and on movement by a VAS every 30 min by the investigator and by nurses on SOS basis on patient 's request . If the VAS for pain is more than 3 at rest , morphine 1 mg IV and Tramadol 50 mg IV will be administered in PACU and in ward respectively and repeated on SOS basis . It will be stopped if any adverse effects noticed which will include increased sleepiness , respiratory depression ( SPO2 < 90 % , R.R < 8 per minute ) . Metoclopramide 10 mg IV will be administered for grade 3 & 4 PONV .

University of Padova,NCT02327039,The Effects of Dapagliflozin on HDL Particles Subtypes and Reverse Cholesterol Transport in Type 2 Diabetic Patients,University of Padova,4,1,Type 2 Diabetes,Drug,Dapagliflozin,Treatment,Single,"In Phase 2b/3 clinical trials , Dapagliflozin has been shown to raise HDL cholesterol levels by about 4 mg/dl ( 1 mmol/l ) , which is generally considered a clinically-meaningful change . As this HDL cholesterol increase is carried out with concomitant improvement in glucotoxicity and body weight reduction , it is possible that treatment with Dapagliflozin also improves HDL function . This is important because clinical , epidemiological and experimental studies indicate that HDL function may be more important than HDL cholesterol levels in determining the protective cardiovascular effects of HDL particles . In addition , knowing the effects of Dapagliflozin on HDL function can help interpreting the increase in HDL cholesterol levels observed in Dapagliflozin-treated patients . Finally , discovery of extra-glycemic effects of Dapagliflozin will shed new light on the potential benefits of therapy with Dapagliflozin and SGLT2i in general . So far , no study evaluated the effects of Dapagliflozin ( or other SGLT2i ) on HDL function . The investigators hypothesize that Dapagliflozin , in addition to raising HDL cholesterol levels , also increases HDL functionality , measured as reverse cholesterol transport and anti-oxidant capacity , in patients with T2DM","Sodium glucose co-transport-2 ( SGLT-2 ) inhibitors ( SGLT-2i ) , a new class of glucose-lowering agents , reduce tubular glucose reabsorption , thus lowering blood glucose without stimulating insulin release . SGLT-2i have been found to be effective in improving glucose control in type 2 diabetic patients at any disease stage , and also when added to insulin in type 1 diabetic patients . In addition to the glycosuric effect , SGLT-2i reduce body weight and blood pressure and determine an increase in HDL cholesterol levels . HDL mediate reverse cholesterol transport , by extracting cholesterol from peripheral tissues and cells and vehiculating it to the liver . This function , which is regulated that by enzyme cholesteryl esther transfer protein ( CETP ) , is considered a fundamental mechanism of protection from accumulation of cholesterol in the vasculature and a physiologic barrier against atherosclerosis development and protection . The sophisticated method to precisely assess reverse cholesterol transport in vitro are available in our research lab . Although it has been reported that therapy with SGLT-2i raise HDL concentrations by about 4 mg/dL ( 0.1 mmol/L ) , the mechanisms remains unclear and it is important to assess whether or not this quantitative increase is coupled to functional improvement in reverse cholesterol transport . In fact , previous studies on HDL-raising therapies have clarified that not all HDL particles and functional and HDL cholesterol levels might not be representative of the reverse cholesterol transport processes . In addition to cholesterol transport , normal HDL particles also have anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties , that are important to translate HDL cholesterol levels into cardiovascular protection . Several HDL subclasses have been identified , having different composition and anti-atherosclerotic properties . Dapagliflozin ( Bristol-Myers Squibb Company [ BMS ] -512148 ) is a highly potent , selective , and reversible inhibitor of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 ( SGLT2 ) , the major transporter responsible for renal glucose reabsorption . Dapagliflozin lowers plasma glucose by inhibiting the renal reabsorption of glucose and by promoting its urinary excretion . A tablet formulation of dapagliflozin for oral administration has been approved in over 40 countries including the European Union ( EU ) and the United States ( US ) and is under review in numerous countries around the world . Dapagliflozin is approved by AIFA with determination number 909/2013 dated 16/10/2013 , and marketing authorization number 042494070/E . In the Phase 2b and 3 program , dapagliflozin has been studied as monotherapy and in combination with metformin , pioglitazone , glimepiride , sitagliptin , and insulin . As of 15-Nov-2012 ( date of most recent pooled analysis ) , a total of 9,412 subjects with T2DM were treated in 16 Phase 3 , double-blind , controlled clinical studies conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of dapagliflozin ; 5,952 subjects in these studies were treated with dapagliflozin for up to 80 weeks . The Phase 2b and 3 program established that dapagliflozin is effective in reducing HbA1c in a broad range of subjects regardless of disease progression/duration or concomitant use of antidiabetic therapies . Improvements in glycemic control were seen when dapagliflozin was given as monotherapy ; as add-on combination therapy to sitagliptin or metformin , to sulfonylurea ( glimepiride ) , to thiazolidinedione ( pioglitazone ) , or to insulin ( ± oral antidiabetic drugs [ OADs ] ) ; or as initial combination therapy with metformin . HDL levels and function . Observational studies provide overwhelming evidence that a low high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) -cholesterol level increases the risk of coronary events , both in healthy subjects and in patients with coronary heart disease . Based on in vitro experiments , several mechanistic explanations for the atheroprotective function of HDL have been suggested . The HDL functions currently most widely held to account for the antiatherogenic effect include participation in reverse cholesterol transport , protection against endothelial dysfunction , and inhibition of oxidative stress . Yet , several recent pharmacological and genetic studies have failed to demonstrate that increased plasma levels of HDL-C resulted in decreased cardiovascular disease risk , giving rise to a controversy regarding whether plasma levels of HDL-C reflect HDL function , or that HDL is even as protective as assumed . The evidence from preclinical and clinical studies shows that HDL can promote the regression of atherosclerosis when the levels of functional particles are increased from endogenous or exogenous sources . The data show that regression results from a combination of reduced plaque lipid and macrophage contents , as well as from a reduction in its inflammatory state . Although more research will be needed regarding basic mechanisms and to establish that these changes translate clinically to reduced cardiovascular disease events , that HDL can regress plaques suggests that the recent trial failures do not eliminate HDL from consideration as an atheroprotective agent but rather emphasizes the important distinction between HDL function and plasma levels of HDL-C . While HDL from healthy subjects can directly stimulate endothelial cell production of nitric oxide and anti-inflammatory , anti-apoptotic , and anti-thrombotic effects as well as endothelial repair processes , growing evidence suggests that the vascular effects of HDL can be highly heterogeneous and vasoprotective properties of HDL are altered in patients with coronary disease . In fact , HDL has been shown to undergo a loss of function in several pathophysiological states , as in the acute phase response , obesity and chronic inflammatory diseases . Some of these diseases were also shown to be associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease . One such disease that is associated with HDL dysfunction and accelerated atherosclerosis is diabetes mellitus , a disease in which the HDL particle undergoes diverse structural modifications that result in significant changes in its function , such as glycation and oxidation . In Phase 2b/3 clinical trials , Dapagliflozin has been shown to raise HDL cholesterol levels by about 4 mg/dl ( 1 mmol/l ) , which is generally considered a clinically-meaningful change . As this HDL cholesterol increase is carried out with concomitant improvement in glucotoxicity and body weight reduction , it is possible that treatment with Dapagliflozin also improves HDL function . This is important because clinical , epidemiological and experimental studies indicate that HDL function may be more important than HDL cholesterol levels in determining the protective cardiovascular effects of HDL particles . In addition , knowing the effects of Dapagliflozin on HDL function can help interpreting the increase in HDL cholesterol levels observed in Dapagliflozin-treated patients . Finally , discovery of extra-glycemic effects of Dapagliflozin will shed new light on the potential benefits of therapy with Dapagliflozin and SGLT2i in general . So far , no study evaluated the effects of Dapagliflozin ( or other SGLT2i ) on HDL function.We hypothesize that Dapagliflozin , in addition to raising HDL cholesterol levels , also increases HDL functionality , measured as reverse cholesterol transport and anti-oxidant capacity , in patients with T2DM . This will be a randomized , placebo controlled , parallel group study in 36 type 2 diabetic patients to assess the effects of Dapagliflozin on HDL levels and function . The general objective of the project is to detect a significant differences in the changes versus baseline of the patients ' HDL cholesterol efflux capacity , HDL levels , HDL subclasses , HDL anti-oxidant activity , CETP activity , serum/plasma cytokines and adipokines ( IL-6 , IL-8 , PAI-1 , TNF-α , visfatin , resistin , adiponectin , leptin ) in patients randomized to dapagliflozin compared to those randomized to placebo",2014-12-15,"July 30, 2019","Inclusion Criteria : Provision of informed consent prior to any study specific procedures Female and male subjects aged 18-75 years Type 2 diabetes on oral agents +/- insulin Diabetes duration > 6 months HbA1c 7.0-10.0 % Exclusion Criteria : Acute illness or infection Recent ( within 1 month ) surgery , trauma , cardiovascular event Recent ( within 3 months ) variation of statin therapy/dose Therapy with HDL-modifying drugs , such as fibrates , omega-3 fatty acids , and niacin Alcoholism Very high baseline HDL levels ( > 90 mg/dL ) Previous history of recurrent ( ≥2 episodes ) urinary tract infections or genital infections ( a single remote episode not to be considered an exclusion criterion ) History of hypotension , episodes of volume depletion / dehydration .

They always get steroids as the first treatment , but this may not work . Those people where steroids are not enough may benefit from a treatment called extracorporeal photopheresis ( ECP ) . ECP exposes white blood cells to ultraviolet light outside the body . Researchers want to study how certain markers in the blood predict the severity and outcome of acute GVHD and how ECP treatments work for people with acute GVHD . They will also study how these markers in the blood may help predict who should get ECP and its effects on the immune system . Objectives : - To learn more about treatments for acute GVHD after allogeneic stem cell transplantation . Eligibility : - Adults with acute GVHD enrolled in an National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) allogeneic transplantation protocol . Design : Transplant physicians will confirm participant eligibility . Participants will receive treatment with steroids for their acute GVHD as prescribed by their transplant physician . This will continue while they are enrolled on this study . If steroids work in treating their acute GVHD , then every 28 days for 6 months , participants will have : a physical exam . blood tests . If steroids do not work , participants will get additional treatments as prescribed by their transplant physician who may choose to use ECP as a part of this additional treatment . For ECP , blood is removed through an intravenous ( IV ) catheter . A machine separates the white blood cells from the other blood parts . Those cells are treated with methoxsalen and exposed to ultraviolet light . Then they are returned to the participant through their IV . Participants who get ECP will over at least 6 months have : veins researched . They may have a catheter placed in a larger vein in the chest or groin . multiple blood tests . multiple pregnancy tests ( if needed ) . multiple ECP procedures . At the end of ECP treatment and 6 months after ECP , participants will have additional physical exams and blood tests .","Background : Acute graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) remains a difficult to manage complication of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation causing significant morbidity and mortality . Biomarkers have recently been described in acute GVHD that have the potential to better predict onset , severity , steroid failure , and non-relapse mortality . First line treatment of acute GVHD with high dose corticosteroids will fail in approximately 30 % of patients and is associated with significant steroid related complications . No second line treatment of acute GVHD after a failure of steroids has been established as a standard approach . Choice of second line therapy for acute GVHD is currently based primarily on physician familiarity , existing toxicities , and patient 's ability to tolerate new potential toxicities . Extracorporeal photopheresis ( ECP ) is an attractive therapy to combine with other therapies for steroid refractory disease due to a unique mechanism of action involving immunomodulation as well as an extremely low rate of reported side effects and complications . Biomarkers may also prove useful in predicting the success or failure of specific treatments for steroid refractory disease , including those combined with ECP . This study will allow for collection of biomarker data in patients undergoing allogeneic transplantation on National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) protocols , including those who develop acute GVHD and investigate their role in predicting outcomes in initial corticosteroid therapy as well as in currently used treatments in the management of patients with steroid refractory acute GVHD with or without the addition of ECP . Objective : -To study biomarkers in patients undergoing allogeneic transplantation , with acute GVHD including their ability to predict steroid refractoriness and predict outcome of investigator chosen second line therapies with and without Extracorporeal Photopheresis ( ECP ) . Eligibility : - Adult patients on an NCI allogeneic transplantation protocol . Design : Non-randomized , single institution study .

To avoid unnecessary exposure of DHA-PQP again , we propose to include the results of DHA-PQP arm from these previous studies and ask the healthy subjects to participate this study for receiving only single dose of three tablet of DHA-PQP ( 40mg/320mg ) and two tablet of Mefloquine ( 250mg ) on first admission and single dose of two tablet of Mefloquine on second admission .","Artemisinin resistance poses the greatest threat to current global initiatives to control and eliminate malaria . The World Health Organisation recommends the use of the artemisinin combination therapy ( one partner drug combine with artemisinin as the back bone ) ( ACTs ) instead of the single drug . The reduction in artemisinin sensitivity has left partner drugs within ACTs exposed too much larger number of parasites and unsurprisingly cure rates with ACTs have begun to fall substantially . Recently , the Mahidol Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit ( MORU ) has applied for and received funding for an extension of the TRAC project . The proposed extension project , named TRACII , will further map artemisinin and partner drug resistance in the South-East Asian region . Also , TRACII aims to investigate the safety , pharmacokinetic characteristics and efficacy of a novel combination of an artemisinin-derivative and two long acting partner drugs , piperaquine and mefloquine . It is necessary that the potential drug-drug interactions of mefloquine and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine ( DHA-PQP ) are characterized . Piperaquine and Mefloquine are both metabolized by Cytochrome P450 3A4 ( abbreviated CYP3A4 ) enzyme which potentially results in clinically significant drug-drug interactions that can cause unanticipated adverse reactions or therapeutic failures because of the suboptimal drug exposures to the parasite . The study will evaluate the pharmacokinetic interaction and safety profile focusing on the cardiogenic effect ( QTc prolongation ) of this triple combinations of DHA-PQP and mefloquine . Piperaquine and Mefloquine are both metabolized by Cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme which potentially results in clinically significant drug-drug interactions .

University of Manitoba,NCT02321280,The Efficacy of Denosumab in Active Crohn's Disease,University of Manitoba,1,1,Crohn Disease,Drug,Denosumab,Treatment,,"Denosumab , a fully human monoclonal antibody to RANKL was approved for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis in June 2010 . It is administered subcutaneously once every 6 months and is highly effective in reducing the risk of vertebral , non-vertebral , and hip fracture risk . There are 3 main concepts underpinning the rationale for using Denosumab to treat CD . CD is associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis and the biology of osteoporosis and T cell mediated inflammation , thought to be integral in CD , involve the RANKL paradigm Animal models of bone loss and colitis treated with RANKL inhibitors improve both bone mass and colitis . A dinitrofluorobenzene sulfonic acid ( DNBS ) model of colitis in our lab showed significant improvement with Denosumab treatment compared to vehicle ( saline ) treatment . CD is associated with an increase in mutations at the locus that encodes for RANKL The investigators are conducting an open label pilot study of single dose Denosumab 120 mg s.c. to patients with active Crohn 's disease , with assessment of clinical response and remission at 12 weeks .","1.0 Hypothesis Moderate to severely active Crohn 's disease ( CD ) will respond to treatment with Denosumab , ( a monoclonal antibody to Receptor Activator of Nuclear factor-Kappa B ligand ( RANKL ) The principal research questions to be addressed : Determine if a single dose of Denosumab can induce a clinical response by 12 weeks in persons with active CD 2 . Determine if a single dose of Denosumab can induce a clinical remission by 12 weeks in persons with active CD 3 . Determine if a single dose of Denosumab can reduce markers of systemic ( C-reactive protein , CRP ) and intestinal ( fecal calprotectin , FCAL ) inflammation in persons with active CD . Background Current treatment paradigms of CD involve a step-up approach , where persons with mild disease are treated with 5-aminosalicylate ( 5-ASA ) , budesonide or even no therapy . Persons who fail to respond to these relatively inexpensive and well tolerated medications , will often require more intensive therapies including systemic corticosteroids , immunomodulatory agents such as azathioprine or methotrexate , or biologic agents . While the latter have proven efficacy in the treatment of CD , they are quite costly , and their use may result in significant side effects . Currently , the biologic agents infliximab and adalimumab , which specifically antagonize tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF ) are the ultimate step in the medical management of CD . However , nearly one-third of subjects will not respond to a standard anti-TNF based induction regimen , and response can be lost in about one-half of all subjects who responded to the initial induction over the course of one year . Of those who start an anti-TNF and respond , continuous therapy is recommended , the costs of which may exceed $ 25000- $ 40000 per year . Furthermore , the combination of an immunomodulator with an anti-TNF agent enhances clinical response , but may increase the risk of infectious complications , and their use is also associated with hepatosplenic T cell lymphoma , which is rare but almost uniformly fatal . In a population based costing study from Manitoba infliximab patients represented a very small proportion of all inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) patients , yet they accounted for a total of approximately $ 2 million in drug costs in 2005/06 , which represented approximately half of all prescription drug costs for IBD patients in Manitoba . Hence , it would be desirable to have a medication that is as effective at inducing and maintaining remission with an improved side effect profile and with a lower cost of provision . 2.1 What is Denosumab : Denosumab , a fully human monoclonal antibody to RANKL was approved for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis in June 2010 . It is administered subcutaneously once every 6 months and is highly effective in reducing the risk of vertebral , non-vertebral , and hip fracture risk . A mixed treatment comparison meta-analysis showed Denosumab to be more effective than strontium ranelate , raloxifene , alendronate , and risedronate in preventing new vertebral fractures . It is an agent that works in men as well as women . According to the 2010 Osteoporosis Canada Clinical Practice Guidelines , Denosumab is a first-line option for the pharmacological management of postmenopausal osteoporosis ( PMO ) . `` Owing to its efficacy , safety , and potential to improve adherence rates , Denosumab is considered an appropriate first-line pharmacologic option for PMO management . '' The registration of Denosumab was the culmination of the discovery and clarification of the internal bone microenvironment regulation of bone remodeling : the osteoblast-produced competitors : RANKL and osteoprotegerin ( OPG ) ; and the osteoclast receptor : RANK . Our understanding of the pathophysiology of normal bone homeostasis and the pathogenesis of osteoporosis and its integration with the immune response has been greatly advanced by the discovery of RANKL-RANK ligation on osteoblast and osteoclast precursors . Osteoblasts express RANKL which can bind to osteoclast precursors ( RANK ) or an osteoblast derived soluble decoy receptor -OPG . The binding of RANK to RANKL induces a signaling and gene expression cascade that results in differentiation and maturation of osteoclasts which can ultimately lead to osteoporosis . OPG blocks this interaction , thereby inhibiting osteoclast formation and hence decreases bone resorption . It has been shown that agents that enhance RANKL production are associated with the development of osteoporosis whereas agents that block RANKL reduce bone mineral loss . When RANKL is upregulated in the estrogen-deficient state and exceeds the amount of OPG , there is an increase in osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption , and this is the major mechanism for bone mass loss and osteoporotic fractures in the postmenopausal state . The human monoclonal antibody to RANKL ( Denosumab ) was the first product developed to reduce bone resorption by inhibiting RANKL binding to RANK . Denosumab does not accumulate in bone . Extension of the registration trial ( 'FREEDOM ' ) 5-year data indicates continued safety and efficacy , and this will be extended to 10 years to generate even longer-term data . The profound but reversible suppression of bone turnover that is seen with Denosumab partly explains the continuous increase in bone mineral density seen through 8 years of the phase II clinical trials . As noted above , Denosumab is effective in both men and women and it is potentially effective in glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis . 2.2 Rationale for Denosumab in CD There are 3 main concepts underpinning the rationale for using Denosumab to treat CD . CD is associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis and the biology of osteoporosis and T cell mediated inflammation , thought to be integral in CD , involve the RANKL paradigm Animal models of bone loss and colitis treated with RANKL inhibitors improve both bone mass and colitis . A dinitrofluorobenzene sulfonic acid model of colitis in our lab showed significant improvement with Denosumab treatment compared to vehicle ( saline ) treatment . CD is associated with an increase in mutations at the locus that encodes for RANKL 2.2.1 Osteoporosis and IBD : The prevalence of osteoporosis as defined by bone mineral density testing in patients with IBD has been estimated at 15 % . Population-based studies show only a modest excess fracture risk in IBD subjects ( approximately 20-40 % greater than matched controls ) and a rate of approximately 1 fracture per 100 patient years . Steroid use is a specific concern in IBD patients-a recent meta-analysis found that current corticosteroid use approximately doubled the risk of fracture independent of risk determined from age and bone mineral density alone . Modulating RANKL in IBD may be effective in managing IBD-associated osteoporosis . RANKL is also a regulator of T cell-dendritic cell interaction in the immune system and is a crucial factor in early lymphocyte development and lymph node organogenesis . The central importance of this system in bone and lymph node homeostasis is seen in RANKL gene-deficient mice which are unable to support osteoclast differentiation , display severe osteopetrosis ( even in the presence of bone resorbing factors such as vitamin D3 , dexamethasone , and PGE2 ) , show no evidence of bone remodeling , and simultaneously lack all lymph nodes . Activated T cells can directly trigger osteoclastogenesis through RANKL leading to bone loss , an effect that is blocked by OPG . Hence , this system may be critical in linking systemic or mucosal inflammation with altered bone metabolism and , ultimately , osteoporosis . Denosumab potently removes RANKL from circulation . Denosumab inhibits this pathway by preventing RANKL from binding to its receptor . Denosumab is therefore an antagonist of RANKL 's action . Since pharmacologic inhibition of the nuclear factor kappa beta ( NF-κB ) pathway with infliximab is efficacious for CD , then a repositioning opportunity arises . For safety , cost and compliance reasons Denosumab is an attractive alternative to anti-TNF therapy . The genetic data not only provides additional rationale for the study but focusing on individuals harboring the allele that increases RANKL expression , might provide a cohort that would achieve the greatest gain in being treated with a RANKL inhibitor . Hence we will enroll only patients carrying this G allele , since we hypothesize a slightly larger response to treatment in this subgroup . The risk allele is also relatively common ( G-allele frequency = 0.487 in haplotype map ( HapMap ) CEU ) , and therefore we expect approximately 75 % of patients to be carriers . No clinical trials assessing the effectiveness of Denosumab in the treatment of CD have been undertaken . 2.3 Denosumab safety : Denosumab has been tested in phase III clinical trials in over 10,000 people and has post-marketing surveillance data since 2010 . Although nuisance side effects have been reported with denosumab ( headache , fatigue , arthralgia ) , these have not led to clinical sequelae . Hypocalcemia : Anticipated frequency ~2-15 % ( 25-27 ) . Reported events of hypocalcemia have been mild , transient and not associated with clinical sequelae . All patients will be recommended to take daily supplemental calcium ( ≥500mg ) and vitamin D ( ≥400 IU ) per day . Serum calcium ( corrected for albumin ) will be measured 3 days post dose and every 4 weeks . Patients experiencing hypocalcemia will be treated as per the discretion of the treating physician using standard protocols . Osteonecrosis of the Jaw : Anticipated frequency < 1 % . The planned dose has been associated with osteonecrosis of the jaw . The concomitant risk factors include cancer , recent or planned invasive dental procedures and current use of anti-angiogenic medications . Individuals with any of these risk factors will be excluded from our trial . Even in trials including only high risk patients ( those with cancer ) , the incidence rates were < 2 % . All participants will receive written documentation advising them to avoid invasive dental procedures for the duration of the trial , further decreasing the occurrence of this adverse event . 3 . The Proposed Trial : An open label multicentred trial . Active therapy arm : Denosumab 120 mg subcutaneously for one dose . This dose of Denosumab has been chosen since it is sufficient to maintain elevated Denosumab levels and depressed RANKL activity as measured by suppression of bone-turnover markers at 3 months post dosing . Further , this dose is the maximal dose clinically used , has a tolerable side-effect profile and adequate pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics . CDAI is a calculated score Fecal calprotectin will be measured by ELISA in the lab of the PI . RANKL will be measured by ELISA in the lab of the PI . CRP will be measured as part of routine clinical care in each site 's hospital lab . 4 . Ileocolonoscopy or abdominal MRI will be undertaken as standard of care in each institution . Each endoscopist will record a CDEIS . Each site will make a disc of each MRI and send to Winnipeg to be read at baseline and study conclusion by a central reader ( Dr H Greenberg ) . 3.6 Sample size : N=30 assuming a 50 % response rate has a 95 % confidence interval from 33.1 to 66.7 % . 3.7 Planned recruitment rate and procedure : Recruitment will occur over a 1 year period . This trial will include 3 Canadian academic sites . We expect to screen 50 subjects and enroll 30 that means screening of 16-18 subjects per site and enrollment of 10 subjects per site . All sites are experienced IBD clinical trial centers and considering the relative ease of the study ( single dose ) with 16 weeks of follow up we do not anticipate enrollment issues . Screening Visit : Individuals will be recruited directly from clinical centers specializing in CD care . One gastroenterologist per site will be responsible for clinical care of the patient for the duration of the clinical trial . Clinical study nurses will assess individuals experiencing a CD exacerbation for possible recruitment using a checklist . Potentially eligible patients will have a blood sample drawn and sent to the Innovation Centre ( Montreal ) for rapid genotyping , which will be completed in 5 business days . If they are carriers of the risk allele , they will undergo an informed consent in person with the study nurse and will then be randomized . Fecal calprotectin and RANKL will be measured centrally at the U of Manitoba . 3.8 Anticipated compliance issues ? Since the treatment is a single dose there are no issues with compliance with therapy . In terms of compliance with follow up visits , the visits only require diary review , physical examination and blood draws and occur at 4 weekly intervals after enrollment ( except for initial blood draw for serum calcium at day +3 ) . 3.9 Anticipated rate of loss to follow up : We anticipate a loss to follow up of 20 % which is a liberal estimate considering the relative ease and duration of the study follow up . 3.10 Proposed type of analyses : Intention to treat . Time to achievement of the primary endpoint will be assessed by Cox proportional hazards and median time to event will be calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method with 95 % confidence intervals . 3.11 Proposed frequency of analyses : Single analysis at study conclusion . 3.12 Planned subgroup analyses : We will assess persons with ileal or ileocolonic disease and also separately assess persons with ileocolonic or colonic disease . 3 . 13 Follow-up Visits . Serum phosphate , calcium , complete blood count , CRP , electrolytes , fecal calprotectin and RANKL will be measured and all patients will undergo a CDAI . A serum aliquot from each visit will be frozen at -80 degree Celsius for future studies . 3.14 Study Completion Visit : At the 12 week visit , individuals will undergo all assessments done at the 4-weekly visits .",2014-12-11,"October 10, 2018","Inclusion Criteria : Subject has provided informed consent .

This project will address two critical gaps related to the integration of preventive and treatment programs : 1 ) screening and treatment of MAM/SAM have not yet been systematically integrated into routine health-center visits or mainstreamed into community outreach programs ; and 2 ) screening programs do not offer any preventive services for those children found not to be suffering from MAM/SAM at the time of screening ; mothers of children identified as non-MAM/SAM case are usually sent home without receiving any health or nutrition inputs and as a result , may fail to come back for screening because they do not see any tangible benefit associated with their participation in the screening . This project will specifically address these gaps by assessing the effect of an integrated approach consisting of higher screening coverage and preventive Behavior Change Communication ( BCC ) + Small-Quantity Lipid-based Nutrient supplementation ( SQ-LNS ) on both prevention and treatment of child undernutrition .","Because of the intended dual role of BCC/SQ-LNS on child undernutrition in this study - e.g . to help prevent child undernutrition and enhance the coverage of screening , referral and treatment of SAM/MAM , it is necessary to combine two study designs to rigorously evaluate the impact of the proposed intervention and to tease out the contribution of prevention and enhanced coverage/treatment to the overall impact on child malnutrition . The proposed study will therefore use two types of study designs . The first one is a repeated cross-sectional design that will compare select study outcomes between intervention and control groups at endline , after 24 months of program implementation . These cross-sectional surveys among children 6-23 months , at baseline and after 24 months ( on different children ) will be used to assess the impact of the intervention on the prevalence of several outcomes , including the prevalence of MAM/SAM and stunting , the coverage of MAM/SAM screening and maternal ENA/IYCF/WASH knowledge and practices .

The vaccine will be made from the subject 's blood cells and is designed to interact in the subject 's body with cells that are programmed to fight specific tumor proteins NY-ESO-1 , Melanoma Antigen Gene-A1 ( MAGE-A1 ) and Melanoma Antigen Gene-A3 ( MAGE-A3 ) . The decitabine will be given to increase the amount and activity of these cancer proteins on the surface of tumor cells to increase the possibility that the vaccine will stimulate cells to act against the tumor cells . Subjects will be assessed to determine how these tumors respond to the treatment .","One of the challenges of the practical application of immunotherapy for brain tumors is the lack of expression of tumor antigens as well as the down-regulation of Major Histocompatibility Complex ( MHC Class I and II ) molecules , which are needed for antigen presentation . Considering the ability of 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine ( DAC ) to facilitate the expression of cancer/testis ( CT ) antigens and major histocompatibility complex molecules ( MHC ) and the fact that it has good blood brain barrier penetration , it is reasonable to test this approach in a vaccine study for patients who have experienced disease recurrence . The use of a combined approach to tumor immunotherapy - antigen upregulation followed by vaccination - has not been studied in this patient population , and there is a strong biologic rationale for this strategy . Patients with pediatric brain tumors ( medulloblastoma , CNS PNET , high grade glioma ) who have experienced disease relapse or progressive refractory disease will be eligible . Each cycle will consist of DAC at low dose administered over a 5 day period , followed by two weekly vaccinations consisting of autologous dendritic cells pulsed with pooled , overlapping peptide mixes derived from full-length MAGE-A1 , MAGE-A3 , and NY-ESO-1 . This dose of DAC is lower than all previously reported doses that have been safely administered in adult patients with Myelodysplastic syndromes ( MDS ) and Acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) , and was used in a previous protocol for relapsed and refractory pediatric neuroblastoma and sarcomas . A novel way of stimulating CD4 and CD8 antigen specific T cells is to use a dendritic cells ( DC ) vaccine approach in which the cells are pulsed with overlapping peptides derived from these antigens , so that patients from several different HLA backgrounds can be enrolled . Overlapping peptide mixes derived from full-length NY-ESO-1 , MAGE-A1 , or MAGE-A3 have been acquired and consists of 15-mers , with 11 amino acid overlap . The number of DC given in our study ( 8-10 x 106 peptide pulsed DC ) is within the range of doses given in previous studies . Vaccinations are spaced at weekly intervals , based on multiple previous studies in which this approach is taken , and the fact that in vitro re-stimulation of cytolytic T lymphocyte ( CTL ) generally occurs on a weekly basis . Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) is given days 1 through 5 during vaccine weeks , to minimize leukopenia from DAC and to help facilitate antigen presenting cell function . The adjuvant poly-interstitial Cajal-like cell ( ICLC ; Hiltonol ) will be injected immediately after and adjacent to DC vaccine site to enhance DC maturation . We will accrue 10 patients with relapsed , refractory , or progressive pediatric brain tumors over a 3 year period . Cycles will repeat every five weeks , for two cycles . Patients who do not have disease progression after two cycles may receive an additional two cycles of therapy .",2014-10-20,"May 2, 2018","Inclusion Criteria : Criteria for enrollment : Relapsed medulloblastoma , CNS PNET , or high grade glioma .

These in turn result in enormous economic and social costs to schools as well as to society . These costs include mental illness , crime , and violence . Similarly , violence is widely recognized as a major public health problem which has also largely defied successful intervention and prevention . Because an increasing body of research is documenting health and neurobiological risk factors for aggression and violence , part of this prevention failure may be due to intervention efforts ignoring biological contributory factors which include impaired neurocognitive and psychophysiological functioning . One benign biological intervention that may help attenuate behavior problems in children consists of omega-3 supplementation of the diet , a long-chain fatty acid critical for brain structure and function . The overarching aim of this study is to assess whether omega-3 supplementation can reduce the base level of externalizing behavior problems in children and adolescents . A secondary but important aim is to assess whether any behavioral improvement may be greater in more psychopathic children .

Seattle Children's Hospital,NCT02272868,Fecal Microbial Transplant in Pediatric Crohn's Disease,Seattle Children's Hospital,1,0,Crohn's Disease,Biological,Fecal Microbial transplant,Treatment,Triple,This is a double blind placebo control trial of fecal microbial transplantation for active Crohn 's disease in patients 12 to 21 years of age .,"Thirty-two patients with mild to moderate active Crohn 's Disease ( PCDAI 15-45 ) aged 12-21 will be enrolled in this study . Patients will be randomized into pre-treatment conditioning + FMT versus pre-treatment conditioning + placebo . Pre transplant conditioning will include rifaximin ( 400mg PO three times a day x 10 days prior to transplant ) , MiraLAX cleanout ( 2 days prior to cleanout ) , and omeprazole ( day prior and day of transplant ) . Study subjects will have a nasogastric ( NG ) tube placed on the day of the transplant after which either donor stool or normal saline ( placebo ) will be infused via the tube . A designated clinician will do the transplants and keep the subject blinded to the treatment group . A different designated clinician , blinded to the treatment group of the subject , will do the follow-up telephone calls and visits . Study subjects will have telephone follow up 2 days and at 2 , 6 and 12 weeks post transplant they will be seen in clinic . The PCDAI will be completed at all the study visits ( excluding the phone call ) . Additionally , the physcian 's global assessment will be documented at each study visit ( excluding the phone call ) . The global assessment will be reported as quiescent , mild , moderate or severe . Study subject recipients/guardian will be provided diary cards from initiation of rifaximin to 12 weeks post transplant to record AEs , and these will be reviewed at every follow-up encounter . The diary card will include duration of event , intensity of event , and medications or actions taken for the event . Individuals who received placebo treatment will be offered FMT at termination of study . These patients will then be followed at week 2 , 6 and 12 post transplant in the CRC . Donor stool will be saved in the Clinical Research Lab at the initial baseline visit . This stool will be used for the FMT for these individuals . Randomization The study participants will be randomized using the RedCap database . All study related information will be stored in RedCap for this study . Participant data for the study will be stored electronically in the REDCap platform . The REDCap platform is managed by the Institute for Clinical and Translational Science at the University of Washington . Only IRB approved research team members will have access to the REDCap data platform . Each team members will be granted access to the REDCap data system through a secure login.The information about each participant will be de-identified using a unique study code . The randomization will be set for 16 participants to receive the FMT and 16 participants to receive placebo . For the individuals that receive the placebo , they will have the option to receive the FMT upon completion of the study . The physician that completes the FMT will be the only individual on the study team that is unblinded to the randomization . Study Procedures : Screening The screening visit will take place in the Gastroenterology Outpatient Clinic at the Seattle Children 's Hospital . At this visit , the subject recipient and donor will review the study in detail with the PI/Research Coordinator . Consent/Assent will be obtained prior to any study activities being performed . The research subject will receive a copy of the Signed Consent/Assent forms for their records . Once Consent/Assent is obtained vital signs including height , weight , blood pressure , heart rate and body temperature will be obtained for the FMT recipient only . Additionally , a physical exam and patient history including the PCDAI , Paris classification and PGA will be completed for the recipient . The FMT donor will complete a lifestyle questionnaire and the physician will review their medical history . Finally , all labs will be completed for the recipient and donor to determine eligibility . The screening labs include both blood and stool tests for both the recipient and donor . Additionally , for FMT recipients , urine will be collected for females of child bearing age for a urine pregnancy test . Some of the stool from the stool recipient will be sent to the University of Washington for microbiome analysis and storage . These samples will be de-identified and labeled with a unique study code and visit number . Consent for storage will be part of the Informed Consent process . Baseline Once all screening activities are complete and it has been determined that each subject meets all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria the subjects will return to the Pediatric Clinical Research Center at Seattle Children 's Hospital to receive or provide the stool/saline transplant . The maximum amount of time that will elapse from donor screening to procurement of stool for transplant ( screening to baseline ) will be less than 4 weeks . All FMT/placebo donors will provide a stool sample at this visit regardless of what group the recipient was randomized to ( they will not be informed of this information ) .This is the baseline visit . Prior to this visit , the FMT/placebo recipient will be randomized to a group from the RedCap database . Only the transplant physician will know which group the participant was randomized to . Prior to this visit ALL recipients will take Rifaximin for 10 days ( 400 mg 3 times/day ) prior to the baseline visit . All study recipients will also receive 20 mg Omeprazole the day prior and on the morning of the procedure . The study recipient will also have MiraLAX , 3 times a day for 2 days with the last dose at 5 pm on the evening prior to the PCRC visit . Stool transplant recipient will have stool collected for microbiome analysis at this visit . At this visit , fresh stool from the FMT donor will be obtained . A fresh sample will be defined as being less than 6 hours old . The stool weight will need to be approximately 30 grams . If the child is randomized to the placebo group , the fresh stool sample will be stored in a freezer at -80 °C . At the end of the 12 week period , children that received placebo will be eligible to receive the FMT . At this time , the donor stool will be thawed and processed according to guidelines below for the FMT . The FMT/placebo recipient will arrive fasting to this visit ( this means nothing to eat or drink after midnight prior to FMT ) . Vital signs and a physical exam will be completed at the baseline visit for the study recipient . Additionally , a urine pregnancy test will be completed for all females in the study of child bearing potential ( FMT/placebo recipients only ) . If the test is positive , they will be terminated from the study . After the vital signs are collected and the urine pregnancy test has been completed , a nasogastric tube will be placed for the FMT/placebo recipient . Placement of this tube will be confirmed by abdominal x-ray . The stool from the donor will be placed into a blender and 90 ml of the final suspension will be infused over a 3 minute period through the nasogastric tube . The nasogastric tube will then be flushed with 15 ml of normal saline over 1 minute . After 15 minutes , the nasogastric tube will be removed . The FMT/placebo recipient will be able to be discharged from the CRC after 30 minutes from the stool transplant assuming that their vital signs are stable . The FMT/placebo recipient will resume normal activity after the above procedure . The AE diary and a thermometer for measuring temperature will be given to the subject by the coordinator prior to the discharge . Some of the stool from the FMT donor will be sent to the University of Washington for microbiome analysis and storage . Each of these samples will be de-identified and labeled with a unique study code and consent for storage will be part of the IC process . If the subject is randomized to the placebo arm , all study procedures above will still take place , however , they will receive 90 ml of normal saline instead of donor feces , followed by 15 ml of a normal saline flush . The fresh stool from the stool donor will be stored frozen in the Clinical Research Center ( CRC ) Lab . The stool from the donor that is stored in the CRC lab will be used for the individuals that initially received placebo . For each group , the syringe will be covered so no one can identify what they are receiving . One clinician will be designated to complete the Fecal transplant . This clinician will not complete any of the follow up visits . After the baseline visit , the stool donors participation will be complete . Donor stool preparation for FMT Perform hand hygiene and don gloves , a gown , a mask , and an eye shield before stool preparation . Stool should be prepared in a dedicated room in the outpatient procedure area with a dedicated blender , 0.9 % saline , and large syringes . Timing of stool collection should be as close to fecal transplant time as possible , and should not be more than 6 hours before the procedure time . If frozen beforehand , please thaw for 1 hour prior to processing . Select stool specimen , preferably a soft one . Add 100-200 mL preservative-free 0.9 % saline to 30-70 grams of stool for processing in a conventional , household blender to create a homogenized , liquid slurry . Use the low setting on the blender and blend the stool sample for 2 to 4 minutes until sample is smooth and homogeneous . Strain slurry through a gauze mesh barrier to remove large particulate matter remaining in the slurry . Final prepared stool should be of a smooth consistency . For Universal Donor Stool Preparation we follow the above preparation and then amended thereafter with sterile pharmaceutical grade glycerol ( Sigma , St Louis , MO ) to a final concentration of 10 % , and stored frozen at - 80 ° C . The stool suspension will be divided into 90ml aliquots . Each 90 ml aliquot will be use separately . Thawing will be done over 2 - 4 h in an ice bath before the FMT procedure . 9 For universal donor screen the same protocol as for non-universal donor screen will be followed , including the aforementioned donor inclusion and exclusion criteria and screening labs . Day 2 and Week 24 A telephone interview will occur by a study physician to assure that the study subject recipient is clinically doing well . Any adverse events will be documented at this time . The study physician that completes this call will NOT be the same physician that completed the transplant . Week 2 , week 6 and week 12 Study subjects will return to the Pediatric Clinical Research Center for clinical follow up at approximately 2 , 6 and 12 weeks from the day of the FMT/placebo . At each of these visits vital signs including height , weight , blood pressure , heart rate , respiratory rate and body temperature will be obtained . Additionally , a physical exam and the PCDAI and the PGA will be completed . A review of the subjects AE diary will also occur at each of these visits . We will collect blood and stool from the FMT/placebo recipient at each of these visits . Some of the stool from the FMT/placebo recipient will be sent to the University of Washington for microbiome analysis and storage at each visit . Each of these samples will be de-identified and labeled with a unique study code and consent for storage will be part of the IC process .",2014-10-16,"September 23, 2021","Inclusion criteria for Stool Recipient : Children and adolescents twelve to twenty one years old , Diagnosis of Crohn 's disease made by a primary gastroenterologist based upon history , physical exam , laboratory/radiological studies and gastrointestinal histology ; Mild or moderate disease activity based upon PCDAI score ( 15-45 ) ; Parent/guardian and child must be able to comprehend the consent and assent in English ; Parent/guardian and participant must be able to attend study visits at baseline , and weeks +2 , +6 , +12 . ; Patient must not have medication changes for his/her inflammatory bowel disease medications for at least 1 months prior to enrollment . ; Stool donor available from family member ; Patient agreeable to nasogastric tube placement Exclusion Criteria for Stool Recipient : PCDAI 45 ; Active or history of intraabdominal abscess , perianal abscess , perianal fistula , intraabdominal fistula , stricturing Crohn 's disease ; Other serious medical conditions such as neurological , liver , kidney , autoimmune or systemic disease ; recipients allergic to any product used in the study , including rifaximin , omeprazole and MiraLAX ; Pregnant or nursing subjects will be excluded as transplant recipients . ; Female recipients of child-bearing potential will abstinent or willing to use adequate birth control from screening until the end of the study . ; Patients who can not tolerate NG tube placement , such as those with recent surgery or trauma to the nares will be excluded ; Presence of a condition or abnormality that in the opinion of the investigator would compromise the safety of the patient or the quality of the data ; Stool donor inclusion criteria : Family member of child participant with IBD over the age of 18 or Universal Donor known to the PI/co-PI ; Willing and able to donate a stool sample Exclusion criteria for Stool donors : High risk behaviors as outlined in the American Association of Blood Banks Donor History Questionnaire ; confirmed lab positivity for : Hepatitis A ( IgM ) , Hepatitis B ( serum antigen , core antibody ) , Hepatitis C ( IgG or IgM ) , HIV 1-2 ( PCR ) , Syphilis ( IgG and IgM ) , EBV ( IgM ) , CMV ( IgM ) ; Stool sample positive for : c. difficile , salmonella species , shigella species , campylobacter species , Aeromonas hydrophila , yersinia , vibrio parahaemolyticus , vibrio cholerae , e. coli H-0157 , H.

Randomization was stratified by baseline WHO/NYHA functional class ( II versus III or IV ) . Subjects randomized to active therapy were given ralinepag at a starting dose of 0.01 mg BID . Subjects randomized to the placebo arm received matching placebo capsules to preserve the blind . Subjects were instructed to take the study drug ( ralinepag or placebo ) with food . Dosage was then uptitrated , as tolerated , over the course of the 9-week dose-titration period to a maximum dose of 0.3 mg BID . Although doses could be reduced based on tolerability , the final dosage reached was required to be stable during the 13-week treatment period prior to evaluation at Week 22 . Subjects could receive concomitant oral disease-specific PAH therapy consisting of an ERA and/or an agent acting on the nitric oxide pathway , a PDE-5 inhibitor or a sGC stimulator , provided the dose had remained stable for at least 3 months prior to the start of screening . It was recommended that subjects continue the same dose and regimen of these medications for the duration of the study . With the exception of prostanoids , the use of other supporting therapies , which may affect PAH , was also permitted . During the study , assessments of efficacy were performed including PVR and other hemodynamic parameters as determined by RHC , the 6MWT , assessment of clinical worsening , BNP and NT-proBNP levels , WHO/NYHA functional class assessment of PAH . Safety assessments included standard evaluations of AEs , clinical laboratory values , vital signs , and ECG measurements . At the end of the maintenance period , subjects who did not choose to participate in the OLE study were to discontinue study drug ( ralinepag or placebo ) . All subjects that chose to continue in the OLE study were to remain on study drug until the follow-up visit at Week 25 . This visit served as the baseline visit for the OLE study if the subject was eligible and chose to participate .",2014-10-25,"June 25, 2020","Inclusion Criteria : Males or females aged 18-75 years , inclusive Symptomatic WHO Group 1 PAH classified by one of the following subgroups : Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension ( IPAH ) ; Heritable pulmonary arterial hypertension ( HPAH ) ; Drugs and toxins induced ; Associated pulmonary arterial hypertension ( APAH ) ; specifically connective tissue diseases , HIV infection and congenital heart disease .

Johns Hopkins University,NCT02276963,Ublituximab for Acute Neuromyelitis Optica (NMO) Relapses,Johns Hopkins University,1,1,Neuromyelitis Optica,Drug,Ublituximab,Treatment,,"Ublituximab ( also known as LFB-R603 ) is a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the trans-membrane antigen CD20 . The binding induces immune response that causes lysis of B cells . The rationale for using ublituximab in neuromyelitis optica ( NMO ) and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder ( NMOSD ) is based on the known roles of B cells , antibody production and plasma cells in the pathophysiology of NMO . NMO is characterized by the presence of an anti-Aquaporin-4 ( AQP4 ) antibody , which can only be produced by differentiation of B cells to plasma cells . Because these anti-AQP4 antibodies may be pathogenic , B cells recognizing AQP4 may be directly involved in the disease process as well . B cells also play a role as potent antigen presenting cells in NMO . The strongest evidence of the importance of B cells in NMO comes from studies of B cell depletion , most commonly with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody , rituximab ( Rituxan® ) . Rituximab has been shown in five retrospective and two prospective studies to be effective in reducing NMO relapses up to 90 % and achieving remission in up to 80 % of patients solely by its action on CD20+ B cells , despite no change in plasma cell population and anti-AQP4 antibody titers . These human trials strongly suggest a critical role for B cells in the pathophysiology of human disease . While typically used in the prevention of disease , B-cell depletion may be beneficial in the treatment of an acute relapse as well . Emerging evidence indicates that peripheral B cells are activated during a relapse and plasmablast production of anti-AQP4 antibodies spikes . B cells are also found within acute lesions of the spinal cord and optic nerve suggesting roles both in the blood and in the central nervous system during a relapse .","The overall objective is to assess the safety of ublituximab as add-on therapy to steroids for treatment of acute optic neuritis and/or transverse myelitis in NMO and NMOSD . Primary Objective To assess safety of acute B cell depletion in NMO subjects with acute relapse of optic neuritis or transverse myelitis who are treated with ublituximab + glucocorticoids beginning on dose administration and ending with recovery of B cells . Secondary Objectives To determine the B cell depletion pharmacokinetics of ublituximab in the NMO patients population with monthly B cell counts for up to 9 months . To determine the frequency of adverse events with ublituximab in this patient population . Trial Design Given the severity and the consequences of relapse in NMO , placebo treatment without steroid treatment is unethical and use of an active treatment is considered mandatory . The potential of currently utilized drugs and techniques to reduce the inflammation in NMO has been established primarily through expert consensus and small open label and retrospective studies . This is a Phase 1 open-label , standard-of-care , single treatment arm , unblinded , single center interventional trial in NMO/NMOSD patients in which experimental subjects will receive one ( 1 ) infusion of 450 mg of intravenous ublituximab at the onset of an NMO exacerbation in addition to standard of care treatment with daily intravenous glucocorticoid at 1000 mg for five days .",2014-10-21,"June 5, 2019","Inclusion Criteria : Able and willing to provide written informed consent . 18-100 years of age .

Nucleic acid polymers have been previously shown to clear serum hepatitis B virus surface antigen ( HBsAg ) both preclinically ( in duck HBV infected ducks ) and in human patients and to act synergistically with immunotherapeutic agents such as pegylated interferon-alpha 2a or thymosin alpha-1 to restore host immunological control of HBV infection . HBsAg is an essential component of the hepatitis D virus ( HDV ) , therefore the direct action of REP 2139-Ca in removing serum HBsAg and its synergistic effect with pegylated interferon-alpha 2a is expected to have a significant antiviral effect against HDV infection . This study will examine the safety and efficacy of REP 2139-Ca therapy when used in combination with pegylated interferon alpha-2a in patients with HBV / HDV co-infection . The primary hypothesis to be tested is that this combined dosing regimen is safe and well tolerated in patients with HBV / HDV co-infection which will be assessed by examining the number of patients with adverse events ( including reported symptoms and laboratory abnormalities ) . The secondary hypothesis to be tested is that this combined dosing regimen will have an antiviral effect against HBV / HDV co-infection in these patients which will be assessed by examining the following outcomes : The number of patients with reductions in serum HBsAg . The number of patients with reductions in serum HDAg and HDV RNA The number of patients that experience a sustained antiviral response after treatment is stopped ( reductions in serum HBV DNA and HDV RNA ) . The secondary hypothesis to be tested is that this combination approach can have an effective","Nucleic acid polymers ( NAPs ) utilize the sequence independent properties of phosphorothioated oligonucleotides to target apolipoprotein interactions involved in the formation of HBV subviral particles ( SVPs ) which are comprised mainly of the hepatitis B surface antigen protein ( HBsAg ) . The effect of NAPs is to block the formation of SVPs inside infected hepatocytes which prevents their secretion . As SVPs account for > 99.99 % of HBsAg in the blood , NAPs are an effective approach for clearing HBsAg from the serum of HBV infected patient . Previous clinical trials have demonstrated that treatment with the NAP REP 2139 results in the rapid and effective clearance of HBsAg from the blood . This HBsAg removal has the immediate effect of unmasking the underlying , pre-existing anti-HBsAg ( anti-HBs ) response , allowing clearance of HBV virus from the blood . HBsAg has important immunosuppressive effects in HBV infection which have been shown to block both adaptive and innate immune processes . Removal of HBsAg from the blood of patients removes this immunosuppressive effect . Thus , an important additional effect of removal of HBsAg from the blood is to greatly enhance the effect of immunotherapeutic agents like pegylated interferon alpha-2a or thymosin alpha-1 to stimulate recovery of complete immune control of HBV infection . HDV superinfection can only occur in patients with HBV infection because HDV requires the HBsAg protein for its assembly . Therefore , it is expected that the removal of serum HBsAg ( from HBV SVPs ) and unmasking of the anticipated , pre-existing anti-HBsAg response by REP 2139 will result in the clearance of HBV and HDV from the blood . Furthermore , the enhanced effect of immunotherapy in the absence of serum HBsAg has the potential to provide a durable control of both HBV and HDV infection that will persist after treatment .",2014-09-01,"September 26, 2017","Inclusion Criteria : Age between 18 and 55 years HBsAg > 1000 IU / ml HDAg+ HDV RNA + No detectable antibodies to HIV , HCV or CMV .

Hospital do Coracao,NCT02232919,Deep Brain Stimulation for Human Morbid Obesity,Hospital do Coracao,1,1,Obesity,Device,Deep Brain Stimulation,Treatment,,"The burden of morbid obesity to the circulatory , endocrine , and locomotor systems , as well as the psychological effects and related health-care costs , are well established in the medical literature . Lifestyle and dietary patterns remain critical factors modulating long-term weight control of morbidly obese individuals ( bodymass index ≥ 40 ) . Various dietary , pharmacological , and behavioral interventions have largely failed as therapies , often necessitating surgery as the last treatment option . Long term results of bariatric surgery suggest that sustained and substantial weight loss can decrease morbidity related to obesity secondary complications such as diabetes type 2 and cancers , enhancing the role of surgery for morbidly obese subjects . However the adverse effects of bariatric surgery are considerable and impact on quality of life . Its long-term failure rates and complications call for novel and effective long-term therapies , such as neurosurgical interventions . The investigators now propose to enhance our targeting capabilities in a feasibility study of low frequency electrical stimulation using VMH-DBS ( ventromedial hypothalamic ) in six morbidly obese patients . After successful targeting , DBS stimulation parameters will be systematically evaluated and individually optimized at three-month intervals over a one-year stimulation period . Detailed recording of side effects , weight changes , food intake patterns , metabolic changes , and behavioral evaluations will be obtained throughout the study .","Neuromodulation of metabolism and feeding behavior is at hand using modern systems of deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) . It constitutes a minimally invasive approach for these challenging patients . The surgical procedure is reversible and proven to have acceptable side effects in the frail population of Parkinson 's disease patients [ Gorgulho , Hemorrhage and Infection ] . Improvement of functional stereotactic surgery methods is necessary however to the challenge of implanting DBS electrodes in the hypothalamus . Recently , a case report of a patient with DBS implanted in the hypothalamus for treatment of morbid obesity who reported side effects related to memory appeared in the literature . The authors used the side effect findings to suggest the location of their implant as a site for treatment of Alzheimer 's disease .

VA Office of Research and Development,NCT02230891,Biomarker Guided Therapies in Stage A/B Heart Failure,VA Office of Research and Development,2,1,Hypertension,Drug,Carvedilol,Prevention,,"Despite advances in cardiovascular care , the occurrence of heart failure ( HF ) is steadily increasing . The increase in HF rates poses enormous challenges , as once an individual becomes symptomatic or requires hospitalization with HF , the prognosis remains poor . Therefore , prevention of HF is essential . HF prevention is a critical issue as HF risk factors that include common medical conditions such as hypertension and diabetes are also increasing . However , not everyone with these risk factors develops HF . Using novel blood tests , the investigators propose to identify and treat subjects at higher HF risk to see if the investigators can stabilize or improve ultrasound measures known to be associated with HF risk . This study will enroll only Veterans .","Recently the investigators have shown that HF risk prediction can be improved using cardiac troponin T measured with a novel high-sensitivity assay ( hs-cTnT ) and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide ( NT-proBNP ) . Furthermore , hs-cTnT seems to identify individuals at higher risk among those with established risk factors ( such as hypertension ) for HF . In preliminary results , the investigators have shown that individuals with systolic blood pressure of 120-129 mm Hg and elevated hs-cTnT have a higher rate of incident HF than those with systolic blood pressure of 140-159 mm Hg and undetectable hs-cTnT . Therefore , the investigators believe that by using hs-cTnT to estimate HF risk the investigators can identify individuals in whom aggressive modification of risk factors such as high blood pressure will be associated with a favorable risk-benefit ratio . The investigators ' objective/specific aim therefore is to evaluate if treatment of selected subjects with Stage A or B HF ( i.e. , those with hs-cTnT > 5 ng/L and an estimated 10-year HF hospitalization risk of > 5 % ) who have reasonably well-controlled blood pressure with antihypertensive agents ( carvedilol or spironolactone ) will be associated with improvement of surrogate markers associated with incident HF ( i.e. , speckle-tracked cardiac and vascular strain ) . Carvedilol and spironolactone were chosen for the following reasons : a ) they are not routinely used as first-line antihypertensive agents ; b ) beta-blockade was associated with decreases in hs-cTnT in the preliminary analysis of subjects with established HF ; and c ) the mechanism of actions of carvedilol and spironolactone provide a sound scientific rationale for use in prevention of HF . Using a prospective open-label blinded end point ( PROBE ) design , the investigators propose to randomize 210 subjects aged > 40 years with systolic blood pressure between 120-155 mm Hg , cardiac troponin T ( measured with a novel high-sensitivity assay ) level > 5 ng/L , and 10-year HF risk > 5 % ( estimated using a validated laboratory model including demographic factors , NT-proBNP , and hs-cTnT ) to receive carvedilol ( nonselective beta-blocker ) , spironolactone ( aldosterone antagonist ) , or usual care for 18 months . The primary end point will be change in global longitudinal systolic myocardial strain estimated using 2D speckle tracking . Additionally , changes in vascular strain and biomarkers will be evaluated . This study will help us identify whether both or either of the medications can be further tested in large randomized clinical trials to prevent the incidence of HF .",2014-08-28,"October 19, 2022","Inclusion Criteria : Only Veterans are eligible to participate .

Albert Einstein Healthcare Network,NCT02369744,Silodosin Versus Tamsulosin for Treatment of Ureteral Stones,Albert Einstein Healthcare Network,4,0,Ureteral Calculus,Drug,Silodosin,Treatment,Quadruple,"Ureteral calculi , commonly known as kidney stones , are a frequent cause of Emergency Department ( ED ) visits . These stones can get caught in the ureter ( the tube connecting the kidney to the bladder ) and cause symptoms including pain , nausea , and vomiting . As long as the obstructing stone meets certain conditions and the patient is n't too sick , the patient is usually sent home to try and pass the stone without surgery . This treatment is known as medical expulsive therapy ( MET ) , and routinely involves the use of a drug called tamsulosin , which relaxes the smooth muscle of the urinary system to help the stone pass . Silodosin is a drug in the same class of tamsulosin , but which is thought to have a more selective action and a quicker onset , which would theoretically make it better for aiding in kidney stone passage . The purpose of this study is a head-to-head , blinded comparison of these two drugs to see how quickly they result in stone passage . Subjects are patients presenting to the ED with acute kidney stone shown by CT scan , and who are appropriate for MET . The main study intervention is randomization to receiving either tamsulosin or silodosin . The hypothesis is that silodosin will have decreased time to stone passage compared to tamsulosin . Subjects who qualify and consent are randomized to a two-week course of either silodosin or tamsulosin . They are also given prescriptions for standard of care medications for pain and nausea , as well as a pain diary . They receive a follow-up phone call after one week to remind them of their follow-up appointment , ask about adverse events , and determine if their stone has passed . They have a follow-up visit with study staff at the end of their two week treatment to collect their pain diary , pill count , adverse events , and to determine if their stone has passed . Study participation ends after this follow-up visit .","Procedures Involved in the Research . This study is a prospective , randomized , double-blinded , head-to-head trial comparing two medications . Patients with symptoms of renal colic who present to the emergency department will be evaluated by the ED staff as per usual routine . After a work-up ( including routine chemistry , complete blood count , urine analysis , urine culture , and non-contrast CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis ) has been completed , patients who meet inclusion criteria will be asked whether they are willing to enroll in the study . Those who are unsuitable for the study or unwilling to participate will continue to receive routine care for their ureteral calculus . Those who consent will be enrolled as subjects in the study , and given a 2-week supply of either tamsulosin or silodosin in blinded bottles with the appropriate dosing instructions . The prescriptions will be dispensed by the pharmacy ; therefore the subjects and study staff will be blinded to which prescription the subject receives . Randomization will be done in advance and a key made to correlate subject enrollment number with which prescription they have received . Throughout the study , the study staff will make no efforts to ascertain which medication the subject has been given , unless an adverse event is suspected . Each participant will be given an information card that details the two possible medications they are taking , which can be presented to their physicians as needed . Subjects will then be discharged to home as per routine care with instructions to drink plenty of fluids , and will be given a strainer and asked to attempt to catch their ureteral calculus . They will also be given a standardized prescription analgesic package ( Percocet 5/325mg # 20 , Motrin 600mg # 60 , Zofran OD 4mg # 20 with standard dosing instructions ) and a Visual Analog Pain Scale diary to be filled out daily . Subjects will be given standardized discharge instructions as per standard of care that will include indications for immediate ED return for signs and symptoms of infection or MET failure ( fever , worsening pain , vomiting , lethargy , unsteadiness , syncope or inability to tolerate oral pain medications ) . As per standard of care , they will be instructed to return to the ER immediately if they develop any of these symptoms . Finally , the subject 's contact information will be collected at the time of enrollment and a follow-up appointment will be scheduled for them with Urology in 4 weeks to ensure they get appropriate and timely specialty follow-up . This follow-up is also standard of care , and will occur after the subject 's participation in the study ends . Each subject will be scheduled to return to the ER in 2 weeks to be seen by the research staff for data collection . They will be asked to bring their pill bottle and visual analog pain scale diary to this visit . If the subject reports having passed a stone consistent with their initial imaging , or have resolution of their pain to suggest they passed the stone unseen , this will conclude their participation in the study . However , if they are still having symptoms , their case will be categorized as an outpatient treatment failure and the subject will be registered to be seen by an ER Physician and a Urology consult will be ordered , concluding their participation in the study . This is current standard of care , and will be covered by insurance . Any subject that has an unscheduled visit to an ER for a ureterolithiasis-related complaint will also be considered an outpatient treatment failure . This will also conclude their participation in this study . To ensure follow-up , subjects will be called one week after enrollment . They will be reminded of their 2-week follow-up appointment and the need to bring in their pill bottles . Each subject will also be asked if they have passed the stone or had resolution of the pain . The will be reminded that they must follow-up even if they are no longer having symptoms .",2014-06-19,"June 19, 2020","Inclusion Criteria : Adults age 18 to 70 years Non-diabetic Unilateral ureteral calculus 4 to 10 mm visible on CT scan within the ureter Serum creatinine level within normal range Ability to tolerate oral fluids and oral pain medication Ability to make informed medical decisions regarding consent Willingness to follow up in the ER in two weeks Exclusion Criteria : Adults unable to consent Age 38º C or Urinalysis with any of the following : Positive Leukocyte Esterase , Positive Nitrates , or White Blood Cell Count > 5/hfp in the setting of a positive urine culture ( defined as a single isolated bacterial species population of > 100,000 CFU ) Patients with chronic pain already undergoing treatment with narcotic medications Patients already taking an alpha adrenergic antagonist medication Pregnant women Prisoners No working phone number",1,0,18 Years,70 Years

Imperial College London,NCT02221765,"Safety, Tolerability and Efficacy Study of PP1420 in HV",Imperial College London,1,0,Obesity,Drug,PP1420,Treatment,Double,"Obesity is a growing pandemic which affects 1 in 4 adults in the UK , and shortens life by increasing cardiovascular disease , diabetes and cancer . Current treatments for obesity have either poor efficacy or significant side effects . Pancreatic polypeptide ( PP ) is a promising new drug target as it produces powerful appetite suppression which , following a 90-minute infusion continues to act for 24 h in man . We have developed a new long lasting high potency analogue of PP , PP1420 . This is delivered as a once-a-day subcutaneous injection via a painless fine-gauge needle . In a first-time-in-man Phase 1a trial , that PP 1420 proved safe , well tolerated , and had extended pharmacokinetics compared to PP itself . We now plan to study the safety and PK of PP1420 up to 64mg . We will also assess : Its efficacy in reducing food intake after a single dose in a Phase 1B study in healthy volunteers . Its efficacy in reducing food intake and weight after multiple dosing in a Phase 1C study in healthy volunteers .","More than 25 % of people in the UK are obese . People with obesity have a shorter life expectancy , and have a higher risk of having heart attacks , strokes , high blood pressure , diabetes , and certain cancers . At the moment , there is no treatment for obesity that is both effective and safe . Advising people to change their diet and to exercise more is frequently ineffective , and any loss in weight seen is usually temporary . There is only one medications licensed for the purpose of losing weight , but they are limited by side-effects . Finally , gastric bypass and similar surgeries are effective at reducing weight permanently , but can be risky and restricted only to very motivated people . `` Gut hormones '' are natural chemicals made by the bowels when you eat . They work to reduce appetite and hunger when you eat , so that you will eat enough for your needs . We think that one of the reasons why gastric bypass surgery is so effective is because the surgery causes an increase in gut hormone secretion into the bloodstream , which suppresses appetite . One of these hormones is pancreatic polypeptide ( PP ) , which is released into the bloodstream by cells in the pancreas after eating . When human PP is given to healthy volunteers as an injection , we see that they have a reduced appetite and food intake with no side-effects such as feeling sick or vomiting . Human PP does not last long in the blood stream . In order to make it into a new , safe and effective drug for obesity , we have developed a new form of PP , which is very similar but not identical to human PP , that we expect will last longer in the blood . We call this PP 1420 . In testing , PP 1420 reduced food intake in animals , and was safe in them at much higher doses than those we plan to give in the current study . PP1420 has previously been give to healthy volunteers in single doses up to 8mg without any serious problems . All doses were well tolerated .

In RA , for some unknown reason , immune cells infiltrate into synovium of joint and produce the 'rheumatoid factor ' , prostaglandins , cytokines and other mediators . It damages joint and cartilage , even other organs . 80 % of the RA patients have Rheumatoid factor which is caused by high expression ratio of auto-antibodies in blood . Produced immune complexes , immune cells and antigen-presenting cells ( including macrophages , B cells , dendritic cells ) activate and release cytokines and then synovial tissue becomes thickened and damaged . It has been reported that synthetic DMARDs ( disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs ) including methotrexate ( MTX ) , sulfasalazine and biological DMARDs such as tumor necrosis factors ( TNF ) -α blockers , abatacept and rituximab , often in combination with MTX , are effective .

Researchers want to learn how to improve these transplantations . Objective : - To see if very low doses of Interleukin-2 after a partially matched transplantation prevent GVHD . Eligibility : Recipients : age 18 65 , with certain bone marrow or lymphatic system diseases and an available family member with partial tissue match . Donors : age 18 80 . Design : Recipients will be screened with medical history , physical exam , and many tests including blood and tissue tying . Donors will be screened with medical history , physical exam , blood tests and tissue typing . Recipients will stay in the hospital 3 6 weeks . All participants will have apheresis . Blood is drawn from one arm , run through a machine that collects white blood cells , then returned into the other arm . Recipients will have : Intravenous ( IV ) line placed under the skin and into a neck vein , to stay throughout transplant and recovery . They may also have a catheter inserted for collecting immune cells . Bone marrow sample taken by needle . They will have 3 more after transplant . Donors will have : Filgrastim injected once daily for 5 6 days . Stem and immune cells collected by another apheresis . Recipients will get : Eight 30-minute doses of radiation , sitting at a machine . Donor immune cells by IV , 6 days before the transplant day . Chemotherapy drugs by IV . - Donor stem cells by IV on transplant day . After transplant , recipients will give self-injections of very low doses of Interleukin-2 once daily for about 12 weeks . Before and after transplant , recipients will get medicine to suppress the immune system and antibiotics to prevent infections Recipients must stay near NIH for 3 6 months after transplant . All recipients and donors will have 3 years of follow-up .","Although allogeneic stem cell transplantation ( allo-SCT ) is a curative option for many hematologic malignancies , not all have a suitable donor . Haploidentical peripheral blood stem cell transplantation ( haplo-SCT ) has the advantage of immediate availability , higher stem cell dose , and feasibility of repeated cell collections for generating lymphocyte infusions to treat or prevent relapse or infection . However , haplo-SCT incurs a risk of bidirectional rejection with either severe graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) or graft rejection by the recipient . Therefore it is important to develop novel strategies to optimize the outcome of haplo-SCT . Designing a haplo-SCT that incorporates the concepts of modulating the immune system and allowing the opportunity for graft manipulation and/or adoptive immunotherapy may improve the treatment outcome . To achieve this , we are first interested in studying the immune modulatory effect of ultra-low dose Interleukin 2 ( ULD IL-2 ) as GVHD prophylaxis . This is an investigator initiated pilot study to determine the safety and feasibility of ULD IL-2 as GVHD prophylaxis in haploidentical allogeneic stem cell transplantation for patients with hematologic malignancies . Because GVHD has previously been associated with low numbers of circulating CD4+ CD25+FOXP3+ regulatory T cells ( T ( regs ) ) , research efforts in increasing T ( regs ) either ex-vivo with adoptive transfer of T ( regs ) or in vivo using immunomodulatory agents such as IL-2 , have shown promise in reducing incidences of GVHD . The primary objective of this study is to evaluate safety and feasibility . Secondary objectives are to determine the incidences of acute and chronic GVHD , engraftment , overall survival , transplant related mortality , and relapse . We will adopt the 2 step haplo-SCT method developed by Grosso et . al1 to study our method of GVHD prophylaxis . This 2 step approach , in which the lymphoid and myeloid portions of the graft are given in two separate steps in order to control and optimize T-cell , has already been published as a feasible and safe platform for haplo SCT for patients with hematologic malignancies and has been adopted by the Jefferson University Hospital ( PA , USA ) , where they continue to treat patients under this protocol . As an additional GVHD prophylaxis , we will use sirolimus , an previously established GVHD prophylaxis which may work with ULD IL-2 synergistically to increase T ( regs ) . The haploidentical donor will be mobilized by G-CSF and undergo one apheresis to collect lymphocytes and CD34+ stem cell product after Miltenyi CD34+ selection . The products will be cryopreserved until the time of transplantation . Recipients will receive a myeloablative conditioning regimen of fludarabine and total body irradiation ( TBI ) on days -10 to -6 . After the last fraction of TBI , a donor lymphocyte infusion ( DLI ) product ( 2 times 10 ( 8 ) CD3+/kg ) will be given . Cyclophosphamide will be given on days -3 and -2 , followed by CD 34+ selected donor stem cell product infused on day 0 . Sirolimus will be initiated on day -1 until day+60 . ULD-IL2 ( 100,000 IU/m2 ) will give subcutaneously daily for 12 weeks starting day +1 . This study will evaluate 14 recipients ( ages greater than or equal to 18 - less than or equal to 75 ; planned accrual up to 20 recipient in event of replacement ) with hematologic malignancies meeting indication for transplant but who do not have matched related or unrelated donor available . Safety will be monitored continuously with a stopping rule for toxicity based on the treatment-related serious adverse event rate ( TRSAE ) . Safety monitoring will continue until at least 114 days after transplantation , and recipients experiencing adverse events will be monitored until toxicity resolution or stabilization . Stopping rule is defined as nonrelapse mortality and steroid refractory GVHD during the period of safety monitoring for ULD IL-2 . Recipients will be followed for up to 1 year to evaluate the incidences of acute and chronic GVHD , engraftment , overall survival , transplant related mortality , and relapse .",2014-08-26,"July 3, 2018","INCLUSION CRITERIA RECIPIENT : Ages 18-70 years inclusive Haploidentical donor available Any one of the following hematologic conditions meeting a standard indication for allogeneic stem cell transplant : Chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML ) : Subjects under the age of 21 in chronic phase OR subjects ages 18-65 in chronic phase who have failed treatment with imatinib or have intolerance to imatinib OR Subjects ages 18-65 in accelerated phase or blast transformation .

Since the mechanical combination ( cardiopulmonary resuscitation with automated mechanical external chest compression and an impedance threshold device ) provides excellent perfusion pressure , the flow should be optimized pharmacological with vasodilation . The SNP reduces arterial vasoconstriction and enhances microcirculation . Furthermore , SNP significantly reduces vascular resistance and decreases cardiac ejection afterload . Therefore , SNPeCPR can significantly increase the flow of blood and optimize carotid and coronary flow . PROCEDURE During cardiac arrest resuscitation , patients will be included in the study after the investigator has verified the inclusion and non-inclusion criterion . A sealed box containing SNP or the placebo will then be open in the increasing numbers of randomization list . Whatever the allocated treatment ( nitroprusside or Placebo [ 5 % glucose solution ] ) , cardiopulmonary resuscitation protocol will be realize as recommended by the 2010 European Resuscitation Council and described as follows : cardiopulmonary resuscitation will be performed continuously without posing for control pulse until the first defibrillation attempt . As soon as possible manual CPR will be replace by automated mechanical external chest compression ( LUCAS® - Lund University Cardiopulmonary Assist System ) and an impedance threshold device ( ResQPOD® ) . placement of a peripheral intravenous ( IV ) or intraosseous ( IO ) line . This placement will be privileged to intubation , when the peripheral intravenous or intraosseous line is set , 1.96 mg sodium nitroprusside ( SNP ) / placebo will be injected , followed by injection of 10 ml saline for intravenous flush ( t = 0 minutes ) . 1 mg of epinephrine will be injected at t = 2 minutes , an external electric shock ( EEC ) will be realized at t = 3 minutes when the electric heart type allows it ( ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia ) , 0.98 mg sodium nitroprusside / placebo will be injected at t = 4 minutes , followed by an injection of 10 ml of saline for intravenous flush . 1 mg adrenaline will be injected at t = 7 minutes , the injection will be repeated every 5 minutes until return of spontaneous circulation or ending of the resuscitation decided by the emergency physician . an external electric shock ( EEC ) will be realized at t = 6 minutes when the electric heart type allows , then external shock will be repeated every 3 minutes until return of spontaneous circulation or ending of the resuscitation decided by the emergency physician . During that resuscitation the following parameters will be collected : The type of cardiac arrest ( place of cardiac arrest [ home , public place , stadium … ] , cardiac arrest before a witness or prompt rescue team , cardiac massage by the witness or prompt rescue team , durations between collapse and the start of resuscitation , non-specialized / specialized resuscitation , defibrillation shock by the witness or prompt rescue team ) , ETCO2 , blood pressure and SpO2 . the initial electrical rhythm ( defined by ECG ) by the mobile intensive care unit ( MICI ) and ECG 5 minutes after return of spontaneous circulation . arterial blood gas lactate troponin ( 24 hours after ROSC ) liver function ( 24 hours after ROSC ) creatinine ( 24 hours after ROSC ) echocardiography ( 4 and 24 hours after ROSC ) EXPECTED DURATION OF PARTICIPATION OF PEOPLE AND DESCRIPTION OF THE TIMING AND DURATION OF THE RESEARCH . Duration of intervention : 4 minutes Inclusion time : 30 months duration of participation ( + monitoring treatment ) : 6 months Total duration of the study : 3 years RANDOMIZATION Randomization will be realized by block and will be stratified by center . The boxes are numbered and contain drugs specified by the randomization arm . Randomization will be done by assigning at each inclusion a box taken in order of increasing numbers of the randomization list . The randomization list will be established under the responsibility of the clinical research unit . MONITORING COMMITTEE A monitoring committee will conduct an interim analysis after the inclusion of 50 % and 75 % of patients and will decide to stop or continue the study .",2014-08-25,"January 8, 2020","Inclusion Criteria : Patient with out of hospital cardiac arrest Age > 18 years and < 75 years Initial Rhythm : Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia or pulseless electrical activity Exclusion Criteria : out of hospital cardiac arrest of non-cardiac origin : trauma anoxic , including drowning hemorrhage , overdose ( drugs ) , drug , electric Do Not Resuscitate Order , obvious signs of clinical death ( decomposition , cadaveric rigidity , decapitation ) recent sternotomy ( < 6 months or recent scar ) Contraindications related to sodium nitroprusside Women of childbearing age ( between 18 and 55 years ) Other contra-indications will usually not known during resuscitation in case of presence of a relative rescue team must be searched : Hypothyroidism , Sulfuryl transferase deficiency ( rhodanese Lang ) currently recognized in patients with Leber optic atrophy , tobacco amblyopia or severe hepatic impairment .

Astellas Pharma Inc,NCT02220777,"A Study to Assess the Effects of Single Ascending Doses (SAD) of ASP8477, the Effect That Food Has on the Drug, and the Interaction Between ASP8477 and Omeprazole in Healthy Postmenopausal Females and Healthy Young Vasectomized Males",Astellas Pharma Europe B.V.,1,1,Pharmacokinetics of ASP8477,Drug,ASP8477,Basic Science,Double,"This is a 4-part study . Part I assesses the safety and tolerability of single ascending doses of ASP8477 or a placebo under fasted conditions in postmenopausal subjects . Part II is similar to part I except that the study is conducted in young , vasectomized males . Part III assesses the effect of food ( fed or fasted conditions ) on ASP8477 in postmenopausal subjects . Part IV assesses the drug-drug interaction between ASP8477 and omeprazole in postmenopausal subjects .","Part I ( SAD ) in healthy postmenopausal females evaluates the safety , and tolerability , and defines Maximum Tolerated Dose = MTD , pharmacokinetics , and pharmacodynamics of single ascending oral doses ( SAD ) of ASP8477 . It is anticipated that around 7 doses are required to cover the range from the safe starting dose until the MTD . Study medication is administered under fasted conditions . Based on the safety , PK , and clinical observation of the subjects , the dose escalation scheme may be adapted . Escalation to the next dose only proceeds after review of the safety , tolerability , and PK from the previous treatment period . Part II ( SAD in young , healthy , vasectomized males ) is similar to Part I , one cohort of 12 subjects are treated with two doses of ASP8477 plus placebo . The doses tested depend on the safety data and pharmacodynamic profiles obtained in Part I , but is not expected to exceed MTD . The rationale for this part is to bridge the data obtained in female subjects to male subjects . Part III ( food effect ) postmenopausal females receive ASP8477 once under fasted and once under fed conditions in two separate periods in random order . The dose does not exceed 1/3 of the MTD or , if that has not been reached , 1/3 of the highest tested dose in Part I . Subjects stay in the clinic for 2 periods of 5 to 7 days ( depending on the terminal half life , resulting from Part I ) . Subjects are admitted on Day -2 per treatment period . Subjects ' feeding status is the same as on Day 1 of the same treatment period . Subjects are given a single dose of ASP8477 under fed or fasting conditions on Day 1 . After final discharge , subjects return for an End of Study Visit ( ESV ) 5-9 days later . Part IV ( ASP8477-omeprazole drug-drug interaction ) postmenopausal subjects are randomized to receive omeprazole once alone and once with ASP8477 in two separate periods ( in random order ) . The dose of ASP8477 is the MTD or , if that is not been reached , the highest tested dose in Part I. Omeprazole is chosen as target drug as it is a model substrate for CYP2C19 ( accepted by FDA ) and ASP8477 is known to have the strongest inhibitory effect on CYP2C19 . Subjects are admitted on Day -1 and stay for 2 periods of 4 days . Subjects are given a single dose of omeprazole alone or with ASP8477 ( in randomized order ) on Day 1 .

Loewenstein Hospital,NCT02227056,Effect of Methylphenidate on Ecologic Function in Paediatric Acquired Brain Injury Population,Loewenstein Hospital,2,1,Acquired Brain Injury,Drug,Methylphenidate,Treatment,Single,"The purpose of this study is to investigate the influence of Methylphenidate in pediatric acquired brain injury population , regarding ecologic ( every day ) function . It is hypothesized that the function with treatment will improve when compared to function without treatment in the same patient . Improvement is expected by shortening time of execution in each specific task and by reduction of the amount of assistance needed .","Attention deficits in patients with acquired brain injury ( ABI ) are one of the most common cognitive disorders acquainted . Prevalence of attention deficits after cerebrovascular accident ( CVA ) varies between 20-58 % , and after traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) may range up to 60 % Methylphenidate ( MPH ) is a central nervous system ( CNS ) stimulant . In the CNS it increases release and blocks reuptake of dopamine and noradrenalin , resulting in increased synaptic and extracellular concentrations . Methylphenidate ( MPH ) , act at the D1 and α2-adrenergic receptors to facilitate effects on prefrontal cortical modulation of attention and working memory .Methylphenidate has been used effectively and safely for treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder for many decades . The use of Methylphenidate to enhance attention in disorders following TBI has been proposed as `` rational pharmacotherapy '' . It demonstrated improvement in response speed , in adult patients with chronic TBI . In pediatric population suffering Acquired brain injury there are scarce works regarding methylphenidate short or long term efficacy . Since there are scarce reports altogether on Methylphenidate 's effect in pediatric Acquired brain injury population and since the studies up to now examined the effectiveness in neuropsychological batteries we find it of interest to examine the effect of Methylphenidate in ecological tasks , thus achieving a better understanding of its possible effect in this subpopulation . STUDY ASSUMPTIONS : Methylphenidate has a proved safety profile in pediatric population suffering from primary attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or secondary attention deficit hyperactivity disorder . Methylphenidate has positive influence on attentional disorders in pediatric population suffering from Acquired brain injury in subacute and chronic phases . Methylphenidate can enhance function of children with attentional disturbances secondary to Acquired brain injury in different everyday tasks . Methylphenidate can improve learning in pediatric population suffering from secondary attention deficit hyperactivity disorder after Acquired brain injury , during subacute rehabilitation period . STUDY POPULATION : The study is designed to include up to 40 children , aged 4-18 years , suffering attentional disturbances secondary to Acquired Brain Injury ( CVA , TBI , Anoxic brain injury , Central Nervous System infections ) . Participants will be children hospitalized ( inpatient or outpatient ) for rehabilitation in Loewenstein Rehabilitation Center Hospital , with no contraindications for Methylphenidate treatment after their legal guardian gave informed consent for participation . STUDY METHODS : Before inclusion each participant will undergo : ECG A screened computed exam to prove attentional disturbances with the Test of Variables of Attention ( TOVA ) test . Each participant will be tested on each task twice in two week 's period : twice without treatment of Methylphenidate and twice with Methylphenidate treatment . Some participants will be retested after 7-14 days with no further treatment with Methylphenidate , in order to estimate if influence of the drug on function continues with no further treatment . Drug will be given at least an hour and not more than 2.5 hours before being tested . Drug dosage 0.3 milligram/kilo rounded to the nearest full milligram dosage will be given a total of 3 times : once before Test of Variables of Attention ( TOVA ) exam under Methylphenidate , and two other days while the participant is tested on the different tasks . Testing will be done in two hours of treatment session on different days . Each participant will undergo the following tasks , in a consecutive order : Dressing -T-shirt .

Karolinska Institutet,NCT02207985,Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation in Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma,Karolinska Institutet,1,0,Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma,Procedure,Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation,Treatment,,"Aim : To study the antitumour effect of reduced intensity conditioning ( RIC ) with allogeneic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma after radical resection of the tumour and adjuvant treatment with standard chemotherapy . Importance : If investigators can accomplish an anti-tumour effect using RIC with HSCT as adjuvant treatment in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma , it might increase the survival or even cure patients in this group with very poor prognosis . Primary scientific question : Can investigators demonstrate an anti-tumour effect against pancreatic adenocarcinoma using adjuvant treatment with HSCT ? Can investigators demonstrate an anti-tumour effect against pancreatic adenocarcinoma using adjuvant treatment with HSCT ?","Background Cancer of the pancreas is one of the most common cancer forms in Sweden . Nine-hundred persons receive this diagnosis every year . The 5-year survival is very low , between 5 and 15 % , even in the cases where radical resection of the tumor can be performed . This is probably due to minimal residual disease that can not be diagnosed at the time of surgery . It has recently been shown that micrometastases of pancreatic adenocarcinoma can be detected in tissue samples from lymph nodes and bone marrow , using new sensitive immunohistological methods . When radical resection of the tumour is performed , no microscopically visible tumour is left , but even in this situation , local recurrence of the disease is the most common cause of death in these patients . None of the so far studied adjuvant treatments , irradiation or chemotherapy , has substantially improved the survival in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma . Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) is an established curative treatment for malignant blood diseases , mainly leukemia . Using the conventional form of HSCT , where the patient undergoes a myeloablative conditioning with chemotherapy and irradiation , will diminish the amount of malignant cells , but also create space in the bone marrow for the donated stem cells . The myeloablative conditioning induces severe toxic effects , but the patient is rescued by the transplantation of the donated hematopoietic stem cells . The new stem cells will mature into an immune system that will react with the patient 's cells , an effect called graft-versus-host reaction ( GVHD ) . It has been shown that the graft-versus-host reaction correlates well with the curative anti-tumor effect . A mild GVH reaction will diminish the risk of relapse , while a severe GVH reaction might be mortal . This anti-tumour effect is mediated by white blood cells of the T-cell type . From this knowledge , the HSCT technique has been developed and nowadays it is possible to use reduced intensity conditioning ( RIC ) . With reduced intensity conditioning using milder forms of chemotherapy , the toxic effects can be reduced , but the immunosuppressive effect is enough to make sure that the hematopoietic stem cells will engraft . Using RIC has lead to treatment of older patients and the anti-tumor effect is just as efficient as with the myeloablative conditioning . Recently , RIC with HSCT has been used as adjuvant treatment against solid tumours , mainly kidney cancer , colon cancer and breast cancer . An important part of the treatment consists of additional infusion of donor lymphocyte infusions ( DLI ) after the transplantation to maintain or increase the anti-tumour effect . At our clinic , we have treated about 50 patients with solid tumours using RIC with HSCT . Most of our patients had kidney or colon cancer ( 19 and 16 patients , respectively ) , but also two patients with prostate cancer have been treated . About ten patients with primary liver cancers have been treated with liver transplantation combined with RIC with HSCT . The transplantation-related mortality in these patients is about 10-15 % . Aim : To study the antitumour effect of RIC with HSCT in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma after radical resection of the tumour and adjuvant treatment with standard chemotherapy . Importance : If investigators can accomplish an anti-tumour effect using RIC with HSCT as adjuvant treatment in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma , it might increase the survival or even cure patients in this group with very poor prognosis . Primary scientific question : Can investigators demonstrate an anti-tumour effect against pancreatic adenocarcinoma using adjuvant treatment with HSCT ? Secondary scientific questions : What side-effects will the patient suffer ? Can survival be improved compared to standard treatment of pancreatic adenocarcinoma ? Is it possible to improve the results by using cytotoxic T-cells against specific pancreatic adenocarcinoma antigens ? Are there methods to identify the patients that will have the best results from the treatment ? How will quality of life be affected ? Study plan : The aim of the study is to evaluate the anti-tumour effect of treatment with RIC with HSCT in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma . All patients will undergo curative surgery with radical resection of the tumour and adjuvant standard chemotherapy with gemcitabine . HSCT will be offered to patients with an HLA-identical sibling , a kind of biological randomisation . The control group will consist of patients without an HLA-identical sibling , or those declining HSCT . Inclusion criteria : Patients with radically resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma that have received adjuvant treatment with standard chemotherapy after surgery . Exclusion criteria : Pancreatic adenocarcinoma with metastases or non-radical resection of the tumour . Relapse during standard chemotherapy . Age above 70 years . Severe heart conditions , liver disease , impaired kidney function or other organ dysfunction that will result in severe toxic effects of the HSCT treatment . Group A will undergo radical resection of the tumour and standard chemotherapy . About eight months after surgery , they will undergo conditioning with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine before transplantation of donated hematopoietic stem cells from their HLA-identical sibling donors . The immunosuppressive treatment , which is given to diminish GVHD , will be tapered quickly to make sure that the anti-tumour effect is as efficient and as fast as possible . Further infusion of DLI will be given to increase or maintain anti-tumour effect in the cases where the graft-versus-host reaction is missing or is very mild . The first DLI will be given intravenously and the second one will be given in A. hepatica to induce a better local effect , since metastases to the liver is a very common event . Conditioning and HSCT will be performed at Centre for Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation and that is also where the follow-up of the patients will be performed . The surgical follow-up will be at the surgical department . Group B will be treated with standard chemotherapy according to current protocols at the department of oncology . The clinical and laboratory parameters that will be registered are : Mortality Morbidity Time to relapse , will be controled with CT scans Quality of life Tumour markers Detection of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes that have the ability to react with pancreactic adenocarcinoma from the patient as well as cell lines in vitro Detection of micrometastases in bone marrow .",2014-06-18,"July 4, 2023","Inclusion Criteria : Patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma who have undergone curative surgery ad modum Whipple with radical resection of the tumor , R0 or R1 .

Snapper, MD PHD",1,1,Ulcerative Colitis,Drug,Interleukin-2 (aldesleukin).,Treatment,,The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and maximum effective dose ( MED ) of Interleukin-2 in subjects with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis .,"Interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) is a T cell growth factor . IL-2 is currently licensed for the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma and metastatic melanoma , where it promotes the expansion of anti-cancer cytotoxic T cells and natural killer ( NK ) cells . However at low doses ( 100-times lower than those used in cancer therapy ) , IL-2 promotes the selective expansion of regulatory T cells ( Tregs ) : an immune modulating subset of CD4+ lymphocytes . A recent phase 1 clinical trial from our collaborators at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute showed that low-dose IL-2 selectively expands Tregs in patients with treatment-resistant Graft vs . Host Disease ( GvHD ) , and that low-dose IL-2 is safe in this condition . A detailed immunological analysis of samples from this study showed that low-dose IL-2 treatment was associated with increased Treg proliferation , increased de novo thymic generation of Tregs , and a resolution of defects in intracellular signalling and apoptosis seen in Tregs in chronic GvHD . A recent phase 1 study from another group showed that low-dose IL-2 is safe in the treatment of HCV-associated vasculitis . Low-dose IL-2 has also been shown to be well-tolerated in subjects with HIV . Ulcerative colitis ( UC ) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the colon . Evidence from pre-clinical models of intestinal inflammation , and also from patients with monogenetic defects in Treg function , suggests that Tregs play a role in the prevention of inflammation in the intestine . The treatment ( or intervention ) in this study is a once-daily , subcutaneous injection of IL-2 , for a total of 8 weeks . The first 2 doses of the study drug will be administered by research nurses at Boston Children 's Hospital . Further doses will be self-administered , at home . Training will be provided for correct self-administration . This is a 3+3 dose escalation study of IL-2 in moderate-to-severe UC . This study design is powered to identify the MED of low-dose IL-2 in UC . Once the MED is identified , a further 10 subjects will receive IL-2 at that dose . Recruitment of between 2 and 28 patients is planned . The maximum tolerated dose ( MED ) is the highest tolerated dose level at which a minimum of 6 subjects have been evaluated , with fewer than 2 evaluable subjects in 6 experiencing a dose limiting toxicity ( DLT ) ; i.e . DLT in > 1/6 evaluable subjects . In addition to the above at least 1 patient should meet the criteria for response or remission for it to be considered the MED . Dose levels are based on the experience of our collaborators in GvHD . In addition to determining the MED , this study will determine if low-dose IL-2 is safe and well-tolerated in patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis . A detailed immunological analysis of samples obtained from this study will determine if low-dose IL-2 expands Tregs in vivo , in patients with moderate-to-severe UC . Immunological changes will then be correlated with clinical response . The study will take place at Boston Children 's Hospital . The study will involve 10 study visits . Most of the study visits involve blood tests . A flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy will be performed as part of the screening process . A flexible sigmoidoscopy will also be performed on completion of therapy , to determine clinical response . The first two subjects to receive the study drug will be admitted overnight following the first dose . Subsequent doses will be administered on an out-patient basis .

University of Pittsburgh,NCT02201563,Minocycline Therapy for Management of Adverse Radiation Effects,University of Pittsburgh,1,0,Irradiation; Adverse Effect,Drug,Minocycline,Treatment,,"Stereotactic radiosurgery ( SRS ) is a well-established treatment for patients with metastatic brain tumors . Although SRS has a very high tumor growth control these interventions are associated with adverse radiation effects ( ARE ) in approximately 15 % of patients . The traditional approach , and still a mainstay , is the administration of a course of high dose anti-inflammatory corticosteroids . Currently there are no other effective oral neuroprotective agents in clinical practice which can improve outcomes of patients with ARE after radiosurgery for brain metastases . Minocycline , an antibiotic with a favorable adverse effect profile and pharmacokinetics , has been shown to have neuroprotective properties in experimental models of a variety of neurological diseases , as well as in human clinical trials . The investigators propose a single arm clinical trial , to evaluate the safety and feasibility of minocycline in improving ARE . This study will recruit 15 patients who will be treated with minocycline ( 100mg BID ) for 3 months . This clinical trial has the potential to prove that minocycline therapy is safe in this patient population . In addition , positive results will provide preliminary evidence for its use in an array of radiosurgical indications .","Although stereotactic radiosurgery ( SRS ) has proven to be highly effective in the management of brain metastases , it is not without risk . Despite selective targeting of lesions and the sharp dose fall-off associated with radiosurgical treatments , adverse radiation effects ( AREs ) can occur in 10-15 % of patients . Adverse radiation effects ( AREs ) can be defined as unexpected or undesirable post-radiosurgery imaging change regardless of whether it is clinically symptomatic . Patients showing ARE have limited therapeutic options with corticosteroids being the main treatment modality . This single arm clinical trial , will evaluate the safety and feasibility of minocycline in improving AREs . Brain metastases patients with documented AREs will be treated with minocycline ( 100 mg twice a day ) for 3 months in addition to the standard treatment with oral corticosteroids . The investigators anticipate recruiting a total of 15 patients over 12 months . Primary aim : The primary aim is of this study to evaluate safety and feasibility of minocycline therapy in patients with ARE after radiosurgery . The investigators ' hypothesis is that minocycline will be safe in this patient population . Safety will be assessed by monitoring blood levels of drug , liver enzymes , renal function tests , and monitoring for major and minor side-effects . Research Strategy The investigators plan to conduct a single arm observational study to evaluate safety and feasibility of minocycline in patients diagnosed with radiosurgery associated adverse radiation effects . In addition to clinical and biochemical monitoring for safety , the investigators will also employ neuroimaging techniques to investigate whether minocycline reduces enhancement at lesion in post contrast T1 weighted MRI and reduces hyper intensity surrounding the tumor as detected by T2 MRI radiosurgery . Primary Outcomes : 1 ) The primary clinical outcome will be safety of minocycline use in this patient population . Secondary outcomes : 1 ) The investigators will also review brain images in detail to find any evidence of benefit from Minocycline therapy such as reduction or resolution of volume of T2 hyper intensity and contrast enhancement at the lesion ( radiation necrosis ) at 4-6 weeks and 3 month follow-up . 2 ) Overall neurological status 3 ) Change in neurocognitive status , 4 ) Reduction in the number of patients needing resection 5 ) Changes in plasma biomarkers , and plasma drug levels . Target Population : Recruitment will take place at Center of Image-guided Neurosurgery of UPMC . All patients with AREs after brain metastases radiosurgery will be potentially eligible for the study . The investigators anticipate enrolling 15 patients . Patients will be diagnosed based on MRI findings . The investigators will evaluate T1 pre and post contrast , T2 , FLAIR and Perfusion MR in order to diagnose ARE . MR spectroscopy or CT Pet will be obtained when clinically indicated . The investigators will use T1/T2 matching and proportion of edema versus lesion volume as a guide for diagnosing ARE .",2014-07-24,"June 20, 2018","Inclusion Criteria : Age range : 18 - 90 years Males and females .

University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center,NCT02201355,Hypofractionated Reduced-Volume Chemoradiation for T1/2N0-2 SCC Head and Neck,University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center,1,0,Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck T1/2N0-2,Radiation,Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy,Treatment,,"Primary Objectives : To determine whether patients with T1/2N0-2 Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the oropharynx , hypopharynx or larynx can tolerate treatment with cisplatin chemoradiation in three weeks using reduced volume IMRT Secondary Objectives : To describe the adverse events associated with hypofractionated , reduced volume cisplatin chemoradiation . To estimate response rates and progression-free survival rates of hypofractionated , reduced volume cisplatin chemoradiation . To determine HRQOL following hypofractionated , reduced volume cisplatin chemoradiation . If patients can safely be treated in three weeks rather than six weeks , such a schedule would provide a much more convenient alternative for patients and result in a significant reduction in the health care resources currently expended on cure of these patients .","Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas ( HNSCC ) are frequently occurring tumors with more than 500,000 new cases worldwide and 45,000 in the USA yearly . Most patients present with local-regionally advanced diseases . Chemotherapy given concurrently with radiation is an integrated treatment component in the management of these patients . Concurrent chemoradiation can be given in unresectable diseases , in organ preservation to avoid surgery and preserve functions , and in high risk patients after surgery . Randomized clinical trials and meta-analyses have shown that concurrent chemoradiation are superior to radiation alone in these settings . One way of reducing overall treatment time and toxicity is to reduce the number of fractions by increasing the daily radiotherapy dose . The consequence of increased daily dose is both an increase in acute side effects as well as an increase in late toxicity . A widely accepted model of these radiobiologic effects over the range of typical 2-4 Gy daily fractions is the alpha-beta model that distinguishes acute responses and late responses based on a linear-quadratic fitting of extrapolated clonogenic survival curves . A time factor can be incorporated to account for the effect of repopulation . Equivalent biologically effective dose schedules using a reduced number of fractions may be calculated for any conventionally fractionated course . Because 70Gy/35/6 weeks with chemoradiation has been demonstrated to be tolerable , and because 66Gy/30/6 weeks has been shown with IMRT to produce 90 % control for T1/2 oropharyngeal primary tumors , we will take the biological equivalent of 66Gy/33 fractions over six weeks as the biologic equivalent standard we wish to maintain in hypofractionated courses of radiation . Because 54Gy/30 over six weeks is a well-known elective radiation dose schedule producing 95 % control of occult nodal disease , we will take this as the biologically equivalent standard we wish to maintain in our hypofractionated schedules .",2014-07-23,"January 28, 2021","Inclusion Criteria : T1/2N0-2M0 SCC of the oropharynx , hypopharynx or larynx Age ≥ 18 years .

Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center,NCT02203019,Study of Sedative Medications in Patients With Severe Infection and Respiratory Failure,Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center,4,1,Sepsis,Drug,Propofol,Treatment,,"Patients with infections in their blood often become very sick . These patients are usually put in an intensive care unit for careful observation and treatment . These patients may develop a low blood pressure , lung failure , and kidney failure . When these problems develop , care becomes quite complicated . Patients with lung failure often need help with a breathing machine to make certain that the breathing is adequate . The machine helps keep the oxygen level high enough for healthy tissues . When patients are placed on the machine for breathing they require a tube to be placed into lungs . This can be quite uncomfortable . These patients need sedation to help them tolerate the uncomfortable breathing tube and other parts of their routine necessary care . This study will compare two drugs ( dexmedetomidine and propofol ) which are frequently used for sedation in intensive care patients . Clinical studies suggest that these drugs are both effective and safe . The main question is whether or not one of the drugs is better in a patient with a blood infection . This study will try to determine that . Our main goal is to see whether or not patients on one particular drug come off the breathing machine faster than patients on the other drug . These drugs are not experimental drugs and are approved by the Food and Drug Administration . There is no placebo drug being used in this study . All patients in this study will receive the best possible care based on their medical condition .","Patients admitted to the MICU with acute respiratory care and possible sepsis will be evaluated and managed by the internal medicine MICU team . This team includes faculty members , pulmonary fellows , and internal medicine residents . These physicians will make all the decisions regarding the initial management of the patient . The admitting team will be approached by the study investigators to solicit their support for the recruitment of the patient into the study . During some periods of time the study investigators will be directly involved in the patient care . The general approach to managing patients with sepsis includes blood cultures , serum lactate levels , and empiric antibiotics . Other cultures from the respiratory tract , urinary tract , and other sites are also obtained as indicated . Empiric antibiotic choices will be based on the most likely source of infection . Patient will receive fluid administration and vasopressors to maintain mean arterial pressure blood pressures greater than or equal to 60 mmHg . Mechanical ventilation support will follow ARDS network guidelines . In general patients will be on an assist-control mode , a low tidal volume ( 6 mm/kg ideal body weight ) , and a FiO2 adequate to maintain O2 saturations greater than equal to 90 % . PEEP levels will be based on the FiO2 using ARDS network recommendations . The ventilator management goal is to have the lowest possible plateau pressure and lowest FiO2 possible to maintain adequate ventilation and oxygenation . Fentanyl will be routinely ordered for analgesia . Per current UMC policy , initial fentanyl boluses will be given at 50mcg IV every 2 hours as needed to keep pain level less than 4/10 . At the discretion of the provider , a fentanyl drip may be administered if intermittent fentanyl does not achieve adequate analgesia . If a fentanyl drip is initiated , the drip will have a range of 25-200 mcg/hour to achieve a pain level of less than 4/10 . If an allergy to fentanyl is documented , the patient will be excluded from the study . Once a mechanically ventilated patient with sepsis is selected for enrollment , the patient will be randomized ( via a computer-generated randomization program ) to one of two sedation arms : 1 ) propofol , or 2 ) dexmedetomidine . Per current UMC policy , propofol will be initiated at 5 mcg/kg/minute ( 0.3mg/kg/hour ) and titrated every 5 minutes by 5mcg/kg/minute to RASS ( Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale ) goal -1 to +1 . The maximum dose of propofol will be 80 mcg/kg/minute . Dexmedetomidine will be initiated at 0.2 mcg/kg/hour and will be titrated every 5 minutes by 0.1mcg/kg/hour to a maximum dose of 1.4 mcg/kg/hour to a RASS goal of -1 to +1 . Although dexmedetomidine has only been approved in the United States for short-term sedation of ICU patients ( < 24 hrs ) at a maximal dose of 0.7 μg/kg/hr ( up to 1.0 μg/kg/h for procedural sedation ) , several studies demonstrate the safety and efficacy of dexmedetomidine infusions administered for greater than 24 hrs ( up to 28 days ) and at higher doses ( up to 1.5 μg/kg/hr ) . Daily sedation stops will be performed in both study arms per MICU weaning policy . Patients will be allowed to return to a RASS of 0 to +1 , and the physician will be alerted for assessment . If the physician determines sedation needs to be re-started , it will be at 50 % of the dose prior to the sedation stop . This dose will then be titrated to a RASS goal of -1 to +1 .

Effects of haloperidol vs. placebo will reveal the role of D2 and the effects of fluphenazine vs. haloperidol will reveal the role of D1 in this process . OBJECTIVE : This study will begin to define the neurochemistry of Pathological Gambling by examining the roles of dopamine D1 and D2 receptors in gambling reinforcement and psychostimulant reinforcement , and exploring genetic predictors of response to DA probes in Pathological Gambling subjects ( subjects ) and healthy controls . METHODS : A double-blind , placebo controlled , counterbalanced between-within design will be employed . Each participant will attend 4 sessions with a minimum of 1 week between sessions to ensure drug washout . Responses to the slot machine will be assessed in sessions 1 and 2 ( Phase I ) , and responses to amphetamine will be assessed in sessions 3 and 4 ( Phase II ) . A second capsule ( dummy ) will be administered at expected peak levels for each antagonist on sessions 1 and 2 to standardize the procedure across sessions . Subjective reinforcement self-report scales will be administered at key intervals throughout the study . HYPOTHESIS : It is hypothesized that haloperidol ( 3-mg ) will increase priming ( Desire to Gamble , Gambling word salience ) and pleasurable effects ( e.g. , Enjoyment/Liking ) induced by playing a slot machine in Pathological Gambling subjects ( N = 40 ) . If gambling and stimulant reinforcement are mediated by common mechanisms , haloperidol will also increase priming and pleasurable effects of amphetamine ( 20-mg ) in Pathological Gambling subjects . If D1 mediates effects of haloperidol , the mixed D1-D2 antagonist , fluphenazine ( fluphenazine ; 3-mg ) will decrease or not alter responses to the slot machine and amphetamine in Pathological Gambling subjects . If D2 deficits are linked with gambling pathology , haloperidol will not affect slot machine or amphetamine reinforcement in controls ( N= 40 ) . If D1 deficits are linked with gambling pathology , fluphenazine will increase gambling and amphetamine reinforcement in controls , by mitigating undue D1 activation in subjects with high baseline D1 function . If D1 or D2 genes contribute to gambling or amphetamine reinforcement , genotype will predict responses to the manipulations .",2014-07-23,"April 11, 2016","Inclusion Criteria : PATHOLOGICAL GAMBLERS otherwise healthy , non-treatment seeking , non-abstinent male or female ages 19-65 DSM-IV PG symptom scale score > 5 SOGS ( South Oaks Gambling Screen ) score > 5 nicotine dependence acceptable CONTROLS healthy male or female ages 19-65 DSM-IV PG symptom scale score = 0 SOGS score = 0 nicotine dependence acceptable must have played slot machine > 5 times Exclusion Criteria : both Pathological Gamblers and Controls Axis I psychopathology aside from nicotine dependence ( or PG ) based on SCID Schizotypal or Borderline Personality Disorder based on psychiatric interview Family history of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder English comprehension below grade 7 level .

It remains unclear how and for whom ABMT is effective , limiting clinical translation . The proposed research involves an RCT using a highly sensitive measure of neurocognitive functioning , scalp-recorded event-related potentials ( ERPs ) , to delineate key mechanisms of an emerging treatment for anxiety . Researchers will recruit 90 anxious participants to engage in the study and pursue the following three specific aims : Aim 1 will examine relations between neural and behavioral responses to threat prior to ABMT . Aim 2 will examine the effects of ABMT on ERPs to threat , threat bias , and anxiety . Aim 3 will examine relations between ERP responses to threat and reductions in threat bias and anxiety . Researchers will test whether post-training neural changes , specified in Aim 2 , are associated with reductions in behavioral threat bias and anxiety severity . Researchers will also explore whether ERP measures of greater attention capture and/or reduced control of attention to threat at baseline predict treatment response , helping identify which patients will benefit most from ABMT . Through the innovative combination of a highly sensitive neurocognitive measure and an RCT design , this study aims to delineate core neurocognitive responses to threat as mechanisms in the remediation of anxiety . Confirmation of study hypotheses would , ultimately , accelerate the pace of development of more biologically-informed , accessible , and targeted interventions for anxiety .","Anxiety disorders are the most common psychiatric diagnosis , affecting as many as 29 % of people during their lifetime . In addition to the devastating personal cost of anxiety , the yearly economic cost to society has been estimated to be around $ 46.6 billion in the U.S. Empirically-based treatments for anxiety have improved in recent years , but barriers to access , side effects , and high remission rates ( ~50 % ) suggest the need for complementary treatments . Computer-based attention bias modification treatment ( ABMT ) , which is brief , cost-effective , and easy to administer , targets a key mechanism in pathological anxiety - the threat bias , or exaggerated attention feared or threatening stimuli . Two decades of research show that reducing threat bias via computerized ABMT also reduces anxiety severity at levels comparable to gold-standard treatments . Despite its promise , no randomized clinical trials ( RCTs ) have evaluated specific mechanisms underlying ABMT 's effects on anxiety , nor identified predictors of treatment response . Therefore , it remains unclear how and for whom ABMT is effective , limiting clinical translation . This study is a randomized clinical trial using a highly sensitive measure of neurocognitive functioning to delineate key mechanisms of an emerging treatment for anxiety . Specifically , the study will use scalp-recorded event-related potentials ( ERPs ) to elucidate neurocognitive processes implicated in attention bias modification treatment ( ABMT ) and to predict treatment response . Researchers will recruit 90 anxious patients to engage in the study and pursue the following three specific aims : Aim 1 will examine relations between neural and behavioral responses to threat prior to ABMT . Researchers will test whether greater behavioral threat bias is associated with ERP responses indicating greater attention capture by threat ( larger P1 and P2 ERPs ) , and reduced top-down control of attention to threat ( smaller N2 , N2pc , P3 ERPs ) . Aim 2 will examine the effects of ABMT on ERPs to threat , threat bias , and anxiety . Analyses will focus on whether ABMT relative to placebo training will result in greater reductions in automatic attention capture and/or controlled attention to threat measured via ERPs . Aim 3 will examine relations between ERP responses to threat and reductions in threat bias and anxiety . Researchers will test whether post-training neural changes , specified in Aim 2 , will be associated with reductions in behavioral threat bias and anxiety severity . These predicted relations , together with those tested in Aim 2a , support the utility of these ERPs as neural markers for the specific cognitive processes underlying ABMT efficacy . Researchers will also explore whether ERP measures of greater attention capture and/or reduced control of attention to threat at baseline predict treatment response , helping identify which patients will benefit most from ABMT .

Lupus has no cure , and up to 90 % of patients require corticosteroids for disease control . More than half of patients with lupus have permanent organ damage , much of which is either directly due to or increased by corticosteroids . To satisfactorily manage moderate-to-severe SLE , the investigators need effective treatments that will allow corticosteroid-sparing . High-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous BMT or peripheral blood progenitor transplantation ( PBSCT ) has been proposed as a novel approach to treat severe autoimmune diseases . Allogeneic BMT is not currently utilized for the routine treatment of SLE because of the significant morbidity ( GVHD ) and mortality associated with the procedure . The investigators have recently developed an approach to BMT using post-transplant cyclophosphamide that allows us to safely perform allogeneic BMT from matched , mismatched , unrelated or haploidentical donors . Transplant-related mortality , graft-failure and risk of GVHD have been very low with this approach . Furthermore , this approach allows us to greatly expand the donor pool since any patient shares exactly one HLA haplotype with each biological parent or child and half of siblings , an eligible haploidentical donor can be identified rapidly in nearly all cases . This trial will employ a fludarabine + cyclophosphamide conditioning along with posttransplantation cyclophosphamide on for patients with refractory SLE .

Mustafa Kemal University,NCT02086747,Acetaminophen for Chronic Pain in Hysterectomy,Mustafa Kemal University,4,1,Abdominal Hysterectomy (& Wertheim),Drug,Acetaminophen,Treatment,Double,The investigators hypothesized that 1 mg of acetaminophen 4 times per day for 3 days prevent chronic pain in hysterectomy patients .,"The most appropriate expression of the pain is `` an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage , or described in terms of such damage '' ( IASP,2008 ) ( 1 ) . When pain lasts longer than 3 months or beyond the time when an acute injury would be expected to have healed , the patient 's presentation becomes more complex , often , not surprisingly , with more psychological features . These include complaints of poor or non-refreshing sleep , tiredness , depression and poor concentration . Pain at this stage is often said to be `` chronic '' ( 2 ) . Chronic pain is not only a common problem but also a significant and increasing public health burden in virtually all developed countries ( 3 ) . Hysterectomy is one of the most common surgical procedures in women . Recent studies have recognized that there is a 20-40 % incidence of chronic post-surgical pain after hysterectomy surgery ( 4 ) ( 5 ) ( 6 ) . Effective pain management is an important component of postsurgical care . Many patients , however , continue to experience inadequate pain relief ( 7 ) Despite all analgesic strategies , in the postoperative periods 80 % of patients still suffer from moderate to severe pain ( 8 ) . The ideal analgesic has some properties like rapid and effective pain relief , minimal adverse effects , and minimal impact on major organ systems or no interaction with other pharmacologic agents . Opioids are still good choice for postoperative pain but has dose dependent adverse effects and negative postoperative outcomes ( 9 ) ( 10 ) . Nonopioid analgesics are commonly used alone or as adjuncts to opioid-based analgesia to treat moderate to severe pain . Perioperative administration of acetaminophen with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) has been advocated to provide `` multimodal '' or `` balanced '' analgesia that decreases opioid dose requirements and may reduce associated adverse events while reducing postsurgical pain intensity ( 9 ) ( 11 ) . Acetaminophen is superior to the other analgesics because of safety and analgesic profile . At the same time it has less contraindications and drug interactions with the others . Acetaminophen act by selectively inhibiting the release of prostaglandins within the central nervous system as well as having some peripheral analgesic effect ( 12 ) . Rarely overdose use can induce hepatoxicity ( 13 ) . While providing fast and significant pain relief as well as a significant morphine-sparing effect , ( 14 ) ( 15 ) . it is not associated with the increased incidence of nausea , vomiting , and respiratory depression observed with opioids or the deleterious gastrointestinal , hematologic , and renal effects associated with NSAIDs and cyclooxygenase ( COX ) -2 inhibitors ( 16 ) . Several international guidelines ( EULAR , ACR ) and influential reviews recommend the use of paracetamol as the first-line analgesic of choice for the management of chronic pain , as it provides cost-effective analgesia without the risks associated with NSAID use , particularly in the elderly . Based on currently available data , the use of alternative analgesics , such as tramadol and opioids , either alone or in combination with paracetamol , is warranted in those patients whose pain does not respond to nonnarcotic analgesics . While these recommendations are based on a vast amount of clinical data , they do not account for individual patient responses ( 17 ) . Paracetamol is rapidly absorbed from immediaterelease formulations , with maximum concentrations in plasma typically occurring between 0.25 and 2.0 hours , and an onset of action within about 30 minutes ( 18 ) . Because the terminal elimination phase half-life of paracetamol in plasma is short , in the region of 1.9-2.5 hours after a therapeutic dose , ( 19 ) the recommended time between doses is 4-6 hours , resulting in a 4-times daily dosing schedule . The investigators hypothesised that postoperative treatment with paracetamol with repeated doses of 1 g in comparison of placebo in hysterectomy patients with moderate or severe pain would decrease analgesics consumption perioperatively and the incidence of chronic pain associated with abdominal hysterectomy .",2014-02-07,"March 12, 2015","Inclusion Criteria : Patients 18-80 years old scheduled for hysterectomy Horizontal or vertical abdominal skin incision Ability to operate a patient-controlled analgesia ( PCA ) device Written informed consent .

AIP is caused by a genetic defect in porphobilinogen deaminase ( PBGD ) , a key enzyme for heme synthesis . AIP is characterized by acute episodes and asymptomatic periods . Neuropathic symptoms are predominantly in these attacks , which may be related to the toxic effect produced by the precursors delta-aminolevulinic acid ( ALA ) and porphobilinogen ( PBG ) , accumulated because the enzyme deficiency . It occurs with very low prevalence ( 1 in 50,000 ) , but figures for prevalence based on clinical manifestations ( i.e. , acute attacks ) greatly underestimate the number of patients with latent AIP . Abdominal pain is the most common symptom , sometimes with constipation . Paresthesia and paralysis also occur , and death may result from respiratory paralysis . Other symptoms , including seizures , psychotic episodes , and hypertension , develop during acute attacks . They may be precipitated by porphyrogenic drugs such as barbiturates , progestogens and sulfonamides , some of which are known to induce the first rate-controlling step in heme synthesis , ALA synthesis .

University of Louisville,NCT02099240,Patients Response to Early Switch To Oral:Osteomyelitis Study,Julio Ramirez,0,0,Osteomyelitis,Drug,oral antibiotics,Treatment,,"Based on the current literature , investigators hypothesize that patients with osteomyelitis who are treated with the standard approach of intravenous antibiotics for the full duration of therapy will have the same clinical outcomes as patients treated with the experimental approach of intravenous antibiotics with early switch to oral antibiotics . The primary objective of this study is to compare patients with osteomyelitis treated with the standard approach of intravenous antibiotics for the full duration of therapy versus patients treated with intravenous antibiotics with an early switch to oral antibiotics in relation to clinical outcomes at 12 months after discontinuation of antibiotic therapy . Secondary objectives of the study include the evaluation of adverse events related to the use of antibiotics as well as the cost of care evaluated from the hospital perspective .","1.1 . Background Information Osteomyelitis is a common disease associated with significant morbidity and high cost ( 1 ) . The treatment of osteomyelitis can be challenging requiring prolonged administration of antibiotics and extensive surgical procedures . Even when the infection is treated , the relapse rate is as high as 20 % ( 2 ) . When a bone is infected , the local multiplication of bacteria produces a local inflammatory response with presence of neutrophils and macrophages with areas of microthrombi and avascular necrosis . If a significant area of avascular necrosis develops , a segment of the bone without any blood supply can become separated and form a sequestrum . Since infection of sequestrum occurs in most patients with osteomyelitis , it is considered that in addition to antibiotic treatment , the patient requires surgical intervention for removal of necrotic bone . 1.2 . Scientific Rationale There is agreement regarding the minimal duration of antibiotic therapy for patients with osteomyelitis . Since an infected bone may take 3 to 4 weeks to re -- - vascularize , the duration of therapy should be a minimum of 4 to 6 weeks of antibiotics . Because different organisms can cause osteomyelitis , the initial antibiotic therapy during hospitalization should include broad -- -spectrum antibiotics to cover the most likely organisms . As part of the initial management , a bone biopsy is regularly performed to identify the particular etiologic agent . Once the organism and its antimicrobial susceptibilities are known , the spectrum of antibiotic therapy is narrowed , and the antimicrobial therapy continues with an antibiotic that is targeted according to the susceptibility of the identified pathogen . Targeted antibiotic therapy in patients with osteomyelitis is usually performed after 3 to 5 days of broad spectrum antibiotics , since this is the time required by the microbiology department to generate antimicrobial susceptibilities after the bone biopsy is performed . In regard to the route of antibiotic administration , the standard approach is to use an intravenous antibiotic . 1.3 . Potential Risks A potential risk for the use of an early switch to oral antibiotics in patients with osteomyelitis is that the blood level achieved with oral antibiotics may not be high enough to attain clinical resolution of the infection . 1.4 . Potential Benefits There are several potential benefits of using oral antibiotics instead of intravenous antibiotics . First , avoiding a peripherally inserted central line eliminates the risk of line infection and line -- -associated deep vein thrombosis . An early switch to oral antibiotics may also facilitate early hospital discharge . A shorter hospital stay will decrease the risk of hospital -- -associated complications such as hospital -- -acquired infections . Further , the patients ' quality of life may be better without a central line . Finally , the total cost of therapy will be significantly reduced with oral therapy . 2 . Methods 2.1 . Trial design & setting This will be a prospective , randomized , unblinded clinical trial to define if the clinical outcomes of patients with osteomyelitis treated with the experimental approach of intravenous antibiotics with an early switch to oral therapy is non -- -inferior to the current standard approach of intravenous antibiotics for the full duration of therapy . 2.8 . Sample Size & Statistical Analysis The null hypothesis for this study will be as follows : H0 : πs -- - πe ≤ -- -Δ Where πs is the proportion of clinical failures in the intravenous therapy only group , πe is the proportion of clinical failures in the intravenous therapy plus early switch to oral therapy group , and Δ is the non -- -inferiority margin . The alternative hypothesis will be : HA : πs -- - πe > -- -Δ We expect that there will be a 20 % clinical failure rate for the primary outcome in both the intravenous antibiotic therapy group and the intravenous antibiotic therapy plus early switch to oral antibiotic therapy group . The study will be powered at 80 % with Δ of 0.1 . A total of 396 patients will be needed to obtain a 95 % confidence interval for the difference in failure rates between the two groups that has a lower limit above -- -Δ . If the lower limit of this 95 % confidence interval for the 10 difference in clinical failure rates between the two arms is above -Δ , non -- -inferiority will be met . Considering that approximately 15 % of patients will be lost during study follow -- -up , a total of 456 patients will be enroll in the trial to obtain the 396 patients necessary for final analyses . 3 .

Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Saint Etienne,NCT02091479,Early Versus Late Resumption of Anticoagulation in Patients With Both High Thrombosis Risk and Major HEmoRrhage,Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Saint Etienne,3,0,Major hæmorrhage,Drug,UFH Early group,Treatment,,"In patients with a high thromboembolic risk , withdrawing anticoagulant treatment is recommended in some situations , including when major hæmorrhage occurs . But withdrawing treatment can be risky . In patients on a curative dose of anticoagulant medicine , treatment withdrawal heightens the risk of thromboembolic events occurring , with potentially major consequences . For instance , mechanical valve thrombosis is fatal in 15 % of patients . Resumption of anticoagulation is therefore critical in patients at high risk for thromboembolic events . However , in these patients having presented major hæmorrhage , resumption of anticoagulation heightens the risk of hæmorrhage recurrence . This risk is even higher when the original hæmorrhage was not accessible via surgical , endoscopic or endoluminal hemostasis . As far as investigators know , there is no data in the literature to rely on when the major hæmorrhage is not accessible via hemostatic intervention and the risk of thrombosis is high . When confronted with patients who need anticoagulation but have a high risk of hæmorrhage recurrence , the question of when treatment should be resumed has not been resolved . This is why investigators propose to conduct a randomised comparative study to evaluate two treatment strategies - early resumption ( H48 to H72 ) versus late resumption ( H120 to H144 ) of anticoagulation . MAIN OBJECTIVE : The main objective of the present study is to evaluate in terms of bleeding risk , thrombosis risk and mortality at one month , the effect of early vs. late resumption of anticoagulation in patients having presented with serious hæmorrhage while on curative-dose anticoagulants and facing a high thromboembolic risk .","STUDY DESIGN : This is a comparative , randomised , open study assessing after 1 month and 3 months the effect of early ( H48 to 72 ) versus late ( H120 to 144 ) resumption of anticoagulation in patients presenting with serious bleeding while on anticoagulants ( excluding intracerebral bleeding ) and with a thromboembolic risk evaluated as high ( except mitral prostheses ) . The accumulated frequency of major hæmorrhage , thromboembolic events and deaths should be 26 % in case of early resumption and 15 % in case of late resumption , i.e . a relative risk reduction of 43 % . Based on this hypothesis , to obtain 80 % power with two-sided α being 5 % , each group should include 208 patients , for a total of 416 patients . EVALUATION CRITERIA : The main criteria in this study will be the accumulated one-month incidence of hæmorrhage recurrence , thromboembolic complications and deaths . It is a combined criterion associating : Fatal hæmorrhage proven by autopsy or sudden deaths in a clinical context strongly suggestive of hæmorrhage Fatal thromboembolic events proven by autopsy or imagery or sudden deaths in a clinical context strongly suggestive of thrombosis Any clinically significant hæmorrhage leading to temporary ( > 24 hours ) or permanent withdrawal of anticoagulant treatment Any symptomatic thromboembolic event in any territory , proven by imagery or surgery These events will be validated by a committee for the validation of critical events blind to the date of anticoagulant treatment resumption .

The Netherlands Cancer Institute,NCT02091765,RCT of an Internet-based CBT Program for Sexuality and Intimacy Problems in Women Treated for Breast Cancer,The Netherlands Cancer Institute,3,1,Sexual Dysfunction,Behavioral,Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy.,Treatment,,The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of an internet-based cognitive behavioural therapy program in alleviating problems with intimacy and sexuality in women treated for breast cancer .,"Background . Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women in the Netherlands , with an incidence of 71 per 100.000 person-years , and a lifetime risk of 10 % . Currently , 85 % of women with breast cancer live longer than 5 years , and 75 % 10 years or longer ( 1,2 ) . As a result , more interest and research has focused on the health-related quality of life ( HRQL ) of breast cancer survivors , including issues of sexuality and intimacy . Compelling evidence has established that sexual dysfunction is a prevalent , long term complication of breast cancer and its treatment ( 3,4-11 ) . Overall , approximately 50 % of breast cancer survivors report some form of sexual dysfunction as a result of treatment ( 6,10,13-15 ) . Frequently reported problems regarding intimacy and sexuality include decreased sexual desire ( 23-64 % ) , decreased arousal or lubrication ( 20-48 % ) , anorgasmia ( 16-36 % ) and dyspareunia ( 35-38 % ) ( 10 ) . Hill et al . report that over 40 % of the breast cancer and gynaecological cancer survivors in their study expressed interest in receiving professional sexual health care ( 15 ) . However , there is a significant discrepancy between the self-reported need for professional sexual health care and the actual uptake of care ( 16 ) . Hill et al . ( 15 ) reported that , although over 40 % of their sample expressed interest in receiving professional care , only 7 % had ever actually sought such care . Although sexual functioning is an important issue , it may be difficult for women to initiate discussion with their general practitioner or medical specialist . Health care professionals may also be reluctant to query about sexual problems , due to time constraints , embarrassment , and/or lack of experience and communication skills in this area ( 16,17 ) . Many women consider face-to-face sexual counselling to be confronting , and see internet-based interventions as a less threatening and more acceptable approach ( 18,19 ) . There is growing evidence that internet-based cognitive behavioural therapy ( CBT ) can effectively treat a range of psychosocial problems , including anxiety , depression and PTSD ( 20,21 ) . More recently , internet-based cognitive behavioural therapy programs for sexual dysfunction have been developed , typically paralleling the content of face-to-face therapy , with studies showing the efficacy of these internet-based programs in improving sexual functioning ( 22-25 ) . Design . This pragmatic clinical trial will employ a prospective , randomized design with one intervention group and a control group . Potentially eligible patients will be identified through the hospital registries . These patients will be sent a letter signed by their treating/former surgeon , together with an informational brochure about the study and possible cancer-related intimacy and sexuality problems . Women who are potentially interested in participating in the study will be asked to indicate this on the enclosed response card . Women who are not interested in participation will be requested to return the response card to indicate their motive ( s ) for not being able to participate . Women who are not interested in participation or who do not respond to the invitation to participate in the study will not be contacted again . If interested , women are asked to write down their contact information . Those women who return the questionnaire will be contacted by telephone by one of the members of the study staff to inform them more thoroughly about the study purpose and procedures . At this time , additional questions will be posed regarding current treatment of sexuality/intimacy problems , current participation in a research trial with a focus on alleviating sexuality/intimacy problems , access to internet , date of breast cancer diagnosis , and completion/continuation of the different parts of treatment of breast cancer ( chemotherapy , radiation therapy , endocrine treatment ) . Those women who remain interested in the study and who appear to be eligible will undergo an intake evaluation by telephone with a sexologist who will carry out a more extensive diagnostic interview in order to determine final eligibility of the woman for the internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy program . Questions will be asked about problems with sexuality and intimacy and relationship/marriage . If the woman meets final eligibility criteria , she will receive a baseline questionnaire , together with an informed consent form . The questionnaire will assess sociodemographic and medical background variables , and the primary ( sexuality and intimacy problems ) and secondary study outcomes ( body image , menopausal symptoms , marital functioning , psychological distress and health-related quality of life ) . In total , 160 consenting women will be randomized to either the intervention group ( n = 80 ) , or to a control group ( n = 80 ) using the minimization technique , with primary surgery ( breast conserving treatment ; mastectomy without reconstructive surgery ; mastectomy with reconstructive surgery ) , menopausal status ( premenopausal ; postmenopausal ) , current endocrine treatment for breast cancer ( yes ; no ) , and time since breast cancer diagnosis ( < 1 year ; 1-3 yrs ; 3-5 yrs ) as stratification variables . Women allocated to the intervention group will be asked to complete a battery of questionnaires assessing primary and secondary outcomes at four points in time : ten weeks after the start of the CBT program ( T1 ) , and at post-treatment ( T2 ; to achieve an equivalent average assessment time for both study groups , women in the intervention group complete T2 post-treatment , but always between 20 and 24 weeks after start of therapy . Women who finish the CBT prior to 20 weeks complete T2 20 weeks after start of therapy ) . The last two questionnaires are completed 3-months after completion of therapy ( T3 ) and 6 months after T3 ( T4 ) . The control group is not asked to complete T3 or T4 , but rather is given the opportunity to undergo the intervention following completion of T2 . This was done because it was not deemed ethically acceptable to withhold the intervention from women in the control group for the prolonged period of time that would be required if they were to be first asked to complete all follow-up sessions ( i.e. , approximately one year after study enrollment ) . To minimize respondent burden , the T4 questionnaire only includes questionnaires assessing the primary outcome measures . Control group . Women who are assigned to the control group will be contacted by telephone by a member of the study staff to inform them about this allocation . These women will receive a booklet per mail that addresses 80 questions about sexuality and cancer . Six weeks later , women in the control group will receive an empathetic phone call from one of the sexologists , during which there is also time available to discuss further questions the participants may have concerning sexuality and cancer . The purpose of keeping in contact with the control group , as opposed to a pure waiting list control group , is creating the opportunity to provide some control for a possible attention placebo-effect . Ten weeks post study entry , women in the control group will be asked to complete the first follow-up questionnaire . After completion of the questionnaire , women in the control group will be telephoned by a member of the study staff for another empathetic conversation . Women in the control group will complete a final questionnaire twenty weeks post study entry , after which they will be given the opportunity to undergo the internet-based cognitive behavioral program . Intervention group . For women allocated to the intervention group , the sexologist will develop a tailored treatment plan , consisting of a maximum of 10 treatment modules ( see below for a more detailed description of the intervention ) . The therapist has received specialized training in the nature of breast cancer and its treatment , in general , and more specifically sexuality and intimacy issues associated with breast cancer and its treatment . Each woman is assigned a personal sexologist ( therapist ) who guides her through the internet-based CBT program and provides feedback on the homework assignments . Contact with the therapist is fully web-based , via a secured website . The CBT program comprises a maximum of ten treatment modules that can be used in varying order . The choice of modules to be used by any given woman is based on the information obtained via the screening by telephone and the intake evaluation by the therapist . Each module contains three interventions and a personal evaluation form to report on the intervention . Each intervention comprises the following elements : 1 ) introduction , 2 ) psycho-education about symptoms , 3 ) `` homework '' assignments ( e.g . relaxation techniques ( pelvis ) ; discuss intimacy with partner ; sensate focus ) and 4 ) reporting back to the therapist and receiving feedback on the `` homework '' assignments . Each week there are two `` practice '' sessions of 30 minutes each and one hour per week to report on/evaluate the intervention . The therapy has a mean duration of 20 weeks.The modules include : ( 1 ) `` Put your problem into words '' where the client describes her problems , is asked to distinguish between feelings , thoughts , and behaviors , and learns about what intimacy is and how it interplays with sexuality , the sexual response curve and the most common ( psycho ) sexual problems ; ( 2 ) `` How is my relationship doing ? '' in which the client explores how intimate the relationship actually is , becomes aware of the amount of quality time spent with the partner , receives psycho-education about sex and intimacy , the importance of open communication with the partner , and advice on how to improve open communication ; ( 3 ) `` Sex and my body '' during which the client first experiences sensate focus therapy ( targeted at becoming more comfortable with one 's own body and achieving ( non ) sexual intimacy with one 's partner physically and emotionally ) ; ( 4 ) `` Focus my attention '' in which the client receives task concentration training to learn to focus her attention on sexual experiences ; ( 5 ) `` Explore my body '' in which sensate focus therapy is further used , and the client writes about her experiences with the homework exercises within a cognitive behavioral framework ( with particular focus on inhibiting thoughts ) ; ( 6 & 7 ) `` Discovering my sexual arousal feelings ( versions for the woman and for her partner ) in which psycho-education is provided about genital stimulation , sexual techniques , etc. , and how to discuss sexual feelings with the partner ; ( 8 ) `` Change my thoughts '' that involves cognitive restructuring to promote adaptive thoughts ; ( 9 ) `` My sexual preferences '' in which the client talks about her sexual preferences with her partner , and makes an action plan for behavior change ; and ( 10 ) `` Relapse prevention '' in which the client writes about her former automatic behavior and the risk factors for relapse , after which a plan of action is made in case of a relapse . Study measures . The primary outcomes ( sexuality and intimacy problems ) are measured using the Sexual Activity Questionnaire , Female Sexual Functioning Scale , Female Sexual Distress Scale and the Personal Assessment of Intimacy in Relationships . Secondary outcomes measures include QLQ-BR23 ( body image ) , FACT-ES ( menopausal symptoms ) , Maudsley Marital Questionnaire ( marital functioning ) , Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale ( psychological distress ) and MOS SF-36 ( health-related quality of life ) . Program adherence . Women who do not complete their tailored internet-based therapy program will be asked to indicate the reason ( s ) for their discontinuation ( e.g. , illness , lack of motivation , burden , etc. ) . Every effort will be made to obtain a final , post-intervention assessment for all women , regardless of whether they do or do not complete their therapy . This will facilitate a maximum sample size for the primary , 'intention-to-treat ' analysis of between-group differences over time . Additionally , all women , including those in the control group , will be asked if , during the period of the study , they pursued any ( other ) activities relating to their sexual and intimacy issues . Patients ' evaluation of the intervention program . At the end of their treatment , women in the intervention group will be asked about their experience with the module , the homework assignments , and the feedback received from the therapist . Additionally , immediate post-treatment , these women will be asked whether they would suggest any changes to the program , and if they would recommend it to other women experiencing similar problems . Semi-structured interview . A subset of women ( approximately 15 from the intervention group ) will be asked to participate in a telephone interview . This semi-structured interview will cover the same topic areas as addressed by the self-report questionnaire , allowing women to provide feedback in a more narrative form about their sexual wellbeing and their experience with the CBT program . Women will also be asked if their partner would be willing to share his/her experience with the program ( where applicable ) . The interview protocol has been developed and pilot-tested during the preparatory phase of the study . Sample size and statistical power calculations . The prospective study design will allow for testing of the main effect of the internet-based intervention program . The SAQ , FSFI , FSFS and PAIR Inventory are the primary outcome measures on which sample size calculations are based . Specifically , the difference between the SAQ , FSFI and FSDS scores at baseline , mid-treatment ( e.g . after 10 weeks ) , post-treatment ( e.g . after 20 weeks ) , at 3 months follow-up ( T3 ) and at 9 months follow-up ( T4 ) will be calculated for each patient , and these changes will be the primary endpoints of the study . The mean of these differences in scores will be compared with the minimal intervention control group . With a total sample of 130 women ( 65 per group ) , and under the assumption of no interaction , the study will have 80 % power to detect an effect size of 0.5 for the main effects of the web based intervention program , with the p value set at 0.05 . 160 women will be recruited into the study , to allow for an attrition rate of approximately 20 % ( i.e. , women who discontinue participation in the study entirely , including failure to complete all follow-up questionnaires ) . Those women who discontinue participation in one of the groups but complete the follow-up assessments will be included in the intention-to-treat analysis . Statistical analyses . Analysis will first be performed to evaluate the comparability of the intervention and control group at baseline in terms of sociodemographic and clinical characteristics . Student 's t-test or appropriate non-parametric statistics will be used , depending on the level of measurement . If , despite the stratified randomization procedures , the groups are found not to be comparable on one or more background variables , those variables will be employed routinely as covariates in subsequent analyses . Questionnaire scores will be calculated according to published scoring algorithms . Between-group differences over time in mean scores will be tested using multilevel analysis . Effect sizes will be calculated using standard statistical procedures . Effect sizes of 0.2 will be considered as small , 0.5 moderate , and 0.8 large . Effect sizes of approximately 0.4 will be considered as clinically relevant . All analysis will , to as great an extent as possible , be conducted on an intention-to-treat basis . The variables used in the minimization procedure will be employed as covariates . Per protocol analyses will also be carried out ( as a secondary analysis ) , comparing women who meet minimal compliance levels ( to be defined ) with the program to the control group . We will also use correlation analyses to examine the relationship between degree of program adherence , partner involvement , and program effect . As indicated previously , the SAQ , FSFI , FSDS and PAIR inventory will be used as the primary study endpoints , and the remaining measures will be considered as secondary endpoints . For the analysis of these latter variables , appropriate statistical ( p value ) adjustments will be made for multiple testing . Since the sample size will not provide sufficient power to conduct subgroup analyses , an interaction term ( group x time since diagnosis ) will be added to the analyses . The semi-structured interview data will be transcribed and content analyzed to extract narrative , qualitative information about the women 's sexual and intimacy problems and , where relevant , their experience with the intervention .",2014-03-07,"August 26, 2019","Inclusion Criteria : Woman .

University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center,NCT02219321,Lidocaine Infusion for Chronic Pain in Opioid Dependent Patients,University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center,3,0,Chronic Pain,Drug,Lidocaine infusion,Treatment,Triple,"Prescription drug abuse represents a major healthcare problem , with treatment costs reaching billions of dollars annually in the United States alone . Today opioids are commonly prescribed for chronic non-cancer pain and are only partially effective for short-term pain relief . Whereas opioids are initially part of the solution for pain , it eventually often turns to be a problem in patient with chronic pain . Long-term treatment with opioids can be complicated by development of tolerance , dependency , addiction , abnormal pain sensitivity , hormonal changes , and immune modulation . Unfortunately , the chronic use of anti-inflammatory drugs is associated with a marked increase in adverse effects . The purpose of this study is to determine whether systemic administration of lidocaine provides effective pain relief in opioid dependent chronic pain patients . Investigators intend to demonstrate that lidocaine infusion can improve pain relief and physical function in opioid dependent patients , thus improving compliance and patient satisfaction , which may potentially help wean patients off narcotics . The long-term goal of this proposal is to decrease opioid dependence in chronic pain patients by using lidocaine infusion .","There is a significant disconnect between the escalating healthcare problem of opioid use for chronic pain , and the development of novel therapeutic strategies . A plausible strategy is to interrupt the vicious cycle of pain , inflammation and hyperesthesia is using highly efficacious non-opioid drugs that do not require chronic administration , such as lidocaine . Lidocaine is FDA approved local anesthetic , class 2 antiarrhythmic with analgesic , antihyperalgesic and anti-inflammatory properties without rewarding and addictive properties . Intravenous lidocaine has been utilized since 1943 for a large spectrum of pain conditions . Lidocaine also has been shown to significantly reduce circulating inflammatory cytokines production . Investigators propose that systemic administration of lidocaine will decrease the intensity , duration of pain in opioid dependent chronic pain patients . The long-term goal of this proposal is to decrease opioid dependence in chronic pain patients by using lidocaine infusion . The central hypothesis is that lidocaine infusion decreases the intensity of pain in opioid dependent chronic pain patients . Primary outcome : To determine the short-term effect of lidocaine infusion on the intensity of pain in opioid dependent chronic pain patients . Secondary outcome1 : Determine the duration of pain relief after lidocaine infusion in opioid dependent chronic pain patients . Investigators hypothesize that lidocaine infusions will have a long lasting Visual Analog Pain ( VAS ) score improvement that will extend beyond the time of infusion . This intermediate and long-term pain relief will be demonstrated by measuring both VAS pain scores 3 times a day for 3 weeks and by the reduction in daily opioid use by 25 % . Secondary outcome2 : Determine the effect of lidocaine infusion on opioid induced hyperalgesia . Lidocaine infusion may decrease cytokine levels both acutely after infusion as compared to baseline , as well as at the end of 1 week after infusion . STUDY DESIGN AND POPULATION : Forty opioid dependent patients will be randomized in a double blind parallel placebo control study to investigate the effects of lidocaine on neuropathic pain . Patients who meet the inclusion criteria will receive Initial laboratory work-up prior to infusion date . Each patient will receive a Hepatic panel , CBC , and Chemistry and baseline cytokine levels ( IL1b ) as well as a baseline Cold Pressor Test ( CPT ) and then will be randomized to either receive lidocaine or placebo . Study Intervention : Lidocaine intravenous 2mg/kg initial bolus over 5 minutes followed by a continuous intravenous infusion of lidocaine at a rate of 2mg /kg /hour for 4 hours versus saline of same volume and duration . Duration of the study : Patient will be followed for 3 weeks after the lidocaine infusion . Monitoring during infusion : Heart rate , blood pressure , EKG , oxygen saturation , and any potential side effects as sedation , circumoral numbness , metallic taste in the mouth will be continuously monitored and recorded every 15 minutes ( standard monitoring and recording time in recovery area ) as well as pain scores . After completion of infusion patient will be further monitored for another 2 hrs and then discharged after meeting standard discharge criteria according to Aldrete scoring system . Discharge instruction : Patients will be asked to decrease their daily opioid dose by 25 % . Patients will receive a one-week supply of a short acting opioid as a rescue medication . Patients will be asked to use the rescue medication if pain is moderate to severe for the first day after infusion . If no improvement in pain despite allowable short acting medication as reported on first day post infusion follow up phone call , patient will be asked to resume their usual long acting opioid dose . Each patient will receive a pain diary sheet where they will record their daily visual analogue pain scores 3 times a day as well as their daily opioid dose plus over the counter analgesic requirements as NSAIDS and acetaminophen . Patients will follow up every week till study completion , where pain diary , over the counter and rescue pain medications will be assessed . Outcome Measures : Visual Analog Pain ( VAS ) Scores Serum interleukin Ib level CPT Daily opioid use Subject Safety and Data Monitoring : All subjects will be carefully assessed prior to participation in the studies , including medical history , laboratory tests , and examination by a board-certified physician ( Dr. Kandil ) . Subjects with medical problems that would increase risk for participation will be excluded from the study . During the infusion patient 's vital signs : heart rate , blood pressure , EKG , oxygen saturation , and any potential side effects as sedation , circumoral numbness , metallic taste in the mouth will be continuously monitored and recorded every 15 minutes as well as pain scores . All lidocaine/saline infusions will be supervised by Dr. Enas Kandil , an anesthesiologist . Dr. Kandil or a nurse will be in attendance during throughout the infusion . Heart rate , including EKG rhythm strip , will be monitored continuously throughout the infusion and blood pressure will be obtained every 15 minutes and more frequently if indicated . If the participants ' hemodynamics ( heart rate , blood pressure ) change by more than 20 % ( typically a consequence of cardiac arrhythmias ) the infusion will be stopped . The more serious toxic effects of lidocaine ( e.g . unconsciousness , confusion , convulsions , respiratory arrest ) are preceded by numbness of the tongue , lightheadedness , visual disturbances and muscle twitching ; infusions will be terminated if the subject reports of any of these latter signs or symptoms . A checklist of signs and symptoms will be obtained every 15 minutes . Subjects will be observed for at least two hours ( approximately one half-life of lidocaine ) following the cessation of lidocaine ( or saline ) infusion . Dr. Kandil must approve discharge for all participants on the infusion study day . Lidocaine labels carry warnings and precautions for use in patients with various cardiac conditions , notably conduction abnormalities ( e.g. , heart block , QT prolongation ) . Cardiac conditions will be identified by EKG , medical history and physical exam . Participants with any medical history of cardiac disease ( e.g . myocardial infarction , congestive heart failure , cardiac arrhythmia ) or an abnormal EKG ( including any arrhythmia , heart block , QT prolongation ) will be excluded . Women with a positive pregnancy test or who report unprotected heterosexual sex since their previous menses will not receive an infusion . Women with a positive pregnancy test will be referred for appropriate care . Subjects will be observed for at least two hours ( approximately one half-life of lidocaine ) following the cessation of lidocaine ( or saline ) infusion .

"Charite University, Berlin, Germany",NCT02358265,Chronic Urticaria - Long Term Assessment of Effects of Rupatadine,"Charite University, Berlin, Germany",3,0,Chronic Urticaria,Drug,10 mg Rupatadine on demand,Treatment,Double,To compare CSU disease activity at the end of the follow up phase between patients that had been treated daily continuously vs. on-demand in the treatment phase,"The treatment of CSU with nsAHs is currently the most common and only licensed therapeutic option to reduce the patients ' wheal and flare type skin reactions and pruritus . CSU is a highly fluctuating disease and the severity of symptoms can change markedly from day to day . This is one of the reasons why , in routine daily practice , many patients tend to perform an on demand rather than a continuous , daily , preventive treatment of their symptoms with nsAHs . While in the field of allergic rhinitis several studies point towards a better efficacy of nsAHs if continuously given ( 6-8 ) , the only study in CSU comparing both treatment approaches was published by Grob and colleagues ( 9 ) . They were able to demonstrate that continuous daily treatment with the nsAH desloratadine resulted in significantly better quality of life as compared to on demand therapy . While these studies indicate that the treatment schedule can generally have a major impact on the outcome of treatment , the results on the efficacy of on demand nsAHs in CSU remains to be confirmed independently . In addition to the optimal treatment schedule , there is an ongoing discussion regarding the long-term outcome of nsAH treatment . While the mode of action of nsAHs suggests a pure symptomatic therapeutic effect , there have been speculations that a disease modification effect might also occur . Indeed , in 2010 , a Japanese group ( Kono et al . ) presented data on the EADV meeting in Gothenburg demonstrating that continuous prophylactic antihistamine therapy of CSU patients with ebastine ( a nsAH ) for a period of three months was associated with a lower recurrence rate after discontinuation than the same treatment lasting for only one month , provided that the drug was effective and safe during early treatment . As of yet , these results also have to be confirmed independently . Sufficient reduction of urticarial symptoms requires higher than the licensed dosing of antihistamines in many CSU patients ( 10-14 ) . In fact , increasing the dose of nsAHs up to fourfold has been shown to be more effective as compared to the standard dose in different subforms of chronic urticaria ( 10 , 11 , 14 ) . However , for some patients even high dosed nsAHs are not enough to effectively suppress disease symptoms ( 11-14 ) . The exact reasons for this are still unknown . Probably , other mediators than histamine are also involved in the development of urticaria symptoms . One such other candidate mediator is platelet activating factor ( PAF ) . PAF is a potent phospholipid mediator with various biological activities , including platelet aggregation , airway constriction , hypotension , and vascular permeation . PAF also mediates allergic reactions and has been claimed to contribute to the pathogenesis of urticaria . Intradermal PAF injection results in a pruritic wheal and flare reaction in subjects with and without allergies ( 15 ) . PAF injection is followed by a dose-dependent histamine release in vivo ( 16 ) and in cold contact urticaria , there is evidence available that PAF is an additional important mediator associated with the inflammatory reaction in the skin ( 17 , 18 ) . Notably , Krause et al . could demonstrate that intradermal PAF injection results in a wheal and flare type skin reaction without inducing mast cell degranulation ( 19 ) . PAF may , therefore , be a relevant mediator in the pathogenesis of urticaria that acts downstream of mast cell activation and is independent of H1-receptor activation . Rupatadine , is a drug which possesses a potent antihistamine and PAF antagonistic activity and , recently , it has been demonstrated to be safe and effective in the treatment of chronic urticaria ( 3 , 4 ) and cold contact urticaria ( 5 ) . Notably , it has also been shown that an increased dose of 20 mg rupatadine is more effective in the treatment of CSU symptoms as compared to the licensed 10 mg dose ( 20 ) . In summary , it seems more than reasonable to use rupatadine as a study drug in patients with CSU in order to better characterize the best nsAH treatment schedule ( continuous vs. on-demand ) , the long-term outcome of nsAH therapy and the influence of updosing on the latter .",2014-12-18,"September 15, 2019","Inclusion criteria : Male or female aged 18 years and older Documented history of active CSU ( urticaria and wheals ) with or without an associated angioedema for at least three days per week over the last 6 weeks prior to visit 1 ( screening ) .

Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital,NCT02388360,The Impact of Topical Prostaglandins on the Biomechanical Properties of the Cornea in Patients With Open Angle Glaucoma,Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital,4,1,"Glaucoma, Open-Angle",Drug,topical prostaglandin analogs,Treatment,,The purpose of this study is to determine the influence of topical prostaglandin analog ( PGA ) medication on corneal biomechanical properties in patients undergoing PGA treatment for open-angle glaucoma .,"Patients : Thirty five patients ( seventy eyes ) with bilateral open angle glaucoma on monotherapy with topical PGA medication in both eyes were recruited from the Montreal Glaucoma Institute , Montreal , QC , Canada . Informed consent was acquired from all participants . The research protocol of this study adhered to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki . It was approved by the Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital Ethics committee ( Montreal , QC , Canada ) and all patients signed a research consent form . Study Procedures : Consenting patients undergoing topical PGA treatment in both eyes were asked to discontinue the PGA in their best eye and to continue the administration of PGA in the contralateral eye . All measurements were taken before PGA cessation ( Visit 1 ) and repeated 6 weeks after cessation ( Visit 2 ) . Patients then restarted the application of PGA to the experimental eye and all measurements were repeated once more after an additional 6 weeks ( Visit 3 ) . The best eye was selected based on less glaucoma damages . It was defined by the results of the Humphrey Visual Field ( HFA , Carl Zeiss Meditec , Inc. , Dublin , CA ) , Heidelberg Retinal Tomograph ( HRT II , Heidelberg Engineering GmbH , Heidelberg , Germany ) and Optical Coherence Tomography ( CIRRUS HD-OCT , Carl Zeiss Meditec , Inc. , Dublin , CA ) . The Humphrey Visual Field defines early glaucoma as a mean defect ( MD ) of -2.00 to -6.00 db , moderate glaucoma as a MD of -6.10 to -12.0 db and advanced as a MD less than -12.0 db . The Optical Coherence Tomography enables the identification of the better linear Cup/Disk ratio , Rim area , RNFL thickness and ganglion cells analysis between both of the patient 's eyes . The lesser of the maximum IOP values recorded in each of the patient 's eyes also contributed to the selection of the best eye . Instruments : The Ocular Response Analyzer ( ORA ) ( Reichert , INC , Depew , NY ) was used to assess the biomechanical properties of the cornea . This instrument utilizes a dynamic bi-directional applanation process to measure the biomechanical properties of cornea and estimate IOP . A rapid air pulse applies force to the cornea and an advanced electro-optical system monitors corneal deformation . A precisely-metered collimated-air-pulse pushes the cornea inwards , past a flat state and into a slight concavity . Milliseconds after applanation , the air pump shuts off and the pressure gradually declines . As the pressure decreases , the cornea first passes through an applanated state before resuming its original curved structure . The applanation detection system monitors the corneal movement throughout the entire process . Two separate pressure values are derived from the INWARD and OUTWARD applanation events . The difference between these two pressure values is termed CH . This biomechanical property reflects corneal absorption and dissipation of the energy from an applied force . Derived from the measurement of CH is the Corneal resistance factor ( CRF ) . CRF represents the cornea 's ability to resist deformation in the presence of an external force . Goldmann applanation tonometry ( Haag-Streit AG , Koeniz , Switzerland ) is still recognized as the gold standard for measuring IOP in glaucoma patients and it was performed in all patients at all visits . The ORA takes the CH and CRF measurements into account to generate the corneal-compensated intraocular pressure ( IOPcc ) value , which is mean to be less affected by corneal biomechanical properties than the Goldmann-IOP . The IOP bias is estimated as the difference between IOPcc and Goldmann-IOP ( IOPcc - Goldmann IOP ) . A positive bias value indicates that the IOPcc is larger than the Goldmann-IOP , meaning that Goldman tonometry underestimated IOP in comparison to the IOPcc . Four ORA measurements were taken per eye and the mean value was recorded for each parameter ( CH , CRF and IOPcc ) . Central corneal thickness ( CCT ) was measured by ultrasound pachymetry ( DGH Technology , INC , Exton , PA ) and the average of three measurements was recorded . All study measurements were performed by the same trained observer ( RM ) , with the same equipment and at the same time of day . All of the equipment needed for this research was calibrated prior to each use . Statistical Analysis : The hypothesis of no effect regarding the discontinuation of PGA on the biomechanical properties was examined by a linear mixed-effect model using the nlme package in R. Random-effects were defined on two levels : the patient ( level-1 ) and the eye within each patient ( level-2 ) . Those random-effects were added to the model to account for the intra-individual variance due to the repeated-measure design . Age was also included in the model as a covariate . Contrasts between the eyes and times were estimated using adjusted p-values to control for familywise error rate using multcomp package in R .",2014-12-20,"February 24, 2021","Inclusion Criteria : patients with bilateral open angle glaucoma on monotherapy with topical PGA medication in both eyes Exclusion Criteria : corneal disease ( such as Fuchs ' endothelial dystrophy or keratoconus ) past history of corneal trauma or surgery ( including refractive surgery ) that may affect hysteresis measurements contact lens wearers uncontrolled glaucoma or advanced visual field ( VF ) damage ( mean defect < -12.0 db ) patients taking systemic prostaglandin medication , non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs , or undergoing hormone replacement therapy",35,0,40 Years,85 Years

The objectives of this study are to develop and implement a LDCT screening approach for lung cancer and mesothelioma in asbestos-exposed workers in Alberta ; to determine participants ' motivation and expectations associated with a screening program , their satisfaction with the program , and the psychosocial consequences of the screening program ; to determine the accuracy of a lung cancer risk prediction model modified to include asbestos exposure ; and to determine the 3-year clinical incidence of lung cancer in asbestos-exposed individuals interested in lung cancer screening but who do not meet minimal risk threshold . The investigators will offer a combined lung cancer and mesothelioma screening program for 200 Alberta asbestos-exposed workers based on low-dose CT scanning .",2014-11-27,"May 16, 2022","Inclusion Criteria : Age 50 - 80 years ( either gender , any ethnic group ) Documented exposure to asbestos for at least one year , at least 10 years prior to study entry Ability to provide informed consent and participate in study procedures Exclusion Criteria : Any medical condition , such as severe heart disease ( e.g . unstable angina , chronic congestive heart failure ) , severe lung disease or lung disease requiring supplemental oxygen , solid organ transplant , that in the opinion of the physician unlikely to benefit from screening due to shortened life-expectancy from the co-morbidities or inability to tolerate diagnosis and treatment of a screen detected abnormality Have been previously diagnosed with lung cancer or mesothelioma Have had other cancer within the past 5 years with the exception of the following cancers : non-melanomatous skin cancer , localized prostate cancer , carcinoma in situ ( CIS ) of the cervix , or superficial bladder cancer .

University of the Philippines,NCT02109718,A Trial Comparing the Efficacy and Safety of Open Dressing With Petrolatum Jelly vs. Standard Gauze Dressing With Silver Sulfadiazine,University of the Philippines,3,1,Superficial Partial Thickness Burns,Drug,Open Dressings with Petrolatum Jelly,Treatment,Single,"The Effectiveness of open dressing with petrolatum jelly in minor burns has not been clearly established . This study determined if the use of open dressings with petrolatum jelly as effective as standard gauze dressing with silver sulfadiazine in treating minor burns in terms of time-to-re-epithelialization , incidence of wound infection , incidence of adverse reactions , and patient acceptance . Non-extensive superficial partial thickness burns constitute a major proportion of burn injuries . Conventional treatment involves regular changing of absorptive dressings including the application of a topical antimicrobial , commonly silver sulfadiazine . A systematic review has found insufficient evidence to support or refute such antimicrobial prophylaxis . Another review compared silver sulfadiazine dressings with other occlusive and non-antimicrobial dressings and found insufficient evidence to guide practice . Other research has suggested that dressings with petrolatum gel are as effective as silver sulfadiazine . This trial sought to compare the effectiveness of conventional silver sulfadiazine dressings with treatment with petrolatum gel alone .","Patients with superficial partial thickness burns less than 10 % Total Body Surface Area were recruited . Patients with burns involving the primary areas ( face , hand , groin , joints , feet ) , previous treatment of the burn wound , previous burn injury to the same area , electrical burns , and patients with inhalation injury were excluded Also excluded were patients with diabetes , known sensitivity or allergy to one of the dressings or their constituents and allergy to NSAIDS , those being treated with systemic steroid medication , and patients with AIDS and AIDS related complex . Participants were then randomized to undergo either open dressings with petrolatum jelly or standard gauze dressings with silver sulfadiazine cream . The number of days to complete re-epithelialization was recorded for each patient . The incidence of wound infection and adverse reactions , notably the occurrence of allergic contact dermatitis was also recorded . The study also assessed both dressings in terms of adherence to the wound bed , ease of dressing removal , pain on application and removal of dressings , time required for dressing change and number of dressing changes in between follow-ups .. A total of 50 participants were recruited . Age , sex , race , health condition , location of burn , % Total Body Surface Area area affected , time lag , causative agent , presence of initial cooling maneuver , medical condition , and associated injuries were similar for petrolatum jelly and silver sulfadiazine groups . There was no significant difference with regard to number of days to re-epithelialization . There was also no significant difference between the two treatment groups with regards to pain experienced during application and removal of the dressings , and the number of dressing changes required in between follow-ups . There was , however , a significant difference between open dressings with petrolatum jelly and silver sulfadiazine gauze dressing in terms of adherence to the wound bed , ease of removal of dressings and time required to change dressings . Open dressings with petrolatum jelly were found to be less adherent , easier to remove , and required less time for dressing change . Single-center , randomized , controlled clinical trial . Consenting adults 18-45 years old with superficial partial thickness burns less than or equal to 10 % total body surface area seen within 24 hours of the injury were randomized to daily dressing either with petrolatum gel without top dressings or conventional silver sulfadiazine treatment with gauze dressings . Primary outcomes were blinded assessment of time to complete re-epithelialization , wound infection or allergic contact dermatitis . Secondary outcomes included assessment of ease , time and pain of dressing changes . 50 patients were recruited and follow up data available for 38 . Mean time to re-epithelialization was shorter in the treatment group by more than one day within an overall mean healing time of 7.0 days ( p = 0.050 ) . No wound infection or dermatitis was observed in either group . Scores for adherence to the wound , ease of dressing removal and time required to change dressings were significantly better in the petrolatum treatment arm ( p < 0.01 ) . Petrolatum gel without top dressings may be at least as effective as silver sulfadiazine gauze dressings with regard to time to re-epithelialization , and incidence of infection and allergic contact dermatitis . Petrolatum gel appears to be an effective , affordable and widely available alternative in the treatment of minor superficial partial thickness burns in adults .",2014-03-20,"April 9, 2014","Inclusion Criteria : Patients aged 18-45 years old Superficial partial thickness burns less than or equal to 10 % Total Body Surface Area Exclusion Criteria : Patients with burns involving the primary areas ( face , hand , groin , joints , feet ) Previous treatment of the burn wound Previous burn injury to the same area , electrical burn , and patients with inhalation injury Patients with diabetes , known sensitivity or allergy to one of the dressings or their constituents and allergy to NSAIDS Those being treated with systematic steroid medication Patients with AIDS and AIDS related complex",50,0,18 Years,45 Years
NorthShore University HealthSystem,NCT02109081,Dexamethasone and Postoperative Delirium,NorthShore University HealthSystem,4,0,Delirium,Drug,Dexamethasone,Prevention,Quadruple,"Postoperative delirium is commonly observed in elderly patients in the postanesthesia care unit ( PACU ) and during the first 2-3 days following surgical procedures . This is an important clinical problem in the geriatric surgical patient ; morbidity and mortality rates are significantly higher in patients who develop delirium . At the present time , the etiology of delirium has not been precisely defined . However , studies suggest that inflammation related to the surgical stress response is an important contributing factor in inducing neuroinflammation and subsequent cognitive dysfunction and delirium . Therefore it is possible that agents which attenuate perioperative inflammation may reduce the risk of the development of delirium following surgery . Dexamethasone is a potent corticosteroid that is used by anesthesiologists primarily as an antiemetic agent . Small doses of dexamethasone have also been demonstrated to significantly reduce the release of inflammatory markers after surgery . The anti-inflammatory effects of corticosteroids have the potential to beneficially impact neuroinflammation and the risk of developing postoperative delirium . The aim of this randomized , controlled , double-blinded investigation is to determine if dexamethasone , administered at induction of anesthesia , can decrease the incidence of delirium at the time of discharge from the PACU and during the first 2 days following surgery .","This study will be a randomized , placebo-controlled , double blind clinical investigation . Four hundred patients scheduled for surgical procedures under general anesthesia will be enrolled . Patients will be randomized via a computerized randomization table to one of two groups ; a dexamethasone group ( 10 mg of dexamethasone in a 5 cc syringe ) or a control group ( an equal volume of saline in a 5 cc syringe ) ) . A dose of 10 mg of dexamethasone was selected , as this reflects a dose that has been demonstrated to attenuate the inflammatory response to surgery , decrease pain , and improve clinical recovery . This is also within the dose range commonly used at NorthShore University HealthSystem . The drug/placebo solution will be prepared by the pharmacy into the syringes . Both solutions are clear and appear identical . Study syringes will be prepared by the pharmacy , and all clinicians will be blinded to group assignment . At the induction of anesthesia , the syringe containing either dexamethasone or saline will be administered . The administration of all other anesthetic agents will be standardized and reflect the usual practices of anesthesiologists at NorthShore University HealthSystem . Monitoring will consist of standard American Society of Anesthesiologists monitors , which include manual blood pressure measurements , continuous EKG monitoring , pulse oximetry , capnography and infrared gas analysis . Additional monitoring , such as direct radial artery pressure measurements , will be at the discretion of the attending anesthesiologist . Anesthetic induction will consist of propofol 0.5-2.0 mg/kg , fentanyl 50-100 μg , and rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg . Anesthesia will be maintained with sevoflurane 0.5-3.0 % , with the concentration of inhalational agent adjusted to maintain blood pressure within 20-30 % of baseline values and depth of anesthesia standardized using a BIS monitor ( BIS values 40-60 ) . Additional doses of fentanyl , up to 1-2 µg/kg/hour , can be administered at the discretion of the anesthesia care provider . Hydromorphone may be provided for postoperative analgesia . Hypotension ( any decrease in mean arterial pressure ≥ 20 % ) will be treated with a fluid bolus , phenylephrine , or ephedrine , as clinically indicated . Thirty minutes before the anticipated conclusion of the surgical procedure , patients will receive ondansetron 4 mg. Neuromuscular blockade will be reversed with neostigmine and glycopyrrolate . Patients will be managed according to standard PACU protocols . Nausea and vomiting will be treated per standard protocols . Any episodes of nausea and vomiting in the PACU will be noted on a data collection sheet . Pain will be treated with hydromorphone . Pain scores in the PACU , as well as total doses of hydromorphone will be recorded . Patients will be discharged from the PACU when standard criteria are met . Study subjects will be discharged either to the surgical floor or the intensive care unit ( ICU ) . The times to meet discharge criteria and actually achieve discharge will be recorded . For patients transferred directly to the ICU from the operating room , nausea , vomiting , pain scores , and analgesic requirements will be collected over the first 3 hours of recovery . Postoperatively , pain will be controlled with intravenous doses of hydromorphone . Intravenous analgesia will be provided until patients are able to resume oral intake , which usually occurs on the first or second postoperative day . At this time , analgesic management will be transitioned to oral pain medication ( typically hydrocodone 5 mg / acetaminophen 500 mg ) . Total doses of intravenous and oral pain medications will be recorded during the hospitalization . Postoperative pain scores will be assessed at the same time testing for delirium is performed during the postoperative period . A planned interim analysis will be performed when 200 patients are enrolled",2014-04-05,"December 6, 2021","Inclusion Criteria : patients ≥ 70 years of age , undergoing a noncardiac surgical procedure under general anesthesia , with an anticipated duration of postoperative admission of at least 2 days .

Patients will be randomized to orally given trimetazidine on top of standard medical therapy for stable coronary artery disease versus standard therapy only . The randomization will begin 48 hrs before intervention . Index of microcirculatory resistance ( IMR ) will be measured by thermodilution method using coronary pressure and temperature wire before and after stent implantation . Echocardiography will be performed before intervention and within 30 minutes after intervention . Patients will be followed clinically for a period of one year .","The study is prospective , single blinded randomized study that will be performed in a single tertiary cardiovascular centre . The inclusion criteria for the study are the presence of the stable angina or positive stress test , Canadian Cardiovascular Society ( CCS ) class less than IV and an indication for percutaneous intervention of a single , de novo , native coronary artery lesion with diameter stenosis greater than 70 % . Exclusion criteria are left ventricular systolic function ( LVEF ) less than 30 % , acute coronary syndrome , a history of previous myocardial infarction in the territory supplied by the treated coronary artery , existence of the collateral circulation to another coronary artery supplied by the treated vessel , chronic total occlusion , significant bifurcation lesion , previous surgical revascularization , significant renal function impairment ( GFR less than 60ml/min ) , allergy to any constituents of trimetazidine , aspirin and antiplatelet medications used after PCI , contrast agents , contraindication to adenosine use . The patient with disorders like Parkinson disease , parkinsonian symptoms , tremors , restless leg syndrome , and other related movement disorders will also be excluded from the study . Patients , who are trimetazidine naïve , will be randomly assigned to receive either trimetazidine plus previous medications ( TMZ group ) 48h before scheduled PCI or just previous medication ( Control group ) . Paients that are TMZ naïve and randomized to TMZ group will be given loading of 70mg of TMZ on day 0 . The PCI operator would not be aware if the patient receives TMZ . All patients will be pretreated before PCI with aspirin 100mg/day , Clopidogrel 75mg/day seven days before the procedure . Patient will be asked to sign informed consent form before entering the study and the study protocol was approved by Ethics committee of Clinical Hospital Center Zemun . Patients will undergo PCI intervention on day 2 . Before PCI patients will receive heparin 80 - 100 IU/kg iv . PCI procedure has to be performed with angioplasty balloon predilation of the treated lesion to avoid influence of direct stenting on IMR measurement . The stenting will be performed according to operator 's preference . The fractional flow reserve ( FFR ) , coronary flow reserve ( CFR ) and IMR will be measured before and after PCI using coronary pressure - / thermistor - tipped wire ( Radi Pressure Wire Certus , St Jude Medical , Uppsala , Sweden ) . Maximal hyperemia will be achieved using iv infusion of adenosine ( 140mcg/kg/min ) during the procedure . The pressure wire will be advanced through 6F guiding catheter to position the pressure sensor at a point 10 mm distal to the distal end of the stenosis or the stent after PCI procedure . Three injections of 3ml normal saline at room temperature will be administered via guiding catheter at baseline before starting PCI procedure and at maximal hyperemia . The transit time will be measured as the time that elapses between the moment when one-half of the saline had been injected ( defined as T0 , and determined on the temperature curve from the shaft of the wire ) and the moment when one-half of the saline had passed the sensor . Simultaneous recordings of mean aortic pressure ( guiding catheter , Pa ) and mean distal coronary pressure ( distal pressure sensor , Pd ) will also be obtained at baseline and during maximal hyperemia . FFR will be calculated by dividing the mean distal coronary pressure ( Pd ) by the mean aortic pressure ( Pa ) during maximal hyperemia . CFR will be calculated as a ratio of mean transit time at basal condition ( Tbas ) and after inducing hyperemia ( Thyp ) . The IMR will be calculated using the following equation : IMR = Pa x Thyp [ ( Pd - Pw ) / ( Pa - Pw ) ] , where Pw is the coronary wedge pressure . Pw will be measured as the distal coronary pressure Pd ( from the distal pressure and temperature sensor ) during complete balloon occlusion of the vessel with the angioplasty balloon during PCI . Coronary angiograms will be analyzed offline using a computer-assisted , automated edge-detection algorithm using dedicated software Axiom Sensis ( Siemens , Erlangen , Germany ) by an independent operator not involved in the study or PCI procedure . QCA of the lesion , TIMI coronary flow , TIMI myocardial blush and TIMI frame count before and after PCI will be assessed . Comprehensive echocardiogram with 2D-strain analysis will be done before and immediately after PCI procedure within 30 minutes after its end . After the procedure , the patients who had an uneventful PCI will stay in the hospital for 24 h. Blood samples for Troponin I , creatin kinaze ( CK ) and CK-MB will be collected at 6 , 12 and 24 h after the procedure , and for C reactive protein ( CRP ) after 24h . Complications of the interventions will be documented in the patients study file . Periprocedural myocardial necrosis is defined as rise in troponin I level three times 99th percentile upper limit of reference range , according to definition of myocardial infarction for clinical trials on coronary interventions . After discharge from the hospital patients will be followed according to hospital protocol . Patients will be seen in an office visit 30 days and 6 months after baseline PCI procedure . At 12 months after baseline procedure patients ' vital status will be assessed by telephone interview . Statistical analysis Continuous data will be summarized as the means ± SD . Categorical data will be summarized as counts and percentages . Unpaired t-tests will be used for comparing the continuous variables , if the distribution is normal , and Mann Whitney U test if the distribution is not normal . Chi-squared test and Fisher 's exact test will be used for categorical vari¬ables . Multivariate logistic regression analysis will be performed to determine independent predictors of impaired IMR after PCI . Univariate analysis would be conducted first to identify potential factors for impaired IMR . The likelihood-ratio test will be used , and the variables with a p value < 0.2 would be included in the multivariate model . A p value of p < 0.05 will be considered to be statistically significant . All statistical analyses will be performed with the PASWStatistics 18.0 statistical software ( SPSS Inc , Chicago , Illinois , USA ) .

"The University of Texas Health Science Center, Houston",NCT02104739,Effects of Antidiabetic Medications on the Postprandial State in Prediabetes,"The University of Texas Health Science Center, Houston",4,1,Prediabetes,Drug,Exenatide,Treatment,Quadruple,This project addresses cardiovascular disease risk in patients with prediabetes . Levels of lipids after eating a meal ( `` postprandial lipids '' ) are strong independent predictors of cardiovascular risk . Newer anti-diabetic agents - exenatide and saxagliptin - impact lipid metabolism . These medications will be studied for their effect in reducing both postprandial lipid levels and arterial dysfunction .,"It is a paradox that medical efforts to control blood glucose in type 2 diabetes mellitus have not decreased the risk of cardiovascular disease . Postprandial lipid concentrations are a strong predictor of cardiovascular risk , independent of traditional cardiovascular risk factors . The new classes of antidiabetic medications - GLP-1 agonists and DPP-IV inhibitors - affect lipid as well as glucose metabolism . This study will investigate the efficacy of these medications in reducing postprandial hyperlipidemia , disrupting the concurrent proinflammatory free fatty acid signaling , and ameliorating endothelial dysfunction in individuals with prediabetes . This will consist of a single center , randomized , crossover , placebo-controlled double-blinded prospective trial involving three study arms representing the aforementioned medications : exenatide ( GLP-1 agonist ) , saxagliptin ( DPP-IV inhibitor ) , and placebo ( control arm ) . Each subject will participate in each of the three arms , which are three separate , daylong outpatient studies . For each study arm , subjects will eat a standardized atherogenic high-fat test lunch . Venous blood draws and measurements of forearm blood flow will be done prior to the meal and periodically during a 6-hour period after the meal . Forearm blood flow measurements will assess for changes in endothelial function . The blood will be analyzed for multiple markers of hyperlipidemia and free fatty acid signaling . After completing the three randomized study visits , subjects are invited to participate in an optional , nonrandomized extension study . For the extension study , subjects will take exenatide ER ( extended-release exenatide ) weekly for total of six weeks . Then subjects return to eat a standardized atherogenic high-fat test lunch . Venous blood draws and measurements of forearm blood flow will be done prior to the meal and periodically during a 4-hour period after the meal , for the same analyses described before . The results will provide new insights into the anti-inflammatory effects of multiple antidiabetic medications via the mechanisms of postprandial hyperlipidemia , free fatty acid signaling , and endothelial function in prediabetic individuals .",2014-04-01,"June 1, 2018","Inclusion Criteria : Diagnosis of Prediabetes - defined as either impaired fasting glucose ( fasting glucose of 100-125 mg/dL ) , impaired glucose tolerance ( 2-hour postprandial blood glucose of 140-199 mg/dL after 75 gram oral glucose challenge ) , and/or a hemoglobin A1C ranging from 5.7 % to 6.4 % Subjects are allowed , but not required , to be on statins , ACE-inhibitors , beta-blockers , angiotensin-receptor blockers , thiazide diuretics , and/or loop diuretics at doses that have been stable for at least the last 3 months BMI between 30-35 kg/m2 ( ±1 kg/m2 ) Body weight has been stable ( ±4-5 pounds ) over the prior three months .

This first-in-human study of Prurisol ( abacavir acetate ) is being performed to evaluate the pharmacokinetics , safety and tolerance of a single oral doses of Prurisol administered to healthy volunteers and the bioequivalence to abacavir sulfate ( Ziagen ) . This study will be followed by a 505 ( b ) ( 2 ) Phase 2 trial in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis .","Prurisol™ , abacavir acetate , is an ester of abacavir . Prurisol is believed to act as an immune response modifier in certain conditions , including psoriasis . Abacavir is a synthetic nucleoside analogue . Ziagen , abacavir sulfate , was developed and marketed as a treatment for HIV-1 infection for over a decade . Ziagen inhibits viral DNA synthesis . Consequently , Prurisol is under consideration as a possible new therapy for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis . The nonclinical efficacy of Prurisol has been demonstrated in the human psoriatic skin xenograft model in irradiated severe combined immune deficient mice . Histologic as well as visual observations confirmed a treatment benefit of Prurisol in this animal model . Interleukin-20 ( IL-20 ) is a recently discovered cytokine displaying increased levels in psoriatic lesions , and levels of IL-20 have been shown to decrease with anti-psoriasis treatment and correlate with clinical improvement . IL-20 has been suggested as a specific target in psoriasis treatment . In comparison to vehicle-treated animals , the mice transplanted with human psoriatic tissue and treated with Prurisol had significant reductions in plasma IL-20 levels which were greater than those seen with methotrexate treatment . The expression of PRINS ( psoriasis susceptibility-related RNA gene induced by stress ) was significantly lower with twice daily Prurisol treatment compared to control . This study is designed as an open-label , randomized , 2-period , 2-treatment , 2-sequence , single-dose intensive pharmacokinetic ( PK ) study conducted in healthy volunteers . In addition , a lead-in dosing period will allow the evaluation of the PK of abacavir from 3 escalating single doses of Prurisol ( 50mg , 100mg , 200mg ) . Completion of each dosing cohort will be followed by a 24-hour safety evaluation period before moving to a higher dose . Adverse Events , vital signs , physical examination , and safety laboratory tests ( clinical chemistry and hematology ) from each dosed cohort will be reviewed prior to any dose escalation for next cohort . For each subject completing the first part , there will be a 5 to 21 day washout period before the next dose of study drug . Subjects will be randomly assigned to receive either a single dose of 350mg Prurisol or 300mg of Ziagen in the second dosing period . After a 5 to 21 day washout period , subjects will receive the alternate treatment in the third dosing period . Blood samples for PK analysis will be obtained over a 24 hour period for each dose . Safety and tolerability will be assessed by ascertainment of adverse events , results of clinical laboratory testing and physical examination .",2014-03-24,"October 24, 2018","Inclusion Criteria : Individuals who meet ALL of the following criteria are eligible for participation in this study : Provided written informed consent Male or female adult aged 18-65 years old ( inclusive ) .

This treatment can diminish the amount of disease to very low levels that only very sensitive and specialized techniques can measure ; it does not , however , provide a cure . Dr. Shaoguang Li and colleagues at University of Massachusetts have published a unique discovery that the arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase ( 5-LO ) gene ( Alox5 ) is a critical regulator for LSCs in BCR-ABL-induced CML ( Chen Y et al . Loss of the Alox5 gene impairs leukemia stem cells and prevents chronic myeloid leukemia . Nature Genetics 41:783-792 , 2009 ) . In the absence of Alox5 , BCR-ABL failed to induce CML in preclinical studies . While deficiency in Alox5 had no effect on normal hematopoiesis , impairment of the LSCs function through differentiation and cell division of CML LSCs was observed . This defect led to a depletion of LSCs and a failure of CML development . Treatment with a 5-LO inhibitor ( zileuton ) also impaired the function of LSCs and prolonged survival . These results demonstrate that a specific target gene can be found in cancer stem cells and its inhibition can completely inhibit the function of these stem cells .

National Institutes of Health Clinical Center (CC),NCT02049385,Does Enhanced Glutamate Transporter Function Produce Antidepressant Effects in People With Major Depression?,National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH),1,0,Depression,Drug,Diazoxide,Treatment,Triple,"Background : - At least one third of individuals with major depressive disorder ( MDD ) remain treatment-refractory after receiving currently available antidepressants underscoring the urgent need for new antidepressant therapies . Of the novel pharmacotherapeutic strategies seeking to rapidly alleviate depressive symptoms , glutamatergic modulators have emerged as promising potential targets . The present study sought to examine the potassium ( KATP ) channel activator diazoxide as a possible treatment for MDD . Diazoxide increases glutamate uptake from the synaptic cleft by activating the KATP channel to chronically increase expression of the excitatory amino acid transporter ( EAAT ) -2 system in glial cells . Diazoxide is FDA-approved for the treatment of sulfonylurea-induced hypoglycemia , hypoglycemia due to hyperinsulinemia , and hypertension . Objectives : - To assess the ability of diazoxide , potassium channel activator , to improve overall depressive symptomatology in patients with treatment-resistant MDD currently experiencing a major depressive episode . The efficacy of a three-week course of diazoxide will be compared to three weeks of placebo . The MADRS will serve as the main outcome measure Eligibility : - Adults 18 to 65 years old with MDD who are currently depressed without psychotic features . Design : Study Phase I ( Day -28 to 0 ) : -- Screen and taper off medications ( Days -28 to -14 ) : Prior to consenting to this study , subjects will have undergone a screening consisting of laboratory tests , psychiatric and medical history , and psychiatric and physical examinations under protocol 01-M-0254 , `` The Evaluation of Patients with Mood and Anxiety Disorders and Healthy Volunteers '' . After consenting to this study , patients will be tapered off medications . Medications allowed and not allowed are listed in Appendix 1 . Patients will be reminded to report all drugs , OTC products , and other agents to the investigators so that they can screen to avoid interactions that might make participation unsafe or might confound the research results . Patients are expected to meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria before medications are tapered ( which is usually 1-2 weeks long ) . Subjects who are not taking medications will enter the drug-free period directly . All participants must have a score of ≥20 on the MADRS at screening and baseline of Study Phase I . Subjects who do not have a score of ≥20 on the MADRS by the end of Study Phase I will be excluded and will receive standard treatment . Drug-free period ( Day -14 to day 0 ) : -- Subjects will begin a 2-week drug-free period prior to the administration of diazoxide or placebo . Study Phase II ( Day 0 to 56 ) : In this study phase , subjects will be blindly randomized to receive either diazoxide 200-400 mg/day ( given BID ) or a placebo administered daily by mouth for three weeks . All patients except those who have a 50 % or greater decrease in MADRS from baseline at the end of the first cross over point will cross over . To avoid carry-over effects between the different test sessions , there will be an interval of 14-21 days , pending response to test session 1 . Subjects will then be blindly crossed over to the second experimental condition ( either diazoxide or placebo ) for another three weeks . All subjects who discontinue the study or who complete study phase II will then receive either clinical treatment or the opportunity to participate in another research protocol . Patients maintaining response to treatment condition 1 after two weeks will receive an additional one week washout before being crossed over to condition 2.The total duration of the study is approximately 11-13 weeks . The duration of Study Phase I including the 14-day drug-free period is approximately 4 weeks . Study phase II is 8-9 weeks long . Thus , the total duration of the study is approximately 11-13 weeks , except for those patients who were unmedicated at time of entry into the study and therefore do not need to undergo the initial tapering off medications . Subjects will be required to be hospitalized during the entire study . Passes will be permitted if the subject is clinically stable and the pass does not interfere with the study or unit procedures .","Objective : To date , available pharmacological treatments for major depressive disorder ( MDD ) have proven to be only modestly effective during the acute phase . We have been systematically testing different glutamatergic modulators in patients with mood disorders in order to develop improved therapeutics . A recent report found that the ( beta ) -lactam antibiotic ceftriaxone increased glutamate uptake by increasing GLT1 ( EAAT2 ) function and had antidepressant-like effects in animal models . Using the learned helplessness model of depression we developed outbred lines , defined a new anatomy of helplessness , and determined that synaptic loss due to excess extracellular glutamate appears to be involved in the pathophysiology of helplessness ; these animals show a 40 % decrease in EAAT2 astrocytic transporter expression . Together , these data suggest that astrocytic glutamate reuptake systems may be central to the pathophysiology and treatment of depression , and that agents that directly increase astrocytic glutamate uptake may represent a novel class of antidepressants . With this protocol , we propose to test a specific new mechanism that uses diazoxide to chronically increase expression of the glutamate transporter EAAT2 , resulting in removal of glutamate from the synaptic cleft . Diazoxide enhances glutamate uptake in glia by activating ATP-sensitive potassium ( KATP ) channels . We expect that this effect will reduce excessive glutamate transmission and be associated with acute antidepressant effects . The model presented here is a clinically testable one . If successful , it may lead to the development of a group of novel pharmacological treatments for major depressive disorder . Study Population : 24 individuals with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder . Design : Male and female patients diagnosed with MDD , ages 18 to 65 years , currently experiencing a major depressive episode , will be recruited for this study . The study will comprise the double-blind crossover administration of either diazoxide ( 200-400 mg/day given orally ) or placebo . The study will assess the efficacy of three weeks of a glutamate transporter enhancer ( diazoxide , 200-400 mg/day given orally ) compared with placebo in improving overall depressive symptomatology in patients with treatment-resistant MDD . Other aims of the study include : 1 ) determining whether changes in brain neurochemicals ( glutamate ) correlate with antidepressant response ( as measured by decreases in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) total scores ) in response to diazoxide in patients with treatment-resistant MDD ; and 2 ) examining other potential biomarkers of response . Outcome Measures : Primary : MADRS total score . Secondary outcome measures : proportion of subjects achieving remission ( MADRS score less than or equal to 10 ) and response ( more < 50 % reduction from baseline in MADRS total score ) ; change from baseline in Beck Depression Inventory ( BDI ) , Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale ( HAM-A ) , Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HAM-D ) , Visual Analog Scale ( VAS ) , and the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale ( C-SSRS ) total scores .",2014-01-28,"September 12, 2017","INCLUSION CRITERIA : 18 to 65 years of age .

The objective of this clinical trial is to assess if the experimental treatment is as efficacy as the standard treatment in the anesthetic and analgesic effects with less side effects , greater and earlier mobility after surgery and shortened the hospitalization .","DESIGN OF THE TRIAL : A multicentre , randomized , single-blind , with masked evaluationby third parties clinical trial . The Clinical Pharmacology Unit will perform a permuted blocks randomization scheme for each of the two hospitals participating in the trial . The result of this randomization will be kept in this unit and will not be accessible to investigators . Investigators will receive a series of opaque sealed envelopes with a number corresponding to the order of entry of the patients into the trial . When the patient is in the operating room , investigators must open the envelope which contains the group of treatment assigned to that patient . The patient will not know in which intervention group is included . Investigator who performs the spinal puncture and investigator who collects the data and performs the evaluation will no be the same person . This will allow a blind evaluation . OBJECTIVES : Main objective : To evaluate whether the addition of morphine chloride to a low dose solution of local intradural anaesthetic in patients undergoing hemorrhoids surgery produces an anaesthetic efficacy comparable to that produced by a standard dose of local intradural anaesthetic and an improvement of postoperative analgesic efficacy . Secondary objectives : Earlier mobilization of the patient . Minor adverse effects . A shorter hospital stay of the patient . TREATMENTS : Two groups of treatment will be formed , experimental and comparator . The experimental group will receive 3mg of Bupivacaine with addition of 50 micrograms of Morphine Chloride . The comparator group will receive 5 mg of Bupivacaine . RESCUE TREATMENTS If necessary before surgery , midazolam will be administered from 0.02 to 0.05 mg / kg intravenous ( IV ) depending on clinical response and after the patient is set in the surgical position , if necessary , an intravenous infusion of propofol will be administered at 0.5 - 2mg / kg / h. Sedative drugs with analgesic effects as opioids , ketamine , etc , will be avoided to not interfere with the main analgesic study assessment . After surgery and during the hospitalization stay the rescue analgesia treatment will be administered only on demand . The rescue treatment allowed by protocol will be an intravenous administration of dexketoprofen up to 50 mg / 8 h and if insufficient , a rescue of 3 mg of morphine chloride will be administered . If morphine chloride is received , these patients will be recorded in the case report forms as inefficacy of the treatment . At home , after discharge , patients will receive rescue analgesia with capsules of dexketoprofen 25 mg / 8 h. ( up to 75 mg a day ) . SAMPLE SIZE : 66 patients ( 33 patients in the experimental group and 33 patients in the control group ) EFFICACY ASSESSMENT Pain will be assessed using a visual analog scale ( VAS from 0 to 10 ) at the beginning and end of surgery , at the arrival of resuscitation unit , after 10 and 30 minutes after arrival , during hospitalization stay out of the resuscitation unit and daily at home after discharge . Doses required of rescue analgesia and hospitalization time will be recorded . SAFETY ASSESSMENT Basic monitoring as usual will be perfomed in the surgery room . Motor blockage will be assessed using the modified Bromage scale as follows : 1 = complete motor blocking , 2 = able to move feet only , 3 = patient move the feet and bend the knee , 4 = straight leg raises 30 ° but not against resistance , 5 = lifts leg > 30 ° against resistance .

Wake Forest University Health Sciences,NCT02040116,Study Evaluating Rapid Infusion Rituximab in Patients With Autoimmune Diseases,Wake Forest University Health Sciences,4,1,Multiple Sclerosis,Drug,Rituximab Infusion,Treatment,,The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of rapid infusion rituximab on the incidence of infusion-related reactions in patients with Autoimmune Diseases .,"Background Rituximab is a human/murine monoclonal antibody targeted at the CD20 antigen ( cluster of differentiation antigen 20 ) on B-lymphocytes . The CD20 antigen is expressed in over 90 % of B-cell non-Hodgkin 's lymphomas . B cells are also believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of other oncologic and non-oncologic disorders . Targeting B cells appears to have a role in decreasing autoimmune and inflammatory processes , as well as antibody production in many autoimmune diseases . Rituximab is approved for the treatment of non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( NHL ) , chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) , rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) in combination with methotrexate , wegener 's granulomatosis , and microscopic polyangiitis in combination with glucocorticoids . Although rituximab is not approved for multiple sclerosis , myasthenia gravis , or other autoimmune diseases , it is commonly used later in the treatment course for patients that are not responding to other treatment options . Rituximab 's main limitation is the occurrence of infusion-related reactions ( IRR ) . These reactions can include fever , chills , rash , respiratory compromise , and a variety of other symptoms , including death . The incidence of IRR is known to vary depending on the rituximab indication . The incidence of IRR with the first infusion of rituximab is approximately 77 % with NHL , 27 % with RA , and 12 % with wegener 's granulomatosis and microscopic polyangiitis . The incidence of IRR decreases with subsequent infusions of rituximab to approximately 5-10 % . According to the National Cancer Institute , there are 5 grades of IRR . In general , grade 1 reactions are classified as asymptomatic or only mild symptoms that do not require intervention . Grade 2 reactions are classified as moderate with minimal , local , or noninvasive interventions required . Grade 3 reactions are classified as severe and medically significant , but not immediately life-threatening . These reactions require hospitalization or prolongation of a current hospitalization . Grade 4 reactions are classified as life-threatening with urgent interventions required . Grade 5 reactions are classified as death related to an adverse drug event . The incidence of IRR is a chief concern for patients , nurses , and other healthcare providers . The package labeling recommends the administration of a standard infusion of rituximab for all patients initiating rituximab therapy to minimize IRR . If this infusion is tolerated then subsequent infusions may be titrated up to a faster rate to decrease infusion time . Based on the manufacturer 's package insert , rituximab is infused at a rate of 50 mg/hr and can be increased every 30 minutes by 50 mg/hr ( maximum rate of 400 mg/hr ) . If a grade 3 or 4 IRR does not occur , subsequent infusions are given at a rate of 100 mg/hr and can be increased every 30 minutes by 100 mg/hr ( maximum rate of 400 mg/hr ) . The average infusion time is estimated to be 4-6 hours for the first infusion , and 3-4 hours for subsequent infusions . Rituximab is typically given in cycles and the timing will vary depending on the indication .",2014-01-14,"August 7, 2018","Inclusion Criteria : Autoimmune patient at Wake Forest Baptist Health that is eligible for rituximab therapy Tolerate the standard infusion rituximab with ≤ grade 2 hypersensitivity reaction Consent to participate in the rapid infusion study Age ≥ 18 years ≤ 80 years Exclusion Criteria : Tolerate the standard infusion rituximab with ≥ grade 3 hypersensitivity reaction Neurocognitive impairment ( i.e . dementia , Alzheimers , et al )",19,0,18 Years,80 Years

In PGP , the endurance capacity for standing , walking and sitting is diminished . The diagnosis of PGP can be reached after exclusion of lumbar causes and must be reproducible by specific clinical tests . While various pain mechanisms including mechanical , hormonal , inflammatory , and neural have been proposed in the development of PGP , the etiology and pathogenesis is poorly understood . It is possible that musculoskeletal changes influenced by hormonal ( Relaxin ) elevation in pregnancy predispose pregnant women to acute musculoskeletal injury presenting clinically as PGP . An inflammatory response in other acute musculoskeletal injuries has been well described3 and may also occur in pregnancy related PGP particularly given the musculoskeletal vulnerability during this time . Though PGP is common in pregnancy , no study to date has investigated the efficacy of anti-inflammatory treatment in pregnancy related PGP in order to better establish the contribution of inflammation in the etiology of pregnancy related PGP .",2014-01-17,"July 11, 2018","Inclusion Criteria : Women who are not doing other therapies for pain ( physical therapy , chiropractic management , pool ) Women between age 21 and 50 who plan to deliver at Loyola or Gottlieb Pain Numeric Rating Scale ( NRS ) on average of greater than or equal to 5/10 at Visit 1 Pain must be between the upper level of the iliac crests and the gluteal folds in conjunction with or separately from pain in the pubic symphysis and influenced by position and locomotion 2/4 positive physical examination tests on the symptomatic side including the P4 test , the LDL test , pubic symphysis palpation and the acute straight leg rise ( ASLR ) Exclusion Criteria : Women presenting with PGP in the first or third trimester ( 28 weeks gestation ) Women with pubic symphysis ( anterior ) pain alone Women who do not plan to deliver a baby at Loyola or Gottlieb Pain above the upper level of the iliac crest History of lumbar or pelvic fracture , neoplasm , inflammatory disease , active urogenital infection or active gastrointestinal illness , current physical therapy or other therapies for PGP , or previous surgery of the lumbar spine , pelvic girdle , hip joint or femur History or signs of radiculopathy or other systemic neurologic disease Women with diabetes or gestational diabetes",2,1,21 Years,50 Years

These children are at high risk for developing invasive fungal disease due to their compromised immunity and associated variable degree and duration of neutropenia . Currently , children who receive micafungin are given daily or alternate day dosing . The investigators will give a ONE TIME dose of micafungin and draw PK levels up to 96 hours post-infusion . The investigators goal is to obtain comparable micafungin drug concentrations at the end of 96 hours ( 4 days ) as compared to lower dose at every 24 hour dosing . The investigators dosing proposal is likely to be effective prophylaxis for immunocompromised patients and would broaden its applicability to larger populations .","Disseminated fungal infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised children . Many of the drugs used for fungal prophylaxis have been associated with renal and hepatic toxicity . Also , breakthrough infections have been reported with the use of some of the oral agents due to poor oral absorption . An alternative approach is the use of intravenous micafungin for fungal prophylaxis . Micafungin has a distinct advantage due to its better safety profile , specifically in terms of hepatic and renal toxicity . Currently , children who receive micafungin are given daily or alternate day dosing ( based on their last Pk study , Mehta et al 2010 ) . The investigators objective is to examine the pharmacokinetics of micafungin when it is given on a less frequent schedule . The investigators hypothesize that a single dose of micafungin ( at 5mg/kg ) every 4 days will provide drug exposure equivalent to daily dosing ( at 1mg/kg ) while reducing administration costs and improving patient convenience ( with essentially twice a week dosing regimen ) . Both animal and adult data support the use of this approach . Fifteen patients will be enrolled on this study and will be given a SINGLE DOSE of micafungin antifungal prophylaxis ( 5 mg/kg ) . Blood samples will be drawn for pharmacokinetic measurements after administration of micafungin .

Seattle Children's Hospital,NCT02054156,OPTIMIZing Treatment for Early Pseudomonas Aeruginosa Infection in Cystic Fibrosis,Bonnie Ramsey,3,1,Cystic Fibrosis,Drug,azithromycin,Treatment,Quadruple,The purpose of this trial is to compare the effects of treatment with tobramycin solution for inhalation ( TIS ) with and without azithromycin in people with cystic fibrosis ( CF ) age 6 months to 18 years who have early isolation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( Pa ) from a respiratory culture . Specimens of blood and sputum or throat swabs will be taken during the study along with pulmonary function testing . Participants will receive initial treatment with TIS followed additional treatment with TIS if quarterly respiratory cultures are positive for Pa in addition to either azithromycin or placebo for 18 months .,"Cystic fibrosis ( CF ) lung disease begins in the first few months of life and follows a course of recurrent lower airway bacterial infection and inflammation and progression of disease over years and decades at a variable pace . With the development of chronic lung infection , obstructive disease progressively worsens , ultimately leading to respiratory failure . Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( Pa ) is the most important pathogen infecting the CF lower airways , and its acquisition early in life is associated with a pro-inflammatory effect , lower lung function , poor nutritional outcomes , and decreased survival . Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( Pa ) infection of the cystic fibrosis ( CF ) airway typically proceeds from early infection to chronic infection . Although some studies have shown that a minority of individuals with CF spontaneously clear early Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( Pa ) infection , data from multiple studies suggest that antibiotics are superior to no treatment in clearing Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( Pa ) from respiratory cultures . Understanding the transition period from early to chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( Pa ) infection is thus of critical importance in identifying strategies to prevent this progression . The study will assess the clinical and microbiologic efficacy and safety of azithromycin given three times weekly in combination with standardized tobramycin solution for inhalation ( TIS ) therapy among children with early Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( Pa ) . TIS therapy is defined as an initial eradication treatment with 1-2 courses of 28 days TIS and subsequent 28 day treatments only at times a quarterly respiratory culture is positive for Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( Pa ) . Eligible participants will be randomized within one month of their Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( Pa ) positive culture to receive one of the following two treatment strategies for 18 months : ( 1 ) oral placebo in addition to standardized TIS therapy , or ( 2 ) oral azithromycin in addition to standardized TIS therapy . At the first study visit , participants will undergo a physical examination and a review of their medical history . Lung function will be measured via spirometry ( in children greater than four years of age who are able to perform spirometry ) , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) testing will be conducted , and hearing ability will be measured via audiometry . Blood will be drawn for laboratory tests and a specimen will be obtained for a respiratory culture before randomization and study drug dispensing occurs . Subsequent study visits will take place at Day 21 , Weeks 13 , 26 , 39 , 52 , 65 , and 78 . At each visit , participants will undergo a physical examination , a spirometry test ( as appropriate ) , a respiratory specimen for Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( Pa ) culture will be collected and study drug will be dispensed ( except at Week 78 ) . Participants will complete self-report or parent-completed respiratory symptom questionnaires and signs and symptoms evaluations will be performed at all visits .

Assistance Publique - Hôpitaux de Paris,NCT02052154,Multicenter Pilot Study Evaluating the Immunogenicity of an Innovative Pneumococcal Vaccination Strategy in Splenectomized Adults,Assistance Publique - Hôpitaux de Paris,2,1,Splenectomized Patients,Biological,Prime-boost pneumococcal immunization,Prevention,,"Evaluate the immunogenicity of an innovative pneumococcal vaccination strategy in splenectomized adults comprising 1 dose of Prevenar13® conjugate vaccine ( PCV ) at M0 followed by 1 dose of Pneumo23® or Pneumovax® polysaccharide vaccine ( PPSV ) at M2 . Duration of follow-up of 36 months . The main endpoint will be the proportion of subjects responsive to 9 of the 13 serotypes common to the PCV and PPSV vaccines , selected because of their frequency in invasive infections in adults in France and their potentially reduced susceptibility to penicillin ( serotypes 1 , 3 , 6A , 7F , 9V , 14 , 19A , 19F , 23F ) .","The splenectomized patient is more susceptible to infections because of the lack of specific response to the polysaccharide antigens that compose the capsules of certain bacteria . These very severe infections are known as Overwhelming Post Splenectomy Infections , or OPSI ; they are characterized by very rapid onset with no prodrome and carry a high mortality rate . The annual incidence of OPSI is estimated at 0.23-0.42 % with a lifetime risk of 5 % . The role of pneumococcus in particular has been clearly established in these infections . The most effective strategy to minimize the risk of pneumococcal infection is pneumococcal vaccination . Currently there are two types of vaccines available in France : polysaccharide and conjugate , both of which induce the production of anti-capsular IgG with both neutralizing and opsonic activity . Since one of the consequences of asplenia is the absence of IgM production elicited by a polysaccharide challenge , due to an absence of splenic B cells , it is difficult to imagine that such patients would mount a satisfactory immune response to PPSV vaccination . And in fact , several studies have described the occurrence of pneumococcal OPSI in patients who were correctly vaccinated . The study hypothesis is that a vaccination strategy combining PCV vaccine followed by PPSV vaccine will induce a good immune response in splenectomized patients , with good tolerability . All available data suggest that the optimum schedule consists of a primovaccination with one dose of PCV followed two months later by one dose of PPSV , in order to achieve a T-dependent memory response to the 13 serotypes common to the two vaccines . The proposed endpoint is therefore to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of a vaccination strategy comprising priming with one dose of Prevenar13® PCV vaccine ( serotypes 4 , 6B , 9V , 14 , 18C , 19F , 23F , + 1 , 3 , 5 , 6A , 7F , 19A ) to induce a T cell memory response , followed by the classical administration of one dose of Pneumo23® or Pneumovax® vaccine ( serotypes 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6B , 7F , 8 , 9N , 9V , 10A , 11A , 12F , 14 , 15B , 17F , 18C , 19F , 19A , 20 , 22F , 23F , 33F ) . Secondary endpoints will evaluate the safety of this strategy in terms of post-immunization local and systemic side effects , frequency of invasive pneumococcal infections , predictors of immunogenicity , and persistence of immunogenicity 30 months post-immunization .",2014-01-20,"December 3, 2020","Inclusion Criteria : Age ≥ 18 years and ≤ 75 years Splenectomized since at least 2 weeks , with Howell-Jolly bodies on a blood smear and ultrasonographic confirmation No immunosppressived conditions : mainly trauma , idiopathic thrombocytopathic purpura or autoimmune hemolytic anemia , with no active treatment Available for 37 months of follow-up starting from the screening visit Contraception that the investigator judges effective for the first 2 months of the trial , with a negative pregnancy test Women not planning to become pregnant in the 6 months following inclusion ( M0 ) Signed informed consent Exclusion Criteria : Pregnancy or planned pregnancy in the 2 months following inclusion ( M0 ) Pathology or conditions which modify immune response ( excluding splenectomy ) : HIV infection , immunosuppressive therapy ongoing or in 6 months before inclusion ( M0 ) , including corticosteroids > 10 mg daily , topic inhaled or dermic corticoid treatments are allowed , hematopoietic stem cell allo / autograft , primary immune deficiency , nephrotic syndrome , sickle cell disease , evolutive neoplasia History of anaphylactic reaction following vaccination Known allergy to any of the ingredients of the vaccines : aluminium phosphate , phenol , Corynebacterium diphtheriae CRM-197 protein Previous vaccination with 7-valent or 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ( in the 5 last years ) Previous vaccination with the pneumococcal polysaccharidic vaccine in the 3 years before inclusion ( M0 ) Other vaccination in the month before inclusion ( M0 ) Polyvalent immunoglobulin infusion in the 3 months before inclusion ( M0 ) or during the planned duration of the study Anticoagulant treatment current or stopped less than 7 days before inclusion ( M0 ) ; or clotting disorder contra-indicating intramuscular injection Participation to an other vaccine study in the 28 days before inclusion till the end of study Not covered by national health insurance ( beneficiary or assignee )",70,0,18 Years,75 Years

We are trying to see if blocking the nerves in the broken arm results in better pain control and less side effects than injections of morphine into a vein after surgery for a broken elbow .,"Written consent will be obtained by the investigators prior to the surgical procedure using the Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) approved consent form . The medical record will be examined and the use of any analgesic medications in the 24 hours prior to the procedure will be recorded . Patients will be taken to the OR and anesthetized using standard procedures of the Texas Children 's Hospital ( TCH ) department of anesthesia , including monitoring according to the American Society of Anesthesiologists guidelines ( EKG , pulse oximetry , BP , temperature and end-tidal expired carbon dioxide and inhalation anesthetic gases ) . If the Attending Anesthesiologist believes the child is at risk for aspiration of gastric contents , a rapid sequence induction with propofol 3-4 mg/kg and succinylcholine 1mg/kg IV will be performed with cricoid pressure , in keeping with standard practices . In other patients an IV will be started after induction of anesthesia . An age appropriate endotracheal tube or appropriate sized laryngeal mask airway ( LMA ) will be inserted in all patients . Anesthesia will be maintained with sevoflurane , nitrous oxide and oxygen , adjusted to keep blood pressure and heart rate within 20 % of baseline values , in keeping with standard practices . All patients will receive ketorolac 0.5mg/kg IV . Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio into one of two study groups : ultrasound guided supraclavicular block or IV opioids , based on a computer generated random number by using Random Allocation Software For Parallel Group Randomized Trials . The assignment will be made only after written informed consent has been obtained . There will be an equal chance a child will be assigned to one of the two groups . Patients randomized to the systemic analgesia group will receive 1mcg/kg of fentanyl IV after induction . Patients randomized to the supraclavicular block group will receive an ultrasound guided nerve block with 0.2 ml/kg ropivacaine 0.5 % ( maximum 10 ml ) , using the technique described by Marhofer et al . In order to decrease variance in success rates , the ultrasound guided nerve block will be performed by 1 of the 4 anesthesiology co-investigators , each of whom have successfully performed over 100 ultrasound guided blocks in the past . Supraclavicular blocks were performed using the higher frequency of the probe and placing it in a coronal-oblique-plane in the supraclavicular fossa . The brachial plexus will be identified as a cluster of hypoechoic nodules , lateral to the round pulsating hypoechoic subclavian artery and lying on top of the hyperechoic first rib . The cupola of the lung will be identified . If the transverse colli artery is visualized cephalically surrounding the plexus , the probe will be moved toward a better coronal oblique plane , directing the ultrasound beam slightly caudally , in order to keep the artery away from the plexus . The needle will be was carefully introduced using an in-plane ( IP ) technique from lateral to medial , toward but not into the brachial plexus . The entire needle image will be visualised at all times to ensure it does not enter the vessel , nerve plexus or pleura . The spread of local anesthetic to all targets of the plexus will be observed on the ultrasound image . The time taken to place the block will be recorded from the time the ultrasound probe is first placed on the child until completion of local anesthetic injection . The observer collecting postoperative data will not be present when the block is placed , and a band-aid will be placed over the supraclavicular fossa in all patients to maintain blinding of the observer to the group assignment . During the operation patients can receive intraoperative fentanyl , 1 mcg/kg IV at a time , if the attending anesthesiologist believes it is clinically indicated . At the end of the operation , anesthetic gases will be discontinued while the patient breathes 100 % oxygen . The trachea will be extubated when the patient responds to commands , and the child will then be taken to the Post Anesthetic Care Unit ( PACU ) in keeping with standard practices . A validated pain scale ( verbal rating scale where 0 = no pain and 10 = worst possible pain ever ) will be used throughout to assess the severity of pain in the postoperative period . In keeping with current practice , patients with pain scores > 4 will be treated with morphine 0.05mg/kg IV at 10 minute intervals until the score is below 4 . Oral acetaminophen with hydrocodone ( Lortab elixir 0.15mg/kg hydrocodone ) will be administered to children for pain scores between 2- 3 . Supplemental oxygen , rescue antiemetic and antipruritic drugs will be administered in keeping with standard practices of TCH and the clinical judgment of the Attending Anesthesiologist . The duration of supplemental oxygen therapy , any medication administered and complications ( side effects such as nausea , vomiting , itching , respiratory depression , prolonged awakening ) will be recorded on the case report form . The blinded observer will record pain scores within 15 minutes of arrival in the PACU and at 30 minutes , 1,2,6,12,24 , and 48 hours after arrival in the PACU . If the child is sleeping at this time , the scores will be recorded when awake . Prior to discharge home , parents will be educated on use of the 0-10 pain scale and given a diary to keep an accurate record of postoperative pain issues through the study period . The goal is to capture maximum pain scores at rest and with movement .

Baylor College of Medicine,NCT02056301,A Comparison Trial Between PCA and Epidural Analgesia for Pectus Excavatum Repair,Baylor College of Medicine,4,0,Pectus Excavatum,Drug,Hydromorphone,Treatment,Single,The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of epidural and IV analgesia in controlling pain in patients undergoing Nuss repair of pectus excavatum . The primary end point will be the mean pain score during postoperative days 0-4 .,"Pectus excavatum is a cartilaginous deformity that is the most common congenital anterior chest wall defect in children [ 1 ] . Children with this disease process often complain of dyspnea , decreased exercise tolerance , and shortness of breath implying a restrictive pulmonary deficit [ 2 ] . Besides the reported physical limitations , patients can also exhibit manifestations of psychological disturbances ( poor body image and depression ) . Surgical repair has been correlated with enhanced quality of life and improvement in body image [ 3 ] with recent studies showing improved pulmonary function and cardiac output [ 4 , 5 ] . Surgery initially introduced by Sauerbruch involved rib cartilage resection and sternal osteotomy . This open procedure was further modified and became [ 6 ] known as the Ravitch procedure . This was the mainstay for repair for over 40 years until the introduction of minimally invasive surgery without rib resection by Nuss and colleagues in 1987 [ 7 ] . The Nuss repair involves placing an intrathoracic brace through small lateral chest wall incisions aided by thoracoscopy . Similar to bracing the teeth , the Nuss procedure avoids osteotomy or rib cartilage resection [ 8 ] . The Nuss procedure is the most common minimally invasive procedure in use today to correct this condition and is the current standard of surgical practice . Complications from Nuss repair can range anywhere from 7 % to 25 % [ 9 ] and can occur for as long as the bar is in place . Pain control remains a major issue in the perioperative period as patients may require weeks to months of oral narcotics before becoming pain-free after correction of the pectus . A prospective multicenter study reported peak pain scores of 8 on a 0-10 scale in the postoperative period and a mean score of 3 at discharge [ 4 ] . Postoperative pain after pectus repair has been managed with IV opioids administered by patient controlled analgesia ( PCA ) devices and by thoracic epidural infusions of combinations of local anesthetics and opioids . It is unclear from published data which method is superior and different tertiary care centers in the USA have a preference for different methods .",2014-02-04,"June 1, 2020",Inclusion Criteria : Patients age 8- 18 years 2 ) Patients undergoing minimally invasive pectus excavatum repair via Nuss procedure 3 ) American Society of Anesthesiology Status I-III Exclusion Criteria : 1 ) Refusal of epidural catheter 2 ) Pregnancy 3 ) Bleeding History 4 ) Inability to understand how to use the PCA device 5 ) Medication interfering with blood coagulation 6 ) Patients allergic to local anesthetics 7 ) Patient refusal to participate in study 8 ) Developmental delay,62,0,8 Years,18 Years
Pierre Fabre Medicament,NCT02054338,A Study of Vinflunine Plus Gemcitabine Versus Paclitaxel Plus Gemcitabine in Patients With Advanced Breast Cancer,Pierre Fabre Medicament,3,0,Advanced Breast Cancer,Drug,Vinflunine+Gemcitabine,Treatment,,The combination of vinflunine and gemcitabine in advanced breast cancer in comparison to paclitaxel and gemcitabine is based on the following points : the significant antitumour activity of vinflunine in metastatic breast cancer ( MBC ) as single agent after anthracycline-taxane exposure and recent phase I study results of the vinflunine plus gemcitabine is at least additive and both drugs have a distinct mechanism of action ; since taxanes have been approved in the adjuvant setting and are widely used in the treatment of early breast cancer it is worthwhile to assess new combination chemotherapy regimens as first line therapy for metastatic breast cancer .,"This is a randomised , multicentre , open-label phase III study comparing antitumour efficacy of vinflunine plus gemcitabine versus paclitaxel plus gemcitabine , as first line treatment for patients with unresectable , locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer after prior anthracycline-based adjuvant chemotherapy . Patients with metastatic breast cancer are incurable using conventional therapy with antitumoural hormonal drugs or cytostatic agents . The median survival from diagnosis of metastatic disease to death is reported to be approximately 3 years . While newer chemotherapeutic agents have been able to achieve tumour shrinkage , no significant increases in overall survival have been demonstrated so far . One reason for this result may be that breast cancer has a longer disease time span than NSCLC , allowing for administration of multiple therapies with different modalities . These therapies confound overall survival regardless of whether the treatment is a first-line or a subsequent treatment . The combination of gemcitabine plus paclitaxel has demonstrated improvement in overall survival over paclitaxel alone as first line therapy in patients with locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer , however , this study compared single agent versus combination chemotherapy . Using overall survival as a primary endpoint in a trial Using overall survival as a primary endpoint in a trial comparing 2 different cytostatic combinations in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer requires a large phase III study to detect a clinically significant difference . The advantages with such an endpoint are that it is technically easy to monitor and it is not dependent on monitoring tumour status . However , since patients with breast cancer typically receive 3 or more lines of chemotherapy , it becomes difficult to assess the impact of a first-line therapy on overall survival ( as proposed herein ) due to the potential for confounding effects from later treatments . A more specific instrument -if closely monitored- is progression-free survival . This endpoint reflects the impact of a specific treatment modality on the disease at a given time period and is probably confounded neither by prior treatments nor by subsequent therapies . Progression-free survival also represents an important clinical achievement for patients with metastatic breast cancer .",2014-01-31,"August 9, 2019","Inclusion Criteria : female patients 18 years or older but less than 75 years old histologically/cytologically confirmed breast cancer documented locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer HER-2 negative or unknown prior neo- and/or adjuvant anthracycline-based chemotherapy measurable or non-measurable disease according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) 1.0 adequate haematological , hepatic and renal functions ECG without any clinically relevant abnormality Exclusion Criteria : known or clinical evidence of brain metastases or leptomeningeal involvement history of second primary malignancy patients having as sole tumour lesion : malignant effusion , lymphangitis , cystic lesion , bone lesion , and any other lesion not assessed by imaging techniques or colour photography pre-existing motor/sensory grade > 1 peripheral neuropathy prior therapy with vinca alkaloids and/or gemcitabine history of severe hypersensitivity to vinca alkaloids and/or gemcitabine or contraindication to any of these drugs pregnancy or breast feeding",1004,1,18 Years,75 Years
Philogen S.p.A.,NCT02054884,F16IL2 Plus Paclitaxel in Metastatic Merkel Cell Carcinoma,Philogen S.p.A.,2,0,Merkel Cell Carcinoma,Drug,Arm A: F16IL2 in combination with paclitaxel,Treatment,,"There is no standard treatment for Merkel cell carcinoma ( MCC ) , as no randomized trials have been conducted to establish standard of care . Despite a sizable number of objective responses induced by combination cyototoxic chemotherapy , a prolongation of patients overall survival has never been demonstrated . This open-label , randomized , double-arm , multi-centre , phase II study of F16IL2 in combination with paclitaxel versus paclitaxel monotherapy , proposes to test the therapeutic efficacy of F16IL2 plus paclitaxel in patients with metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma , who are not amenable to surgery . A total of 90 patients with Merkel cell carcinoma will be enrolled and treated during the study ; 45 patients will receive the combination treatment of F16IL2 and paclitaxel ( Arm A ) , and 45 patients will receive paclitaxel monotherapy ( Arm B ) .","F16IL2 has been studied in two clinical pase I/II trials in patients with different advanced cancer types . One of them ( Nr . EudraCT : 2007-006457-42 ) tested the administration of therapeutic doses of paclitaxel ( up to 90 mg/m2 on a weekly basis ) together with escalating doses of F16IL2 ( from 5 Mio IU of IL2 equivalents in a weekly administration schedule , until definition of MTD ) . More than 40 patients were treated in this clinical trial . As of today , the highest F16IL2 dose tested corresponds to 45 Mio IU , but the dose escalataion of the F16IL2/paclitaxel combination study is still ongoing . In general , treatment of patients with F16IL2 plus paclitaxel was very well tolerated not exceeding the expected toxicity of chemotherapy alone . Multiple objective and durable tumor responses were observed in the F16IL2/paclitaxel combination trial ( particularly in patients with non small cell lung cancer or melanoma who had previously failed several lines of chemotherapy ) . In addition to several disease stabilizations of previously progressive patients . Paclitaxel promotes the assembly of microtubules from tubulin dimers and stabilizes microtubules by preventing depolymerisation . This stability results in the inhibition of the normal reorganization of the microtubule network that is essential for vital interphase and mitotic cellular functions . In addition , paclitaxel reduces abnormal arrays or bundles of microtubules throughout the cell cycle and multiple asters of microtubules during mitosis . F16 is a human recombinant antibody fragment in the scFv ( single chain Fragment variable ) format that is directed against tenascin C , an angiogenesis marker common to most solid tumors independent of the tumor type . ScFv ( F16 ) selectively localizes in tumor tissues in animal models as demonstrated both histologically and during mechanistic studies involving mice transfected with orthotopic human tumours . IL2 , the human cytokine interleukin-2 , is a potent stimulator of the immune response . It has a central role in the regulation of T cell responses and effects on other immune cells such as natural killer cells , B cells , monocyte/macrophages and neutrophils ( Smith , 1988 ) . IL2 can induce tumor regression through its ability to stimulate a potent cell-mediated immune response in vivo ( Rosenberg , 2000 ) .",2014-01-31,"May 15, 2018","Inclusion Criteria : Patients with advanced or metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma ( MCC ) not amenable to surgery and who have not received previous systemic therapy with taxanes ; diagnosis of MCC must be histologically confirmed ( evaluation of primary lesions or advanced disease ) and endorsed by the IMMOMEC central dermatopathology center ( central review of diagnosis at the Department of General Dermatology , Medical University of Graz ) .

The treatment has never been used in humans before . The treatment foresees the use of two compounds : AvdinOX and [ 177Lu ] DOTA-biotin . AvidinOX is a new compound , essentially a natural protein obtained from hen eggs , while [ 177Lu ] DOTA-biotin is a new chemical compound resulting from the combination of the DOTA-biotin ( also deriving from a natural vitamin which is biotin ) with the 177Lutetium , an atom which emits radiation . AvidinOX will be injected directly into the metastases in the liver and [ 177Lu ] DOTA-biotin will be injected into the arm vein . One specific property of AvidinOX is that it chemically links to the tumor tissues when it is injected while maintaining the capacity to take up [ 177Lu ] DOTA-biotin . Once locally bound in tumor tissue , AvidinOX becomes an `` artificial receptor '' for intravenously injected [ 177Lu ] DOTA-biotin , which allows an internal radiation therapy of the tumor tissue . The treatment of liver metastases with local injection of AvidinOX and the following intra-venous injection of [ 177Lu ] DOTA-biotin could be simpler and more tolerable than the current available treatments .","Primary objectives To identify the Maximum Tolerated Dose ( MTD ) of 177Lu-ST2210 after prior intra-lesional injection of AvidinOX in the liver .

University of Dundee,NCT02053519,Can Vitamin D Supplementation Improve Hepatitis C Cure Rates,University of Dundee,3,1,Hepatitis C,Drug,Active Comparator: Vigantol Oil (Vitamin D3),Treatment,Quadruple,"Evidence suggests that vitamin D may be directly or indirectly a co-factor for the efficacy of Hepatitis C virus , ( HCV ) , antiviral therapies . The level of vitamin D necessary for optimum immune function is ill defined and many of those with HCV infection in Scotland are below these levels . Vitamin D is a cheap and safe medication , so its addition to anti-viral therapy should be highly cost-effective even if only a modest increase in SVR was achieved . Given the Scottish HCV epidemic , the world leading government response to it and the nationally low vitamin D levels , Scotland is perfectly placed to answer this question . Therefore the investigators hypothesize that vitamin D supplementation will improve SVR and propose a randomised controlled trial to test this hypothesis . The anticipated end of study date for this study is April 2015","Hepatitis C is a major health problem for Scotland with greater than 1 % of the population infected ; the Scottish Government has recognised this and mounted the Hepatitis C action plan , recognised as the world leading public health response to the epidemic . The key aim of this is to expand treatment access and numbers of patients cured of HCV infection to prevent patients developing the complications of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma . The success of treatment for HCV depends on genotype and is measured by the Sustained Viral Response ( SVR ) . The SVR is the absence of virus 24 weeks after end of treatment and has been shown to be a cure of infection . The FDA has recently suggested SVR can be assessed at 12 weeks , in clinical trials . Scotland has an equal mix of genotype 1 & 3 HCV infection accounting for greater than 95 % of those infected . Treatment involves Pegylated Interferon injections weekly and Ribavirin twice daily for 6 months for HCV genotype 3 infection , with an SVR of 70 % . For genotype 1 infection treatment is with the above dual therapy with the addition of a protease inhibitor , for treatment duration of 6-12 months leading to SVR rates of 65-70 % . There are an increasing number of new pharmacological products in advanced development that will be available for clinicians to use but these , as well as increasing efficacy , will increase cost . So it requires clinicians to make treatment as effective as possible . Vitamin D has traditionally been associated with bone health , with definite deficiency causing osteomalacia and making a contribution to osteoporosis . The traditional , currently used normal ranges for Vitamin D are based on prevention of bone diseases . Recently and controversially it has been suggested that low normal levels of vitamin D are associated with multiple other disease states , including cancer , infection and cardiovascular disease Additionally it has been suggested that many of the normal population in Scotland are vitamin D deficient . Other studies have shown that drug users , a high risk group for HCV infection have similarly deficient levels of vitamin D. Studies have suggested that up to 92 % of those with chronic liver disease have vitamin D levels below that deemed acceptable physiologically to maintain health . Some data is now available to support the role of vitamin D supplementation in the treatment of hepatitis C and improving SVR rates . Several observational studies have found an association between low vitamin D levels and reduced SVR rates , and additionally one study has shown an association between a single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) in vitamin D binding protein and treatment response . A small Israeli trial of vitamin D supplementation in HCV treatment has shown increased SVRs in those supplemented , but the study had a number of flaws including a failure of randomisation ( 13 ) . Additionally there have been an abstract and a letter report of improved outcome with a vitamin D intervention . Biological mechanisms of interaction between vitamin D and the immune system have been explored . It has been shown that Vitamin D plays a role in the regulation of innate immunity , macrophage function , and cell mediated immunity Vitamin D receptors ( VDR ) are also expressed on many effector cells of the immune system ; activated T and B cells , macrophages and monocytes which act to increase to enhance phagocytic action and interferon activity , it has also been suggested vitamin D has a direct effect on HCV . These give a biological basis for the effect of vitamin D on the success of antiviral therapy . A randomised controlled trial , to be successful , requires recruitment and retention of subjects in the trial . HCV infection is associated with chaotic lifestyles which might impair the rate of recruitment and retention , although the Scottish HCV clinical database audit clearly shows that , with all comers , routine HCV care in Scotland matches the results from the randomised clinical trials . This pilot study will also help determine the recruitment and retention rates for a larger trial in this population .",2014-01-16,"October 25, 2016","Inclusion Criteria : Participants will be eligible if they Have confirmed hepatitis C with positive PCR for genotype 1 or 3 Are planned to commence on standard eradication therapy for HCV Aged 18 or over Exclusion Criteria : Exclusion criteria are : Hepatitis C genotype other than 1 or 3 Contraindications to interferon / ribavirin therapy eGFR < 30 ml/min ( by MDRD4 method ) Currently decompensated liver disease o Ascites , encephalopathy or variceal bleeding History of renal calculi Serum calcium 2.60 mmol/L History of sarcoidosis , metastatic malignancy Hepatocellular carcinoma ( current or previous ) Taking > 400 units/day of vitamin D HIV positive Pregnancy Breastfeeding Of childbearing potential and not taking reliable contraception Unable to provide written informed consent",72,0,18 Years,80 Years

University of Padova,NCT02056210,Stem Cell Mobilization With Plerixafor in Diabetic vs Control Subjects,University of Padova,4,1,Diabetes,Drug,Mozobil,Treatment,,"The objective of this study is to assess whether there are differences in the mobilization of CD34+ cells and EPC in response to Mozobil in patients with diabetes mellitus compared to subjects without diabetes . Currently , there are no non-invasive methods for the study of bone marrow function in humans . This project aims to evaluate in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus the ability to mobilize CD34+ cells and EPC from the bone marrow to the periphery in response to the exogenous mobilizing agent AMD3100 / plerixafor ( Mozobil ) , compared with a group of non-diabetic individuals . While it has been recently shown that diabetic patients do not respond to mobilization induced by G-CSF ( Filgrastim ) , the investigators herein hypothesize that diabetic patients can adequately respond to mobilization induced by Plerixafor","Scientific background . Diabetes mellitus is associated with an increased prevalence and incidence of cardiovascular diseases . It is believed that the high cardiovascular risk in diabetes is attributable to the adverse effects of glucotoxicity and lipotoxicity on endothelial cells . Recent data indicate that endothelial repair mechanisms play an important role in determining the integrity of the endothelium and thus the global health of the cardiovascular system . Data from our research group demonstrated that the cells involved in endothelial regeneration and neo-angiogenesis ( including CD34+ cells and endothelial progenitor cells , EPC ) are reduced in number and dysfunctional in patients with diabetes mellitus . EPC belong to the CD34+ cell population and are defined based on the co-expression of endothelial-lineage markers , such as VEGF receptor 2 ( VEGFR2 or KDR ) . These cells are further impaired in diabetic patients with cardiovascular disease . It is believed that these changes represent one of the causes of cardiovascular damage in diabetes . The mechanisms underlying the decrease of EPC and other progenitor cells in diabetes are not fully understood . Normally , EPC reside in the bone marrow and their circulating levels in peripheral blood are very low . In response to ischemic injury or vascular damage , EPC are mobilized from the bone marrow to peripheral blood . Data obtained in experimental models of diabetes mellitus indicate a defect in EPC mobilization from the bone marrow to the peripheral circulation in response to ischemia , which results in an impairment of the post-ischemic neo-angiogenetic processes . Similar experimental results were obtained by different research groups . Our data also show that experimental diabetes reduces the marrow response to exogenous mobilizing agents such as G-CSF and SCF . Other clinical data in humans from our and other research groups confirm the hypothesis of a defect in the bone marrow of patients with diabetes mellitus . In particular , diabetes causes profound alterations of the bone marrow microenvironment associated with microangiopathy and alteration of the stem cells niche . These results confirm a study in the mouse model of type 1 diabetes , in which it was for the first time identified a specific form of microangiopathy causing depletion of CD34+ cells and EPC in the bone marrow . As a consequence of this bone marrow damage , our research group has recently shown that the mobilization of CD34+ cells and EPC phenotypes is profoundly defective in patients with type 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus . To reach this conclusion , the investigators used a test of bone marrow reserve by administering low dose human recombinant G-CSF ( Filgrastim ) . The study showed that a sub-maximal marrow stimulation is able to highlight differences between diabetics and non-diabetics and is absolutely safe , since there have been no significant side effects . In a hematology context , it was also previously shown that diabetes is a factor predictive of `` poor mobilization '' exposing patients to an increased risk of failing stem cell collection for autologous stem cell transplantation . From a functional/mechanistic standpoint , it has been demonstrated that an impairment of the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis probably contributes to the lack of mobilization of bone marrow stem/progenitor cells associated with diabetes . The drug AMD3100 / plerixafor ( Mozobil ® ) is a direct antagonist of CXCR4 and inhibits the cellular signal keeping stem / progenitor cells within the bone marrow . For this reason , AMD3100 / Plerixafor is rapidly effective for the mobilization of bone marrow stem cells . From an experimental point of view , it was observed that diabetic animals , although not responsive to mobilization induced by ischemia and G-CSF , are responsive to mobilization induced by AMD3100 / Plerixafor . Mozobil is currently approved in Italy for stem cell mobilization in patients with multiple myeloma or lymphoma for the purpose of auto-transplantation , in combination with G-CSF , in poorly mobilizing patients ( see SmPC ) . At this stage , the effectiveness of Mozobil in inducing mobilization of stem / progenitor cells in diabetic patients has not yet been tested . Scientific question . The objective of this study is to assess whether there are differences in the mobilization of CD34+ cells and EPC in response to Mozobil in patients with diabetes mellitus compared to subjects without diabetes . Currently , there are no non-invasive methods for the study of bone marrow function in humans . This project aims to evaluate in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus the ability to mobilize CD34+ cells and EPC from the bone marrow to the periphery in response to the exogenous mobilizing agent AMD3100 / plerixafor ( Mozobil ) , compared with a group of non-diabetic individuals . While it has been recently shown that diabetic patients do not respond to mobilization induced by G-CSF ( Filgrastim ) , the investigators herein hypothesize that diabetic patients can adequately respond to mobilization induced by Plerixafor . Plausibility and clinical relevance . It is believed that alterations of stem/progenitor cells secondary to a bone marrow defect contribute to the development of clinical diabetic microangiopathy and macroangiopathy . For this reason , it is of great interest to explore the mechanisms causing an progenitor cell defects in diabetes and the possible strategies to cope with this . A wealth of data coming from animal , human and epidemiologic studies indicate that the mobilizing response to G-CSF is impaired in diabetic patients . Therefore , stem mobilization in diabetes has to be considered an `` unmet clinical need '' . On the other side , preclinical experimental data in animal models of diabetes indicate that AMD3100 / Plerixafor is able to mobilize stem and progenitor cells . The clinical relevance of the project lies in the possibility to identify a treatment able to restore stem/progenitor cell mobilization in diabetes . This can have favorable implications for chronic diabetic complications , such as microangiopathy and cardiovascular diseases . In fact , this project is relevant from a pathophysiological point of view , since it is believed that EPC should protect against vascular complications of diabetes . Furthermore , from a hematologic standpoint , being aware that diabetic patients are hyporesponsive to G-CSF whilst responding adequately to Plerixafor would allow to individualize mobilization protocols in view of an autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation . Expected adverse events . Treatment with Mozobil in combination with G-CSF may be associated with mild adverse events ( see SmPC ) . Compared to placebo + G-CSF , the use of Mozobil + G-CSF in patients from two clinical trials induced a significantly higher number of grade 1-2 adverse reactions : diarrhea ( 37 % vs 17 % ) , nausea ( 34 % vs 22 % ) , flatulence ( 7 % vs 3 % ) , injection site reactions ( 34 % vs 10 % ) , dizziness ( 11 % vs 6 % ) . No side effects of grade 3-4 were reported . In the present study Mozobil will be given as monotherapy , ie not in combination with G-CSF . Based on literature data , adverse events that may be expected with this type of treatment are mild : In a study of 20 healthy volunteers grade 1 side effects were reported in response to a monotherapy treatment with Mozobil sc : cramps or bloating , flatulence , dry mouth . In a study that involved 10 healthy volunteers treated with Mozobil sc monotherapy the following mild side effects were observed ( grade 1 ) : erythema or itching at the site of injection , headache , perioral paresthesia , nausea , abdominal swelling . A study that involved 25 healthy donors treated with Mozobil sc monotherapy reported the following adverse events of grade 1 ( mild ) : dizziness , nausea , flatulence , discomfort or feeling of warmth at the injection site , perioral paresthesias , sweating , cephalea . On the basis of these data , it can be assumed that the use of Mozobil monotherapy is safe and expected side effects are mild and tolerable for the patient . In addition , as with almost all drugs , Mozobil can induce allergic reactions and anaphylaxis .",2014-02-03,"October 22, 2014","Inclusion criteria : Diabetes mellitus ( type 1 or 2 ) ( for the patients ) or absence of diabetes mellitus and other carbohydrates metabolism alterations ( for the non diabetic controls ) Age 20-65 years ; Both genders ; Informed consent .

Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai,NCT02115256,Study to Evaluate is ECV Success is Improved and the Side Effects Reduced With the Use of IV NTGL Versus Terbutaline,Yaakov Beilin,2,0,External Cephalic Version,Drug,Intravenous Terbutaline,Treatment,Double,"Breech presentation of a term pregnancy is a common occurrence . A procedure known as external cephalic version ( ECV ) is frequently used by obstetricians to turn the baby into the vertex position prior to delivery in order to avoid a cesarean section and the associated risks . Medications to relax the uterus , known as tocolytics , are used in conjunction with the procedure as they have been shown to improve the success rate of ECV , but with inconsistent , varying results .","Breech presentation occurs in approximately 3-4 % of all births and all women with breech presentation at term undergo cesarean delivery . The only way to avoid a cesarean is to manually turn the baby prior to the date of delivery , a procedure known as elective external cephalic version ( ECV ) . ECV has been shown to reduce the frequency of breech presentation at term and thus lessen the risks associated with breech delivery and those of cesarean section , with little risk to the mother or baby . Tocolysis , administered immediately prior to the ECV and commonly used at The Mount Sinai Hospital , has been shown to improve the success rate of ECV . Several different agents are known to cause tocolysis . These include beta-mimetics ( ritodrine , terbutaline ) , nitroglycerine ( NTGL ) and nifedipine.Terbutaline has been shown to improve success rate of ECV . Another study published in 2004 by El-Sayed et al showed that subcutaneous terbutaline was associated with higher rates of successful ECV than IV NTGL in term patients . There is inconsistent data in regard to the success rate of ECV with NTGL . In a study published in 2003 by Bujold et al , NTGL was associated with a higher rate of side effects and a lower rate of successful ECV when compared to ritodrine . Another study published in 2009 by Hilton et al showed that NTGL was more efficacious for ECV in nulliparous versus multiparous women . Yet another study published in 2009 by Yanny et al showed no differences between sublingual NTGL versus placebo in efficacy , and reported no significant side effects . A study published in 2003 by Bujold et al showed that sublingual NTGL was associated with a higher incidence of headache and did not improve the success rate of ECV . It may be beneficial to use NTGL instead of terbutaline because NTGL is a shorter acting agent and the procedure itself only lasts 10-15 minutes . Additionally , both medications have side effects . Terbutaline is associated with maternal tachycardia , hyperglycemia , hypokalemia , pulmonary edema , cardiac arrhythmias , hypertension and myocardial ischemia , and NTGL is associated with maternal nausea , vomiting , headache , and hypotension . For both medications the side effects are self- limiting but depending on the patient 's co-morbidities one drug may be beneficial for that individual patient . To date no study has compared the efficacy of intravenous terbutaline versus intravenous NTGL in women presenting for ECV . The purpose of this study is to determine if the success rate of ECV can be improved with the use of IV NTGL .",2014-04-13,"May 14, 2017","Inclusion Criteria : Female Between 18-35 years of age 37 weeks gestation Breech presentation Exclusion Criteria : Patients with ruptured membranes Multiple gestation Maternal age ( age > 35 ) With known medical comorbidities ( including hypertension ( HTN ) , arrhythmias , endocrinologic diseases such as diabetes and thyroid disease , scoliosis , asthma ) Allergies to nitroglycerine or terbutaline Prior abdominal or uterine surgery",6,1,18 Years,35 Years
Ottawa Heart Institute Research Corporation,NCT02114528,Anti-arrhythmic Therapy vs Catheter Ablation as First Line Treatment for AICD Shock Prevention,Ottawa Heart Institute Research Corporation,4,0,Ventricular Tachycardia,Drug,Antiarrhythmic Drug Therapy,Treatment,,The purpose of this study is to determine whether catheter based ablation is better than conventional anti-arrhythmic drug ( AAD ) therapy for reducing recurrent shocks in patients with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator ( ICD ) . The second purpose of the study is to determine the safety of catheter-based ablation and the effect on quality of life of patients . The study hypothesis is that catheter ablation is superior to AAD therapy in preventing recurrent ventricular arrhythmia in such subjects . This is a pilot trial which will provide data regarding recruitment potential and the feasibility of conducting a larger trial .,"AAD and catheter ablation have been shown to reduce the incidence of recurrent AICD shocks . The disadvantages of AAD include side effects from medications and the lack of compliance during long-term therapy . Previous trials have demonstrated the feasibility , safety and efficacy of catheter ablation as `` first-line '' treatment for reducing recurrent ventricular arrhythmia and AICD shocks in this subject population . However , these catheter ablation trials did not systematically compare the efficacy of catheter ablation with AAD therapy . While both treatment strategies have been shown to be effective in this setting it is unclear how they compare with each other in preventing AICD shocks . This is a single centre , parallel group , two-arm , unblinded randomized vanguard pilot trial comparing catheter ablation with AAD therapy for preventing recurrent AICD shocks . Eligible and consenting subjects will be equally randomized to receive either AAD therapy or a catheter ablation procedure . A 30-day treatment period will be provided to allow for adequate time to implement the two treatments . Subjects randomized to the antiarrhythmic therapy arm will receive clinically effective loading doses of either sotalol , mexiletine , procainamide or amiodarone ( oral or IV ) alone or in combination , as chosen by the study investigator . Subjects randomized to the catheter ablation arm will undergo the procedure within the 30 treatment period . Concomitant antiarrhythmic therapy with amiodarone or other AAD will be avoided if possible in the ablation group . However , AAD may be used to suppress ventricular arrhythmia resulting in AICD shocks or anti-tachycardia pacing ( ATP ) while waiting for the catheter ablation procedure . Subjects will be seen for a baseline randomization visit , then at 3 , 6 , 9 and 12 months after enrollment and every 3 months thereafter until the end of the study . Subjects will be followed up for a minimum of 12 months and a maximum of 24 months . Quality of life questionnaires will be done at each visit .

In LAM , abnormal , muscle-like cells begin to grow out of control in the lungs . As a result , air ca n't move freely in and out of the lungs . In some cases , this means the lungs ca n't supply the body 's other organs with enough oxygen . This study is being conducted to find out what dose of a drug called saracatinib is best tolerated by people with LAM . This drug has been tested in patients with certain types of cancer but is not currently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) . Saracatinib may work in cancer by preventing the growth , movement and invasiveness of cancer cells . The use of saracatinib to treat LAM is considered experimental . Preliminary testing already completed suggests that the study drug , saracatinib , may suppress certain substances in the lungs of patients with LAM thus may be effective in slowing down the disease process","Tuberous sclerosis complex ( TSC ) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in tuberous sclerosis complex 1 ( TSC1 ) or tuberous sclerosis complex 2 ( TSC2 ) tumor suppressor genes . TSC is characterized by tumors in a wide range of tissues , seizures , mental retardation , autism , and organ failure . Lymphangioleiomyomatosis ( LAM ) , the major pulmonary manifestation in women with TSC , is a progressive lung disease characterized by infiltration of atypical smooth muscle like cells and formation of cysts . The long term goal of this research is to devise novel therapeutic strategies for patients with LAM . Our preliminary data reveal an increase in active Src in lung tissues of patients with LAM as well as in laboratory cultured cells . The focus of this study is to examine if Src inhibition represents a potential therapeutic strategy in LAM . In this study , we will evaluate the safety , tolerability of Src inhibition in subjects with LAM . The Quality Assurance ( QA ) plan is put forth in the Manual of Operations for this study . This study is utilizing the services of the Data Coordinating Center ( DCC ) at the University of Southern Florida .

State University of New York at Buffalo,NCT02111447,Post Anesthesia Emergence and Behavioral Changes in Children Undergoing MRI,State University of New York at Buffalo,4,0,Delirium on Emergence,Drug,Propofol,Prevention,Double,"Children who receive general anesthesia may become agitated ( emergence delirium ) in the recovery period . This occurs more often after inhalational anesthetics , particularly sevoflurane and desflurane than after propofol . However , agitation after anesthesia in children may be difficult to distinguish from pain ; accordingly studies are ideally designed during MRI to obviate the contribution of pain during emergence . Airway complications have been reported after LMA and isoflurane more commonly than with IV propofol and nasal prongs . Whether the airway complications were due to the LMA or the isoflurane was unclear . Therefore , this study was designed to study the incidence of 1. agitation after sevoflurane compared with IV propofol and 2. airway complications after LMA or nasal prongs .","180 children , ASA physical status 1 or 2 will be recruited for elective MRI scan . Randomized after consent is obtained to one of four groups . Anxiety will be assessed preoperatively using the modified Yale preoperative anxiety scale .

National Institutes of Health Clinical Center (CC),NCT02111863,Immunotherapy Using 41BB Selected Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes for Patients With Metastatic Melanoma,National Cancer Institute (NCI),2,0,Melanoma,Drug,Aldesleukin,Treatment,,"Background : The National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) Surgery Branch has developed an experimental therapy that involves taking white blood cells from patients ' tumors , growing them in the laboratory in large numbers , and then giving the cells back to the patient . These cells are called Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes , or TIL and we have given this type of treatment to over 100 patients . In this study , we are selecting a specific subset of white blood cells from the tumor that we think are the most effective in fighting tumors and will use only these cells in making the tumor fighting cells . Objective : The purpose of this study is to see if these specifically selected tumor fighting cells can cause melanoma tumors to shrink and to see if this treatment is safe . Eligibility : - Adults age 18-70 with metastatic melanoma who have a tumor that can be safely removed . Design : Work up stage : Patients will be seen as an outpatient at the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) clinical Center and undergo a history and physical examination , scans , x-rays , lab tests , and other tests as needed Surgery : If the patients meet all of the requirements for the study they will undergo surgery to remove a tumor that can be used to grow the TIL product . Leukapheresis : Patients may undergo leukapheresis to obtain additional white blood cells . { Leukapheresis is a common procedure , which removes only the white blood cells from the patient . } Treatment : Once their cells have grown , the patients will be admitted to the hospital for the conditioning chemotherapy , the tumor infiltrating lymphocytes ( TIL ) cells and aldesleukin . They will stay in the hospital for about 4 weeks for the treatment . Follow up : Patients will return to the clinic for a physical exam , review of side effects , lab tests , and scans about every 1-3 months for the first year , and then every 6 months to 1 year as long as their tumors are shrinking . Follow up visits take up to 2 days . ...","Background : Autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes ( TIL ) followed by high dose aldesleukin can mediate the regression of bulky metastatic melanoma when administered to a patient following a non-myeloablative but lymphodepleting chemotherapy preparative regimen . In animal models , mixing irrelevant ( non-reactive ) cells with tumor-reactive cells negatively impacts on tumor treatment possibly by competing for cytokines , suggesting that enrichment for tumor-reactive cells could enhance clinical efficacy . Additionally , preclinical animal models and clinical investigation have demonstrated that prolonged in vitro culture negatively impacts on tumor treatment . The current method for enrichment of tumor-reactive TIL requires screening of multiple independent TIL cultures for anti-tumor specificity using gamma-interferon production by TIL . However , in vitro screening depends on autologous tumor reagents that are often unavailable , and interferon ( IFN ) gamma release in vitro may not be the best effector function to evaluate tumor recognition . The screen increases the length of in vitro culture times ( 30 days ) , which results in shorter telomere lengths and more differentiated cells . Additionally , selection of a few highly reactive cultures for further expansion may reduce the diversity of cluster of differentiation 8 ( CD8+ ) repertoire recognizing the tumor . 4-1BB is a co-stimulatory molecule up-regulated on the cell surface of T cells upon T-cell receptor ( TCR ) engagement . Pre-clinical studies in the Surgery Branch have evaluated a fast and simplified method to select and expand a diverse tumor-reactive repertoire , regardless of knowledge of the specific antigen recognized , based on selection of 4-1BB expressing TIL from the fresh tumor digest . Objectives : To determine the safety and objective response rate of patients with metastatic melanoma receiving ACT using 4-1BB selected TIL plus aldesleukin treatment following a chemotherapy preparative regimen . To determine the survival of patients receiving this treatment regimen . Eligibility : Patients who are 18 years or older must have : Evaluable metastatic melanoma ; Metastatic melanoma lesion suitable for surgical resection for the preparation of TIL ; No contraindications to high-dose aldesleukin administration ; No concurrent major medical illnesses or any form of immunodeficiency Design : Patients with metastatic melanoma will have a lesion resected and 4-1BB expressing tumor infiltrating lymphocytes will be isolated using a fluorescence-activated cell sorting ( FACS ) sorter approved for clinical use . The 4-1BB selected cells will be rapidly expanded in vitro and administered plus aldesleukin following a non-myeloablative chemotherapy preparative regimen . The study will be conducted using a stage 2 optimal design to determine if this treatment is able to be associated with a clinical response rate that can rule out 10 % ( p0=0.10 ) in favor of a modest 30 % partial response ( PR ) + complete response ( CR ) rate ( p1=0.30 ) . Up to 35 patients may be enrolled over 2 years .",2014-04-09,"August 21, 2017","-INCLUSION CRITERIA : Measurable metastatic melanoma with at least one lesion that is resectable for tumor infiltrating lymphocytes ( TIL ) generation .

University of Lausanne Hospitals,NCT02114489,Study Comparing Ibandronate Versus Placebo in Hip Osteonecrosis,"Brigitte Jolles, MD",3,0,Aseptic Hip Necrosis,Drug,ibandronate,Treatment,Triple,"Aseptic osteonecrosis of the hip ( AOH ) concern 1 Swiss young adult to 1000 ( 30-40 years old ) . They are responsible to a severe joint destruction and in the majority of cases a joint replacement . To the hip , we can distinguish 4 stages of osteonecrosis according to Ficat : 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 . Stage 3 and 4 AOH management are unanimous surgical . But management of stage 1 and 2 are unclear . Bisphophonates are mainly used for bone and osteoporosis diseases . They decrease the bone turn over , and the risk of fracture . They also decrease the bone marrow oedema and the pain associated to this oedema . Ibandronate is a bisphosphonate with a rapid effect , a short half-life , easy to manage , and with few side effects . We designed a double-blind prospective randomized trial aiming to evaluate the efficacy of an infusion of ibandronate versus placebo on pain and AOH progression in patients with stage 1 and 2 AOH . Our hypothesis is that there will be a pain reduction > =20 mm on the VAS scale ( SD 10mm ) in the ibandronate group versus placebo , and a non radiological progression in the treated group .","Aseptic osteonecrosis of the hip ( AOH ) concern 1 Swiss young adult to 1000 ( 30-40 years old ) . They are responsible to a severe joint destruction and in the majority of cases a joint replacement . AOH represented 10 % of the hip replacement in Switzerland . It could be multiple . In this situation , they can be associated with a specific disease , justifying more collaboration between surgeon and specialist on bone diseases or rheumatologist . Initially patient with AOH presents mechanical pain and dysfunction . Either surgeon or rheumatologist can suspect the diagnosis . To the hip , we can distinguish 4 stages of osteonecrosis according to Ficat : 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 . The unfavourable evolution to a worst stage is common and depend on the necrosis surface : less than 10 % at 3 years if the surface is small , 25 % if the surface is moderate , 84 % if the surface is extended . In case of fortuitous discovery , natural evolution to the collapse from stage 1 is 55 % , from stage 2 56 % and from stage 3 96 % with a median time of 39 months . Mainly , in case of early Ficat stage ( 1 ) , the final diagnosis is supported by a specific image on MRI . It could be confounding with a differential diagnosis of transient osteoporosis . Stage 3 and 4 AOH management are unanimous surgical . But management of stage 1 and 2 are unclear . Based on the physiopathology , associating 2 hypothesis ( one vascular , one osseous ) , bisphosphonates could be interesting to decrease the pain and the bone defect whom evaluated to a joint collapse . Bisphophonates are mainly used for bone and osteoporosis diseases . They decrease the bone turn over , and the risk of fracture . They decrease the bone marrow oedema and the pain associated to this oedema . Ibandronate is a bisphosphonate with a rapid effect , a short half-life , easy to manage , and with few side effects . Regarding these considerations , a study gathering surgeons , specialist in bone diseases and radiologist is necessary . An interdisciplinary approach is needed to increase the knowledge in this pathology and to well manage patients . The exact diagnosis of AOH needs a radiologic expertise , the well management of movement and staging evolution needs an orthopaedic management , the deliverance of treatment and bone efficacy of it needs a bone diseases expertise . A prospective randomized double blind with placebo study was designed . All consecutive patients ( 18-50 yo ) seen in OTP and RHU/CMO units of the CHUV with a confirmed diagnosis of a single stage 1 or 2 according to Ficat AOH by an MRI could be included . After informed and signed consent , they will be randomized to receive either placebo or 3 mg of ibandronate . Infusion will be performed in 15 minutes . Size effect ( pain VAS , Harris , Womac , EQ5D , gait parameters , blood analysis ) and side effects will be record at day 3 , 7 , month 1 , 3 , and 6 . If a patient has a persistent pain ( same or worse VAS ) at M3 , a second infusion will be performed , only with ibandronate . At M1 and M3 an MRI will be performed to confirm the stage 1 ( DD transient osteoporosis ) only for the stage 1 previous diagnosed patients . At M3 and M6 an X ray and an MRI will be performed for all patients to analyze the stage progression . The primary end point will be at M6 for pain VAS and radiological progression . Patients who need a second infusion at 3 months would be considered as not survival . We hypothesize a reduction of 20 mm on the VAS scale ( SD 10mm ) in the ibandronate group versus placebo , and a non radiological progression in the treated group . With a power to 90 % and an alpha of 0.05 we want to include 50 patients . Drugs : Patients will be allowed to have pain killers or NSAI prescribe by the investigator or the GP . All drugs have to be noted in the diary . All patients will receive a physiotherapy prescription of one treatment per week , over a period of 3 months . Moreover , the patient may freely choose any physiotherapist . The prescription will be given by the investigator . Furthermore , the sessions can be spaced out during the last three months , at the investigators discretion . On one hand participants will be asked to not overwork . On other hand , participants will be asked to not adapt a non weight-bearing status either . From the economical point of view , looking at the CHUV scale only , 10 % of the hip arthroplasties made for AOH means 30 patients each year . If the treatment allows postponing 10 years the need of an arthroplasty as one study published with a lower methodology suggests , it means an economy of CHF 1'200'000 each year .",2014-04-11,"May 15, 2017","Inclusion Criteria : Signed consent form Male and female between 18 - 50 years old AOH stage 1 or 2 according to Ficat Pain VAS scale > 40 mm ( 0-100 ) Exclusion Criteria : Specific aetiology of AOH already known Cardiac and lung uncontrolled diseases Active malignancy untreated Hyper sensibility or allergy already known to ibandronate Pregnancy or breast feeding Severe kidney insufficiency ( cl < 30 ml/min ) Contra-Indications to an MRI ( Pacemaker , cochlear implant ... )",8,0,18 Years,50 Years

Mustafa Kemal University,NCT02110745,The Effect of Induction Technique on Postoperative Pain and Agitation,Mustafa Kemal University,4,1,"Hernia, Inguinal",Drug,Sevofluorane,Treatment,Double,The objective of this study was to determine ( a ) whether patients anesthetized with intravenous propofol have less pain compared with sevofluorane for paediatric inguinal hernia and undescended testis operations and ( b ) whether intravenous propofol anesthesia has better quality of recovery compared with sevofluorane anesthesia in the immediate postoperative period after paediatric inguinal hernia and undescended testis operations .,"DIFFERENT INDUCTION TECHNIQUES ON AGITATION AND POSTOPERATIVE PAIN IN CHILDREN AFTER INGUINAL HERNIA AND CRYPTORCHIDISM Inguinal hernia and cryptorchidism are probably the most common operations in the paediatric age group . Inguinal hernia is the most common indication for surgery in the paediatric age group and the incidence of inguinal hernia in those younger than 18 years old varies from 0.8 to 4.4 % ( 1 ) . Cryptorchidism is the most common genital anomaly in boys and incidence is 3.5 % of all full- term infants ( 2 ) . Advances in surgical techniques and anesthesia management most of the children can be discharged on the day after these kind of operations ( 3 ) . Most studies of analgesia in pediatric day case surgery have focused on the postoperative pain risk at night , because it becomes the great problem for the parent . Because half of children experience clinically significant pain after discharge according to pain studies done for children ( 4 ) . Volatile anesthetics can activate peripheral neurons that play important role on pain perception in postoperative period ( 3 ) . Zhang et al reported that volatile anesthetics have been demonstrated to have hyperalgesic effects ( 5 ) . In addition the other studies reported that volatile anesthetic induced pain enhancement was mediated by modulation of central adrenergic and cholinergic transmission ( 6 ) ( 7 ) . Also modulation of 5-Hidroxytriptamine3 receptor-mediated currents by volatile anesthetics may also play a role in their pronociceptin effect ( 8 ) ( 9 ) . The recovery profile studies comparing IV propofol anesthesia with inhaled anesthetics have shown a better postoperative analgesia with propofol ( 10 ) ( 11 ) . A recent study Tan et al shown that the patients anesthetized with intravenous propofol anesthesia for surgery had less pain than patients anesthetized with sevofluorane ( 12 ) . A different study by Cheng et al investigating the postoperative analgesic effects of nicotine nasal spray coincidentally found that patients anesthetized with propofol had less postoperative pain than patients anesthetized with isofluorane over the postoperative 24 hours ( 13 ) . Animal studies suggested that propofol suppressed nociceptive behavior . Propofol known to have nociceptive effects by activating transient receptor potential ion channel ( 14 ) ( 15 ) has been demonstrated to have analgesic and antihyperalgesic properties at sedative doses in a human pain model ( 16 ) In normal rat model , propofol has direct actions on the dorsal horn neurons of the spinal cord , which played an important role in the processing of sensory information ( 17 ) In a rat formalin model , propofol produced antinociceptive effect in a dose-dependent manner ( 18 ) . Moreover , subhypnotic doses of propofol has been demonstrated to delay and weaken remifentanil induced post-infusion hyperalgesia in human ( 19 ) . The objective of this study was to determine ( a ) whether patients anesthetized with intravenous propofol have less pain compared with sevofluorane for paediatric inguinal hernia and undescended testis operations and ( b ) whether intravenous propofol anesthesia has better quality of recovery compared with sevofluorane anesthesia in the immediate postoperative period after paediatric inguinal hernia and undescended testis operations . MATERIAL METHODS After obtaining institutional ethics committee approval and written informed consent , 100 American Society of Anaesthesiologists I-II children , aged between 2 and 12 years undergoing elective surgery for inguinal hernia repair and undescended testis were enrolled in the study . The study used a double-blind methodology with random allocation to the two groups by a computer-generated list . All patients ' parents will be instructed on the use of the Wong-Baker Faces Pain scales for pain assessment before the induction of anesthesia . Both of the hands will be applied Eutectic Mixture of Local Anesthetics Cream ( Lidocaine Hydrochloric acid , prilocaine , Astra Zeneca , Istanbul , Turkey ) 60 minutes before the operations by the nurse . All the children were premedicated with midazolam hydrochloride 0.6 mg/kg orally ; maximum 30 min prior to the surgery and we made sure that the drug was given under the tongue to avoid first liver passage . Patients will be monitored in the operating room . Heart rate ( HR ) mean arterial pressure ( MAP ) , and peripheral oxygen saturation ( SpO2 ) were recorded . Patients will be randomized into 2 groups using a computer-generated random number table : the first group will be inducted with iv propofol ( Group P ) and after sevofluorane inhalation will continue , the second group ( Group S ) will be inducted and continued with sevofluorane . Anesthesia was maintained with sevofluorane titrated to a value of 40 bispectrial index . I.Grup 1 : Sevofluorane 8 % mask induction and continue with 2 % sevofluorane I.Grup 2 : Propofol 2.5mg/kg in induction and continue with 2 % sevofluorane Fluid therapy was standardized during and after surgery . During surgery , children received lactated Ringer 's solution 6 ml/ kg/ h whereas 5 % dextrose with electrolytes was given at a rate of 4 ml/ kg/ h in the postoperative period . Induction of anesthesia is performed using oxygen ( FiO2 0.33 ) , nitrous oxide ( FiO2 0.66 ) , and sevofluorane ( increasing concentrations up to 8 % ) administered by mask . After sevofluorane induction intravenous cannula will be inserted . The other group propofol 2.5mg/kg in induction and continue with 2 % sevoflorane . After 0.5 mg/kg rocuronium and 1 mcg/kg fentanyl will be applied before intubation . 5 minutes after induction heart rate , tension arterial , saturation will be recorded . Both of the groups will be maintained with 2 % sevofluorane and 40 % nitrous oxide . All the operations will be done with the same technique by the same surgeon . After spontaneous breathing , the reverse will be applied as 0.03 mg/kg neostigmine ve 0.01 mg/kg atropine intravenous . After reversal of airway reflexes , the patients will be extubated . After extubation the patients will be in postanesthesia recovery room . Operation time , anesthesia time will be recorded . First eye opening , first verbal command follow , staying time in PACU , first analgesic time , ambulation time , first oral intake time , extermination time will be recorded according to the anesthesia completion time . Completion of the surgery , 20 mg/kg rectal paracetamol will be applied as suppository form . However If VAS≥3 then 20 mg/kg paracetamol will be applied in intravenous form . Heart rate , tension arterial , saturation , respiratory rate , agitation scale , Wong-Baker Faces Pain rating scale for pain will be assessed and recorded . If agitation score≥4 then 1mcg/kg fentanyl will be applied intravenously . Wong-Baker Faces Pain rating scale will be taught to all parents and how to sign according to shapes of the faces of all children ( No pain-smiling face to most pain-crying face ) . Transition from PACU to surgical ward was considered safe when patient had achieved a Modified Aldrete Score 9 for at least 10 min , and SpO2 95 % with oxygen 2 l/min or 92 % without oxygen , signified recovery of physical , mental , and physiological function to near preanesthetic levels . Furthermore , 10-point analogue scales were used to measure parents ' satisfaction with their child 's overall anaesthetic and surgical care and satisfaction with their participation in decisionmaking ( 0 . not at all satisfied , 10 . extremely satisfied ) . All adverse events ( bronchospasm , laryngospasm , desaturation , hypotension , bleeding , reoperation ) will be recorded for postoperative 0h ( PACU ) , 10 min , 20 min , 30 min , 40 min , 50 min , 1h , 2h , 4h , 6h , 12h , 24h .",2014-03-26,"March 12, 2015",Inclusion Criteria : American Society of Anesthesiologists I-II 2-12 years old patients Patients for elective inguinal hernia and undescended testis operations .

Radboud University Medical Center,NCT02114255,Effects of BCG on Influenza Induced Immune Response,Radboud University Medical Center,2,1,Influenza Virus Infection,Other,Placebo,Prevention,Quadruple,"In the present study , the investigators want to investigate whether prior BCG-vaccination improves the efficacy of influenza ( `` the flu '' ) vaccination in young and/or old healthy volunteers and consequently could protect against influenza virus infection .","Influenza virus infection leads to millions of cases of severe illnesses worldwide and up to an estimated 500.000 deaths annually . The potential for the sudden emergence of pandemic influenza strains represents an incessant threat on even a larger scale . seasonal influenza vaccination is the backbone of influenza management . However , antibodies generated by vaccination , most often do not effectively neutralize emergent strains due to the high mutation rate of the influenza viral genome . In addition , although vaccination is effective in up to 85 % of healthy adults , only 40-60 % of the elderly are able to mount an protective antibody response due to an agerelated decline in immune function ( so-called immunoscenescence ) . As a result , the protective effects of influenza vaccination are limited , and strategies to improve host immune defenses against influenza virus infection per se , and following influenza vaccination , are highly warranted . It is suggested that prior vaccination with Bacille Calmette-Guérin ( BCG ) could enhance resistance to other infectious diseases in addition to protection to tuberculosis ( TBC ) and , in mice , protection of prior BCGvaccination against influenza infection was demonstrated long ago . However , only recently substantial evidence for these nonspecific beneficial effects of BCG-vaccination in humans has been provided by several randomized clinical trials . Considering these potentiating effects of BCG-vaccination , it could be a viable strategy to improve efficacy of influenza vaccination , and/or enhance immune defenses against influenza virus infection per se . If so , this would have an enormous impact on clinical practice .",2014-03-10,"November 9, 2015","Inclusion Criteria : Age ≥18 and ≤35 yrs Male Healthy Exclusion Criteria : History of influenza vaccination within the year prior to study entry History of BCG vaccination within 5 years prior to study entry History of Mantoux testing within the year prior to study entry Vaccination other than BCG or influenza , within 3 months prior to study or within study period Medical history of any disease associated with immune deficiency Clinically significant acute illness , including infections , within 4 weeks before vaccination Participation in a drug trial or donation of blood 3 months prior to study entry Use of recreational drugs within 21 days prior to experiment day Recent hospital admission or surgery with general anaesthesia ( < 3 months ) Known chronic kidney or liver disease Latent or active tuberculosis infection",40,1,18 Years,35 Years
Universidad Autonoma de San Luis Potosí,NCT02110966,Mepivacaine-Tramadol on the Success of Inferior Alveolar Nerve Block in Symptomatic Irreversible Pulpitis,Daniel Chavarría Bolaños,4,1,Symptomatic Irreversible Pulpitis,Drug,Mepivacaine,Treatment,Double,"The purpose of this study is to evaluate the success of inferior alveolar nerve block , after the local application of Mepivacaine plus Tramadol in patients with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis . Also , to evaluate the duration of the anesthetic effect when using Mepivacaine plus Tramadol in the same anesthetic technique and patients group . Hypothesis : Local application of mepivacaine plus tramadol increases the successful of inferior alveolar nerve block in patients with irreversible pulpitis .","The treatment of pain is an integral part of Endodontics , this must be controlled before , during and after treatment . The inferior alveolar nerve block is the most common anesthetic technique used in mandibular teeth during endodontic treatments . Several studies have reported that it is more difficult to obtain anesthetic success in patients with irreversible pulpitis . There is a 33-80 % of failure in the inferior alveolar nerve block in patients with irreversible pulpitis . Some of the more accepted theories for local anesthetic failure establish that inflammation induce tissue acidosis causing ion traping of the local anesthetics enabling the molecules to cross the cell membrane , also inflammatory mediators may sensitize the neurons by interacting with specific receptors leading to periphery sensibilization . Tissue injury may alter the composition , distribution and activity of sodium channels expressed on nociceptors and this may have profound implications in local anesthetic failure . On the other hand , there is a specific group of tetrodotoxin resistant sodium channels four times less sensitive to lidocaine which increase their activity during inflammation . Some ways to control pain is through pharmacological synergism . Tramadol has been proposed as pharmacological adjuvant to local anesthesia and it can improve the anesthetics success and the duration of the anesthetic effect . However , oral administration of drugs can cause adverse systemic effects , and that 's why local application is an alternative to increase its concentration on the local damaged tissue reducing the possibility of interactions with other drugs and adverse effects . Another advantage of the combination of Mepivacaine with Tramadol is that it reduces the number of injections in patients and it is less traumatic . Tramadol is centrally acting drug but also a local anesthetic and analgesic effect it has been reported . It acts at multiple sites producing different action mechanisms . Some studies suggest that the use of Tramadol can improve the effect of Mepivacaine in the inferior alveolar nerve block . The blockade of the nervous conduction with Tramadol is 80 % more effective if it is compared with some anesthetics like lidocaine . There are few studies evaluating local application of tramadol . In the field of dentistry tramadol using for local anesthetic adjuvant has been studied in oral surgery , so it is important to evaluate it in the field of endodontics to provide better pain management during treatments . Thus , the aim of the study is to evaluate the success of inferior alveolar nerve block with the local application of Mepivacaine plus Tramadol in patients with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis , and also to evaluate the duration of the anesthetic effect when using Mepivacaine plus Tramadol in the anesthetic technique . This study was designed as a double-blind , randomized clinical trial . Following the guidelines suggested by CONSORT group for planning and reporting clinical trials . The ethics committee of the Faculty of Dentistry of San Luis Potosi University approved the study design . All of the subjects will be informed of the possible risk of endodontic therapy and experimental treatments and will sign institutionally approved consents forms . In total 50 patients will be included in this study . The sample size calculation was performed with a Type I error of 0.05 and statical power of 80 % using the difference in duration of anesthetic effect between two groups and taking into account previous studies related to the local effect of tramadol in clinical studies where it is used to assess the time of anesthetic effect . All the subjects voluntarily will presented at the Postgraduate Endodontics Clinic of the Faculty of Dentistry at San Luis Potosi University . The select subjects will have a diagnosis of symptomatic irreversible pulpitis in the first and second mandibular molars . The patients will be diagnosing with the cold test and they will indicate their pain scores using numerical rating scale , this is a 11 point scale where the ends points are the extremes of no pain and the worst pain . Accordingly , no pain corresponded with 0 , mild pain with 1-3 , moderate pain with 4-6 and severe pain 7-10 . The control group will receive the inferior alveolar nerve block using 1.8 ml of Mepivacaine 2 % epinephrine 1 : 100000 and 1.3 ml of Mepivacaine 2 % epinephrine 1:100000 mixed with 0.5 ml of Tramadol ( 50mg/ml ) will be used for the anaesthetic blockade in the experimental group . After 15 minutes , the anesthetic blockade will be assessed by a three step examination : lip numbess , positive/negative response to cold testing and clinical discomfort during endodontic access . Inferior alveolar nerve block success will be defined as the absence of pain during any of these evaluations and if patients report pain an analogue visual scale will be used . Statics normal distribution will be tested by the student 's t test .

This type of therapy is called gene transfer . In this protocol , we are modifying the patient s white blood cells with a retrovirus that has the gene for anti-Melanoma antigen family A , 3 ( MAGE-A3 ) -DP0401/0402 incorporated in the retrovirus . Objective : The purpose of this study is to determine a safe number of these cells to infuse and to see if these particular tumor-fighting cells ( anti-MAGE-A3-DP0401/0402 cells ) cause tumors to shrink and to be certain the treatment is safe . Eligibility : - Adult 's age 18-70 with metastatic cancer expressing the MAGE-A3 molecule . Design : Work up stage : Patients will be seen as an outpatient at the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) clinical Center and undergo a history and physical examination , scans , x-rays , lab tests , and other tests as needed Leukapheresis : If the patients meet all of the requirements for the study , they will undergo leukapheresis to obtain white blood cells to make the anti-MAGE-A3-DP0401/0402 cells . { Leukapheresis is a common procedure , which removes only the white blood cells from the patient . } Treatment : Once their cells have grown , the patients will be admitted to the hospital for the conditioning chemotherapy , the anti-MAGE-A3-DP0401/0402 cells and aldesleukin . They will stay in the hospital for approximately 4 weeks for the treatment . Follow up : Patients will return to the clinic for a physical exam , review of side effects , lab tests , and scans about every 1-3 months for the first year , and then every 6 months to 1 year as long as their tumors are shrinking .","Background : We have constructed a single retroviral vector that contains both and $ < = chains of a T cell receptor ( TCR ) that recognizes the DP0401/0402 restricted Melanoma antigen family A , 3 ( MAGE-A3 ) tumor antigen , which can be used to mediate genetic transfer of this TCR with high efficiency . In co-cultures with HLA-DP0401/0402 and MAGE-A3 double positive tumors , the anti- MAGE-A3- DP0401/0402 restricted ( anti-MAGE-A3-DP4 ) TCR transduced T cells secreted significant amounts of Interferon gamma ( IFN-y ) with high specificity . Objectives : Primary objectives : Determine a safe dose of the administration of autologous cluster of differentiation 4 ( CD4 ) cells transduced with an anti-MAGE-A3-DP0401/0402 restricted ( MAGE-A3-DP4 ) TCR and aldesleukin to patients following a nonmyeloablative but lymphoid depleting preparative regimen . Determine if this approach will result in objective tumor regression in patients with metastatic cancer expressing MAGE-A3-DP4 . Determine the toxicity profile of this treatment regimen . Eligibility : Patients who are human leukocyte antigens ( HLA ) -DP0401/0402 positive and 18 years of age or older must have Metastatic cancer whose tumors express the MAGE-A3-DP4 antigen . Previously received and have been a non-responder to or recurred following at least one first line treatment for metastatic disease . Patients may not have : - Contraindications for high dose aldesleukin administration . Design : PBMC obtained by leukapheresis will be enriched for CD4 cells and transduced with the retroviral vector supernatant encoding the anti-MAGE-A3-DP4 TCR . The study will begin in a standard phase 1 dose escalation . After the maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) cell dose has been determined , patients will be enrolled into the phase 2 portion of the trial at the MTD established during the phase 1 portion of the study . In the phase 2 portion , patients will be entered into two cohorts : cohort 1 will include patients with metastatic melanoma ; cohort 2 will include patients with renal cancer and other types of metastatic cancer . Patients will receive a nonmyeloablative but lymphocyte depleting preparative regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine followed by intravenous infusion of ex vivo tumor reactive , TCR gene-transduced peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) plus intravenous ( IV ) aldesleukin . Patients will undergo complete evaluation of tumor response every 1-6 months until off study criteria are met . For each of the 2 strata evaluated in the phase 2 portion , the study will be conducted using a phase 2 optimal design where initially 21 evaluable patients will be enrolled . For each of these two arms of the trial , if 0 or 1 of the 21 patients experiences a clinical response , then no further patients will be enrolled but if 2 or more of the first 21 evaluable patients enrolled have a clinical response , then accrual will continue until a total of 41 evaluable patients have been enrolled in that stratum . For both strata , the objective will be to determine if the treatment regimen is able to be associated with a clinical response rate that can rule out 5 % ( p0=0.05 ) in favor of a modest 20 % partial response ( PR ) + complete response ( CR ) rate ( p1=0.20 ) .",2014-04-09,"March 2, 2022","-INCLUSION CRITERIA : Metastatic or locally advanced refractory/recurrent cancer that expresses Melanoma antigen family A , 3 ( MAGE-A3 ) as assessed by one of the following methods : Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) on tumor tissue defined as 30,000 copies of MAGE-A3 per 10^6 glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ) copies , or by immunohistochemistry of resected tissue defined as 10 % or greater of tumor cells being 2-3+ for MAGE-A3 , or serum antibody reactive with MAGE-A3 .

Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social,NCT02110810,Indomethacin Decreases Post-ERCP Pancreatitis,Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social,3,1,Post ERCP Acute Pancreatitis,Drug,Indomethacin,Treatment,Quadruple,"Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP ) is now a widely accepted therapy for treating benign and malignant diseases of the pancreatobiliary tree . Acute pancreatitis represents the most common and feared complication following ERCP . The reported incidence of this complication is from 1 % to 40 % according to the presence of high-risk factors for this complication or the presence dysfunction in the sphincter of Oddi ( SOD ) . In most prospective series , the incidence has ranged between 3.5 % and 20 % for nonselected and high-risk patients , respectively . Independent risk factors for post-ERCP pancreatitis are either patient- or procedure-related .","Design This is a randomized clinical trial carried out in patients scheduled for ERCP at the Department of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and Department of Gastroenterology of the Specialties Hospital of the Western Medical Center , in Guadalajara , Jalisco , Mexico . The investigators include patients with an elevated baseline risk of post-ERCP pancreatitis based on prospectively validated patient- and procedure-related independent risk factors . The ERCP procedures are performed with the patient under topical pharyngeal anesthesia with 2 % lidocaine and after administration of sedation ( midazolam ) and analgesia ( fentanyl ) intravenously , with dosages at the discretion of the endoscopist . Patients receive complementary oxygen through an external nasal device at 3 to 5 L/min and infusion of 200 to 500 mL of 0.9 % sterile saline solution . The equipment and protocol that are being used to perform ERCP consist of a video duodenoscope ( Olympus , Tokyo , Japan ) , sphincterotome traction for selective cannulation of the bile duct , a needle scalpel to perform precut sphincterotomy , a hydrophilic guide wire via the bile duct , a Dormia basket and/or balloon catheter for stone extraction , and nonionic water-soluble contrast medium at 300 mg/mL ( Optira 300™ ; ioversol injection 64 % ; Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals , Dublin , Ireland ) for opacification of the biliary and pancreatic ducts . Pancreatic stents are being used only to treat pancreatic fistulas and to prevent pancreatitis . All patients are monitored continuously during the procedure , with determinations of blood pressure , heart rate , respiratory rate , and arterial blood oxygen saturation . Eligible patients who provide written informed consent undergo the randomization at conclusion of the ERCP procedure because patients without risk factors could be included in the study based on procedure-related factors alone . If patients met the inclusion criteria , they are randomly assigned to receive a 100 mg suppository of indomethacin or 2.4 g of glycerin suppository immediately afterwards while still under sedation . All patients are observed to prevent spontaneous expulsion of the suppository until they became completely awake . All patients , staff endoscopists , residents , and researchers are blinded to the treatment assigned to each of them . The following data that is being collected . A clinical history , particularly patient-related risk factors for post-ERCP pancreatitis ; blood test results for the determination of basal amylase , liver enzymes , and bilirubin levels ; as well as results of ultrasonography of the liver and biliary tract . All data generated during the ERCP is being recorded , particularly those related to procedure-related risk factors for developing acute pancreatitis . In addition , other nonpancreas-related complications are being recorded as perforation or bleeding . Any adverse events related to the rectally applied indomethacin or glycerin suppositories are being recorded as expulsion , irritation , or bleeding . Post-ERCP pancreatitis is considered the main outcome variable and is defined as the development of new or increased abdominal pain consistent with pancreatitis , and elevated blood amylase or lipase > 3 times the upper limit of normal until 24 h after the procedure , and hospitalization ( or prolongation of existing hospitalization ) for at least 2 nights . The severity is determined according to consensus guidelines , with mild post-ERCP pancreatitis resulting in hospitalization of less than 3 days , and moderate post-ERCP pancreatitis resulting in hospitalization of 4-10 days . Severe post-ERCP pancreatitis is qualified as resulting in a hospitalization of > 10 days , or leading to the development of pancreatic necrosis or pseudocysts , or requiring percutaneous or surgical intervention . Patients with acute pancreatitis are being followed up for 30 days after hospital discharge . Asymptomatic hyperamylasemia is defined as any amylase level at least three times above the normal serum level in the absence of abdominal pain . Follow up The patients are kept under surveillance in the endoscopy recovery area for 3 h after ERCP . Measurement of serum amylase is determined at 2 h post-ERCP in all included patients . Asymptomatic outpatients are discharged after 6 h of surveillance with monitoring for signs and symptoms of acute post-ERCP pancreatitis by telephone contact for 24 hours . Hospitalized asymptomatic patients are being discharged to their assigned bed after 4 hours of surveillance , where clinical surveillance is continued for up to 24 h. If new abdominal pain suggestive of pancreatic origin appeares at any time , the 2-h amylase level is checked and confirmed with serum lipase determination . All routine laboratory examinations are being performed when acute pancreatitis of any etiology is established . All patients diagnosed with post-ERCP pancreatitis are being managed under the medical care of the Department of Gastroenterology . Patients are being submitted to computed tomography scanning to determine the severity of the episode of pancreatitis . Severity was established according to Cotton 's criteria . Statistical analysis Statistical software , SPSS for IBM ( version 20 for Windows ; IBM Corp. , Armonk , NY , USA ) is beign used for data analysis . The data obtained will be expressed as frequencies and percentages , means and standard deviations . For comparing results , Student 's t test will be used for continuous variables and Chi2 or Fisher 's exact tests will be used for qualitative data when appropriate . Relative risk ( RR ) and 95 % confidence intervals ( 95 % CI ) will be determined as well as the absolute risk reduction ( ARR ) , relative risk reduction ( RRR ) , and number needed to treat ( NNT ) . Statistical significance from two-tailed tests was assumed when p < 0.05",2014-04-07,"March 23, 2015","Inclusion Criteria : If they met one or more of the following criteria : a clinical suspicion of SOD dysfunction ; or a history of post-ERCP pancreatitis , pancreatic or precut sphincterotomy , more than eight cannulation attempts , pneumatic dilatation of an intact biliary sphincter , or ampullectomy Patients were also eligible for inclusion if they met two of the following criteria : aged 50 years or younger and female gender or a history of recurrent pancreatitis ( > 2 episodes ) , three or more injections of contrast agent into the pancreatic duct with at least one injection to the tail of the pancreas , excessive injection of contrast agent into the pancreatic duct resulting in opacification of pancreatic acini , or the need for acquisition of a cytology specimen from the pancreatic duct with the use of a tissue-sampling brush .

Ticagrelor is an oral and reversible inhibitor of P2Y12 receptor . Few information is available about the action of ticagrelor on the molecules involved in thrombogenesis and platelets activation in ACS . The aim of this study is to evaluate the mechanisms of ticagrelor action in vivo . It was observed that patients with myocardial infarction have higher blood levels of microparticles than patients with unstable angina or stable angina . The investigators assumed that ticagrelor benefits are represented by a reduction of microparticle levels , a marker of endothelial dysfunction in patients with cardiovascular disease , and by a modification in microRNAs pattern , fragments of mRNA that have a regulatory action in various cellular processes ( such as proliferation , differentiation , growth and cellular death ) and represent new biomarkers in ACS .","Ticagrelor is an oral , reversibly binding P2Y12 receptor inhibitor that yields , in a dose-dependent fashion , greater and more consistent inhibition of platelet aggregation than standard regimens of clopidogrel in patients with stable atherosclerotic disease and ACS . However , little information is available regarding its complex effect on thrombogenesis and platelet activation in acute coronary syndromes setting . It has been widely demonstrated the potential role of MP in several biologic processes known to take part to pathophysiology of coronary syndromes , such as inflammation , coagulation and apoptosis . Recent studies focused on miRNAs ' regulatory activity of several cellular processes , such as proliferation , differentiation , development , and cell death , and on their role as biomarkers in ACS . The investigators suppose that the observed major efficacy of ticagrelor is related to its actions on MP and microRNAs . Considering the major clinical effectiveness shown by ticagrelor in comparison with clopidogrel , the investigators hypothesize a more pronounced MP levels reduction as a possible mechanism for ticagrelor clinical benefits . Moreover , on the basis of the last evidences of microRNA involvement in the ACS pathophysiology , the investigators aim to assess the effect of ticagrelor on microRNA expression , in order to provide evidences for pleiotropic actions of this drug , which could partially explain its major efficacy in reduction of cardiovascular events in ACS patients . In summary , principal hypothesis of the study are : Considering that ticagrelor is a stronger P2Y12 receptor inhibitor than clopidogrel , the investigators suppose that an increased inhibition of P2Y12 receptor by ticagrelor could reduce circulating levels of platelet and endothelial MP . In consideration of the observed role of microRNAs in expression of P2Y12 receptor , the investigators speculate that patient 's susceptibility to P2Y12 receptor inhibitors could be influenced by microRNAs levels . Moreover , the investigators suppose that ticagrelor could influence microRNAs levels , considered as marker of cardiovascular risk Aims of the study are : to assess MP levels variation in Non ST-Elevation Acute Coronary Syndromes ( NSTE-ACS ) patients treated with ticagrelor in addition to low or high acetyl-salicylic acid ( ASA ) , in comparison with clopidogrel+ASA treatment , to demonstrate that major clinical efficacy of ticagrelor could be partially attributed to its influence on release of MP , that have an important role in coronary instability . to evaluate microRNAs levels variation in Non ST-Elevation Acute Coronary Syndromes ( NSTE-ACS ) patients treated with ticagrelor in addition to low or high ASA , in comparison with clopidogrel+ASA treatment , and to study possible correlations between microRNAs and MP levels , supposing that the ability of ticagrelor in reduced MP level could be related with microRNAs expression .",2014-02-21,"July 25, 2016","Inclusion Criteria : NSTE-ACS Male , 50-80 years old Female , postmenopausal age Exclusion Criteria : Female , premenopausal age autoimmune disease infectious disease neoplasms diabetes chronic renal failure moderate or severe liver insufficiency GRACE risk score > 140 ACS or cerebrovascular accidents in previous three months in-stent restenosis surgery or trauma in previous three months active bleeding fibrinolytic therapy within 24 hours before randomization need for oral anticoagulation therapy an increased risk of bradycardia drugs study hypersensitivity ( including aspirin ) co-administration of ticagrelor or clopidogrel with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors",55,0,50 Years,80 Years

Children's Hospitals and Clinics of Minnesota,NCT02076893,Postoperative Tramadol/Gabapentin/Ibuprofen Versus Tramadol/Placebo/Ibuprofen,Children's Hospitals and Clinics of Minnesota,4,0,Pain,Drug,gabapentin,Treatment,Triple,"Tonsillectomy is the most common pediatric surgical procedure performed in the US , with over 530,000 procedures performed annually in children under 15 years ( Baugh et al. , 2011 ) . The postoperative period can be particularly painful . A recent clinical consensus acknowledges there is no standard analgesic protocol , and calls for further research comparing postoperative pain medications ( Baugh et al. , 2011 ) . Tramadol was found to be as effective as codeine with few reported side effects in a recent double-blinded , controlled trial conducted by the investigators at Children 's Hospitals and Clinics ( CHC ) , and it is currently being prescribed in the postoperative setting . However , despite its effectiveness for pain control , there were some children that continued to report pain during the 10-day follow-up period . In response , the investigators will conduct a randomized , double-blinded controlled trial to determine whether or not adding scheduled gabapentin to a scheduled tramadol + `` as needed '' ( PRN ) ibuprofen regimen provides better pain control than tramadol + ibuprofen PRN alone during the post-tonsillectomy period . Using a 10-day take-home diary , caregivers will be asked to record daily information about their child 's postoperative pain and other core outcomes and domains as recommended in the recent consensus statement put forth by the Pediatric Initiative on Methods , Measurement , and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials ( IMMPACT ) ( McGrath et al. , 2008 ) . This study will offer new information regarding the efficacy and side effects associated with adding scheduled gabapentin to a postoperative pain management protocol in a pediatric population .","Hypotheses H1 : Children who receive scheduled tramadol 1mg/kgQ6h with scheduled gabapentin ( 3 mg/kg/q6h dose ) and PRN ibuprofen will experience better pain relief than children who receive scheduled tramadol 1mg/kgQ6h with PRN ibuprofen following tonsillectomy . H2 : Children who receive scheduled tramadol 1mg/kgQ6h with scheduled gabapentin and PRN ibuprofen will report fewer side effects than children who receive scheduled tramadol 1mg/kgQ6h with PRN ibuprofen following tonsillectomy . This prospective study will include children ages 4 to 15 that are scheduled to undergo a tonsillectomy ( with or without adenoidectomy ) procedure at CHC 's Minneapolis campus with one of the three Children 's Ear , Nose , Throat and Facial Plastic Surgery surgeons . The three surgeons will perform the same standardized surgical technique . The study will be prospective , randomized , and double-blinded . Neither the patient /caregiver ( s ) nor the person ( s ) evaluating the patient postoperatively will know whether the patient was assigned to Group 1 or Group 2 . A random numbers list will be generated to assign sequential patients to Group 1 or Group 2 in order to eliminate selection bias due to group assignment or post-operative evaluation . To minimize any potential risks associated with either tramadol or gabapentin when administered to obese children ( i.e , children at the 85th percentile BMI or higher ) the medication dose will be capped at a rate representing the 85th percentile for the child 's age , sex and height . Caregivers will be advised to administer the scheduled tramadol for five days along with scheduled gabapentin ( or placebo ) for five days . PRN doses of ibuprofen may be administered throughout the 10-day study period . For postoperative days 6-10 , both groups will be advised to switch to a PRN regimen of ibuprofen and tramadol . Caregivers will be advised NOT to administer any study medication if the child shows signs of over-sedation ( respiratory rate lower than normal , slurred speech , etc . ) or vomiting as a result of the study drug , AND will be asked to call the Ear Nose & Throat group in case of severe pain and or side effects ( 24/7 contact information will be provided ) . If the patient displays signs of severe over-sedation ( breathing rate less than 12 breaths/minute , difficulty or inability to be aroused ) parents will be advised to call 911 . If in doubt , the caregiver will be asked to call the 24/7 ENT group phone number . For all adverse events that arise during the study period , both non-urgent and urgent , the first point of contact for families will be with Children 's Ear Nose & Throat and Facial Plastic Surgery . If families contact Children 's pharmacy with any questions related to dosing or side effects , pharmacy staff will either contact Children 's Ear , Nose & Throat and Facial Plastic Surgery themselves or refer the family to do so . For severe adverse events ( respiratory depression , over sedation , seizure , etc . ) and/or the child is seen by a physician due to potential drug side effects , the pharmacist will be authorized to break the blind . If in doubt , the pharmacist can call Children 's Ear , Nose & Throat and Facial Plastic Surgery for guidance . Staff Assessment and Caregiver Diary The following patient and clinical information will be collected by research staff : patient 's age , gender , race , diagnosis ( apnea or chronic tonsillitis ) , concomitant medication use , postoperative pain , and tonsil size rated on a scale of 1 to 4 ( see Appendix I ) . The choice of outcome domains and measures in this study is based on a consensus paper developed by the Pediatric Initiative on Methods , Measurement , and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials ( PedIMMPACT ) expert panel ( McGrath et al. , 2008 ) . Acute pain domains are included in the caregiver diary for this study . A daily diary will be completed by the caregiver and will be used to track the patient 's pain symptoms , side effects , adverse events , and recovery during the first 24 hours and ten days post-surgery . This diary was developed and modified based on feedback received for the diary used in the recent clinical trial ( Friedrichsdorf , unpublished ) . In addition , the research coordinator will contact the caregiver every second day to collect the same data and insure that the diary is completed . The patient /caregiver data will be compared to responses provided during the telephone call in order to validate diary entries . Intensity of pain and discomfort due to pain will be measured utilizing several methods including : a validated pain scale , documentation of use of analgesics and rescue medications , waking from sleep , time to ability to eat solid food , and time to return to normal activity . Other outcome measures include : fluid intake , general satisfaction with treatment , and economic impact of recovery ( e.g. , need for additional outpatient care for throat and/or ear pain , bleeding , nausea , or poor eating ) . In this study , pain self-assessment by the children and adolescents will include the Faces Pain Scale-Revised ( FPS-R ) ( with anchors 0=no pain and 10=highest pain imaginable ) for children ages 4-10 ( Hicks et al. , 2001 ) , and NRS-11 ( with anchors 0=no pain and 10 = highest pain imaginable ) for children ages 11-15 ( note : children age 8-10 years will be asked to choose either the FPS-R or NRS-11 , as both scales are validated for use with children in this middle age range ) . The designated caregiver participating in the study will receive training on pain scale administration . The study coordinator or research associate will call caregivers every two days during the follow-up period to remind them to complete the diary and return it in the postage-paid envelope provided by research staff . Data Requirements and Data Maintenance All paper forms will be stored in a locked file cabinet located in the Pain and Palliative Care department office . Data will be entered into Excel on a secure , password-protected Children 's server and will be exported to SPSS for analysis . The study coordinator will maintain all paper and electronic data . Risks/Benefits Risks There is no additional medical risk associated with post-surgical pain management above and beyond the usual risks . Neither tramadol nor gabapentin pose any known additional safety risk . However , because little has been published in the pediatric literature about these two medications and their application in the postoperative setting , the researchers will form a small Data and Safety Monitoring Committee comprised of Children 's staff members who are not part of the study . This committee will be responsible for reviewing serious adverse events as requested by the researchers ( e.g. , pharmacist , pain expert , etc. ) . As with any study , there is a risk of loss of confidentiality due to the possibility that people outside the study ( e.g. , staff , other families ) may become aware of the child 's participation in the study . The researchers will make every effort to ensure patients ' privacy through use of private rooms for all research-related activities . Paper research forms will be stored in the Pain and Palliative Care office in a locked file cabinet , and all electronic data will be stored on a password-protected file on the Children 's server . Benefits There is a possibility that children who receive tramadol plus gabapentin with PRN ibuprofen during the recovery period will report better pain control , fewer side effects , or both than the children who receive tramadol plus PRN ibuprofen only . Future children and their families may benefit from the knowledge gained from the study in terms of improved pain management during the post-tonsillectomy recovery period . Analysis Analysis Plan The following outcomes will be measured at two , four and 24 hours post-surgery , and then daily for the duration of the follow-up period : Pain : Faces Pain Scale-Revised ( FPS-R ) or Numerical Rating Scale ( NRS-11 ) Postoperative pain : Parents ' Postoperative Pain Measure ( PPPM ) Pre/Postoperative medication use , including any rescue medications Patient- and caregiver-reported side effects Sleep : difficulty falling asleep or difficulty waking Fluid intake Number of patients requiring outpatient care for complications of tonsillectomy including , but not limited to : throat and/or ear pain , bleeding , nausea Parent global satisfaction with treatment , recorded as 0-10 ( 0=Very Dissatisfied to 10=Very Satisfied ) on a visual analog scale . Descriptive statistics will be used to describe the participants and measurement results including frequency distribution for categorical data such as gender and any sleep problem ( Yes/No ) , and mean ( standard deviation ) or median ( range ) for continuous data such as age , fluid intake , pain intensity score and parent global satisfaction with their child 's recovery . The number of days with pain intensity score greater than 4 will be compared between the tramadol/ibuprofen group and tramadol/gabapentin/ibuprofen group using a two-sample t-test or Mann-Whitney test . The PPPM scores and parental global satisfaction with their child 's recovery between two groups will be compared using the two-sample t-test or Mann-Whitney test as well . Eta correlation coefficients will be calculated to examine the relationship between PPPM score and the pain intensity score . Chi-square test or Fisher 's exact test will be used to compare the categorical data between two groups such as percent of patients having any postoperative office visit due to pain/bleeding/nausea and any side effects happened during the postoperative 10 days . A logistic regression model will be fit with 'patients having > 2 days of pain score of > 4 ' as the dependent variable and other factors such as patient age , procedure , medication as independent variables in order to identify clinical factors predictive of postoperative pain following tonsillectomy in children . Sample Size Group sample sizes of 30 and 30 achieve 80 % power to detect a difference of 2 in days with pain score > 4 between the Tramadol group and the Gabapentin group with estimated group standard deviations of 2.7 and with a significance level of 0.05 using a two-sided two-sample t-test . Assuming a 20 % dropout , at least 36 patients will be needed in each group . The researchers plan to enroll at least 80 parents . Environment The study will take place on Children 's Minneapolis campus . Data will be stored in the Pain , Palliative and Integrative Medicine office , currently located in the Medical Doctor 's Building .

Karolinska Institutet,NCT02134600,OmegaChild - Omega-3 Supplementation to Children Previously Treated for Cancer,Per Kogner,1,1,Pediatric Cancer,Dietary Supplement,Omega-3 enriched fruit juice,Supportive Care,Single,"The purpose of this study is to find an optimal dose of omega-3 that can be given to children who have completed cancer therapy . The future aim is to add omega-3 to conventional cancer treatment modalities and thereby hopefully increase the treatment efficacy , which will have to be addressed in subsequent phase-2 studies .","The rationale for this phase-1 trial is to find an appropriate dose of omega-3 for future phase-2 studies . The investigators aim at defining a dose that can safely be given to children previously treated for cancer , and that does not cause unacceptable side effects . In a longer perspective , randomized control trials are planned where the supplement is given for longer periods of time , and in combination with conventional cancer treatment . In preparation for these trials , this dose finding study was designed that also evaluates compliance . Subsequently the investigators hope that this supplementation can be beneficial for children during both cancer treatment and after remission . The study population consists of children judged to be in complete clinical remission from cancer . In a phase 1 trial , one usually uses healthy individuals as study subjects , but in pediatric studies this is not allowed . Therefore patients who are in full remission were chosen as study objects , but who still come to the clinic for regular follow-ups . This group of patients is relevant for this study since it represents all ages and base-line diets , all kinds of childhood cancers , and because they have suffered from cancer and in many cases still live with the severe consequences of it . The study is designed to give five groups of eight individuals each different doses of omega-3 adjusted to body surface area . The first group starts out on a dose of omega-3 fatty acids that is similar to the generally recommended daily intake for adults ( 200-400 mg ) . A dose escalation is then done performed group wise . The highest possible dose in this study ( 2 x 3000mg/day at dose level 3000 mg/m2 to a child at 1.55 m2 , 3871 mg/m2 ) is still lower than what has previously been given as maximum to children in other studies . The investigators will keep escalating the dose level within the study only as long as no unacceptable side effects are reported . The administration is done orally by drinking 200 mL of omega-3 supplemented fruit juice daily . It has a good fruity taste , low amounts of sugar , and no fish flavour . This should facilitate treatment compliance for the children in particular compared to when omega-3 is given in capsules - the commonest choice in other studies , but less suitable for children . Compliance is important and not further jeopardized by trying to divide the fruit juice in less amounts than the whole package , but the individually prescribed dose as well as the actual amount ingested will be recorded and exact calculations used in the analysis of the study . All study results are primarily evaluated on an intention-to-treat basis , but will also be calculated as treated per protocol and further calculated on the exact dose consumed over 90 days given the compliance in terms of consumed number of fruit juice packages .",2014-05-07,"August 27, 2018","Inclusion Criteria : 2-18 years old Diagnosed with and now in complete clinical remission from any type of cancer Completed conventional therapy according to specific protocols within three years Spoken and written Swedish is understood by caregiver and/or child Expected to attend clinical follow-ups the coming three months .

Sleep disorders are especially of interest to be investigated under the perspective of conditioning with drugs , since sleep quality can be defined both in terms of subjective ratings ( self-rated sleep quality parameters ) and objective measures ( via polysomnographic assessment PSG ; e.g. , total sleep time , sleep onset , sleep architecture ) . By using two different drugs ( zolpidem , amitriptyline ) that modulate sleep differentially , the investigators intend to implement a conditioning paradigm in sleep disorders dissociating conditioning effects on subjective and objective sleep parameters . Both drugs should affect objective and subjective sleep parameters positively , while only amitriptyline should modulate the objectively assessed sleep architecture by REM-suppression ( latency of REM-sleep onset , percentage of REM-sleep ) .Patients with mild to moderate insomnia will undergo a classical conditioning paradigm with one of two study medications : amitriptyline or zolpidem .

Methods : Pilot study , clinical type , randomized , prospective , single-blind , in which the investigators compared three schemes for sedation in patients undergoing spinal anesthesia . Keywords : Anesthesia , Spinal Anesthesia , Conscious Sedation , Operating Rooms .","Sedation is a set of actions aimed at achieving a patient be quiet , comfortable , free of pain and / or bad memories as a diagnostic or therapeutic procedure is performed . Given that regional anesthetic techniques frequently used in clinical practice are relatively traumatic and painful procedures , have partnered on multiple occasions sedation , to make such interventions more comfortable for the patient and make it easier to peer collaboration . Not all anesthesiologists use sedation or indicate similarly , but the vast majority practice it . Some apply it consistently before or after puncture for a regional block or in the event that required multiple punctures , and other used only when the patient is anxious . There are various drugs for sedation in anesthesiology with multiple anxiolytic , amnesic , and analgesic to , including barbiturates , benzodiazepines , opioid analgesics , and combinations thereof , are proof of this ketamine , midazolam , fentanyl , propofol , dexmedetomidine , and others . There is a clear need to implement sedation techniques that provide effectiveness , safety and few side-effects as well as low cost to search anxiolysis , amnesia , analgesia and / or drowsiness in patients who are undergoing procedures such as spinal anesthesia . Reducing anxiety and decreased neurological and metabolic response to surgical trauma become a requirement to be treated in the anesthetic plan , sedation there plays a key role in seeking to ensure an adequate hemodynamic stability during locoregional anesthetic techniques under conscious sedation , this being , sedation in which a patient responds normally to verbal stimuli , with preservation of cognitive function and coordination , without alteration of the ventilation or cardiovascular function . The ideal state of sedation depends on the type of patient , type of procedure and the medications used , however it is recommended to maintain a level of sedation between 2 and 3 or conscious sedation , according to Ramsay sedation scale to achieve greater wellness and collaboration , without requiring intervention to keep the airway , while maintaining adequate spontaneous ventilation and cardiovascular function normally held . The objective is to determine the effectiveness of three sedation schemes in patients scheduled to undergo spinal anesthesia . MATERIALS AND METHODS A clinical trial , randomized , prospective , single-blind experimental study was conducted , in which three schemes were compared for sedation in patients undergoing spinal anesthesia . Informed consent was obtained from each of the admitted patients . The study was approved by the ethics committee of the University of Cartagena . Patients who met selection criteria were randomized ( according to a table of random numbers generated on the website : http : //stattrek.com/tables/random.aspx ) to be assigned to one of the research groups , in the period between June 2011 and June 2012 . 3 groups were formed as follows : Group 1 was given midazolam 0.03 mg / kg , Group 2 was applied Midazolam 0.015 mg / Kg + Fentanyl 0.8mcg/kg and in Group 3 was used Midazolam 0,015 mg / Kg + ketamine 0.25 mg / kg , administered as a single dose in all groups . Sample size , with a reliability of 95 % , a power of 80 % and an expected rate of improvement in experimental group of 80 % was calculated , for a total of 75 patients , and were randomly assigned to one of the three study groups , each group consisted of 25 patients . The investigators selected all patients who met the inclusion criteria such as age between 18 and 60 years , scheduled for elective surgery , have pre-anesthetic assessment , be classified according to their risk as ASA I or ASA II , having a body mass index between 18.5 and 29.99 , not be pregnant , have a higher fasting 8 hours the day of the procedure , require regional anesthetic technique without contraindications to the procedure and can be performed with the patient in the lateral decubitus , have not known history of allergy , and have n't as an exclusion criteria malformations of the spine level that would prevent a spinal block without difficulty . Procedure : assigned randomly selected for each patient using a scheme sedation , 75 numbers were randomly through a generator of random number tables , with a minimum value of 1 and a maximum value of 3 , and as they selected a patient was applied corresponding scheme in sequential order . On admission to the operating room the patient was channeled to a peripheral vein 18 -20Gauge , were monitored with electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , non -invasive blood pressure ( NIBP ) and oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry ( O2Sat ) by a vital signs monitor ; hemodynamic variables were recorded income . Was applied intravenously one of the pre-established schemes sedation according to patient weight and oxygen was administered by nasal cannula 1Litre/minutes , hemodynamic changes were recorded at 2.5 and 5 minutes from the scheme were implemented and evaluated the Ramsay scale at the time . The patient is positioned for carrying the anesthetic technique , and with a Quincke needle 26 Gauge , spinal anesthesia by a team of experienced anesthesiology was placed , corresponding to the authors of this study , the number of attempts and difficulty to blockade were noted , at the end of the surgical procedure a satisfaction survey was performed to the patient about their experience with spinal block . The data collection was performed using a format that included sociodemographic characteristics , variables of interest and two measuring scales were used : The first was the RANSAY SCALE , which is a scale used to assess the depth of sedation , is validated over 30 years ago , is easy to use and has been the gold standard in many studies that evaluated sedation ; as you increase the level on the scale , increasing the degree of sedation . Being awake patient can be found in a level 1 , referring to an anxious and / or agitated patients in level 2 , when partner is quiet and focused and have spontaneous eye opening , or a level 3 when has closed eyelids , but quickly responds to verbal stimuli . When the patient was found asleep , level 4 will be called if you are still with closed eyes and responds quickly to tactile and verbal stimuli strong , level 5 when it has a slower response and only responds to important and / or painful stimuli and level 6 when does not respond to any stimulus . In addition , a SATISFACTION SCALE TYPE LIKERT was used to subjectively evaluate how satisfied was the patient with spinal anesthesia under sedation , the scale is not validated , giving a score of 1 to refer to be very satisfied , 2 if only felt satisfied , a score of 3 to be dissatisfied , 4 if it meant feeling unsatisfied and finally a rating of 5 if it meant being very dissatisfied . Data analysis : the counting of categorical variables are reported as absolute numbers and percentages . Differences in baseline characteristics and post-intervention were estimated through hypothesis testing . For qualitative variables the Chi square test and Fisher 's exact test was used , as appropriate . In quantitative variables of normal verified through Shapiro-Wilk test and comparison groups by ANOVA , this analysis was supported with Epi Info v7 and Stata software . Ethical issues : the declaration of Helsinki and the regulations in force in Colombia ( 1993 Resolution No.008430 MOH 2378 and resolution 2008 on good clinical practice ) was adjusted .

Wenzhou Medical University,NCT02139982,The Study of Regional Hemodynamic Changes After Specific Brachial Plexus Block by Ultrasound Guidance,Wenzhou Medical University,1,1,Upper Limb Nerve Block,Procedure,specific nerve block,Basic Science,Double,"Phase 1 Sympathetic block leads to vasodilatation and increases in blood flow . However , regional hemodynamic changes of radial and ulnar artery after specific nerve block of brachial plexus remains unclear . The aim of the study is to assess the effect of specific nerve block of brachial plexus on hemodynamics of upper extremity , and provides evidence for further research in patient undergoing microvascular surgery . Phase 2 There is no literature about dose-finding studies of sympathetic block after brachial plexus block . Little is known regarding the relationship between concentration of local anaesthetic and vasodilation of upper extremity . The aim of this randomized , double-blind , prospective dose-response study is to determine the ED50 and ED95 of ropivacaine in sympathetic block of upper extremity after supraclavicular block","Phase 1 Brachial plexus block ( BPB ) is a widely used regional anesthetic technique for upper limb surgery . The effect of sympathetic block of BPB can leads to vasodilatation and increase blood flow and skin temperature in the ipsilateral upper limb . At the level of the axillary region , the sympathetic nerves innervating the radial and ulnar artery travel with the brachial plexus , but it is unclear which specific nerve : musculocutaneous , radial , ulnar , and median innervates radial or ulnar artery . Radial and ulnar artery and their branches are common donor or recipient vessels in the vascular reconstruction surgery and their hemodynamic changes may affect the blood flow of vascular anastomoses in vascular reconstruction . Sometimes , brachial plexus could be partially blocked intentionally or unintentionally , with the resultant regional hemodynamic changes unclear . As the use of ultrasound guided peripheral nerve block getting increasingly popular , peripheral nerve can be blocked visually , with good accuracy and ease . It has made specific nerve block in the axillary region possible . Can specific nerve block increase the blood flow of target artery ( radial or ulnar artery ) and benefit microvascular surgery , or will it decrease the blood flow in other arteries and have a negative impact on microvascular surgery ? In this study , the investigators will measure the hemodynamic changes of radial and ulnar artery after performing specific nerve blocks of the musculocutaneous , radial , ulnar , or median nerves respectively in patients without vascular disease . The aim is to assess the effect of specific nerve block on hemodynamics of upper extremity , and provided evidence for further research in patients undergoing microvascular surgery . The subjects of study are patients undergoing upper extremity operation . All patients will be randomized into 4 groups according to the specific nerve block ( SNB ) of brachial plexus : group MC ( musculocutaneous ) , group UL ( ulnar ) , group RA ( radial ) and group ME ( median ) . Patients are randomised to the four groups by random number ( generated by computer ) in sealed envelopes . Sample randomization will be done in four groups by random-number using sealed envelopes . Each patient will receive allocated SNB of brachial plexus ( musculocutaneous , radial , ulnar , or median ) followed by Axillary brachial plexus block successively using ultrasound guidance combined neurostimulation . All nerve blocks will be performed by a single dedicated anesthetist . A second investigator , who is blinded to the protocol and patient allocation , will perform the measurements . Sensory blockade will be assessed by pinprick sensation ( 22 G needle ) and compare with the opposite forearm/hand for normal , hypoesthesia or no sensation . Success of SNB is defined as only loss of sensation in the cutaneous distribution of the specific nerve ( musculocutaneous , ulnar , radial , or median nerves ) at 30min after SNB . If hypoesthesia or no sensation is detected in the innervation areas of any other nerve , the patient will be excluded . Success of BPB is defined as the absence of sensation to in all innervation areas of above four nerves 30min after the BPB . Measurement of hemodynamic parameters The ulnar artery and radial artery is located at 1 cm proximal to the ulnar or radial styloid process . Specific points will be located with skin marker to provide consistency with all measurements taken . Hemodynamic parameters will is measured by Pulsed-wave Doppler ( PWD ) ultrasound . The probe will be placed on the ventral wrist parallel to the long axis of the forearm without undue pressure on the artery during the PWD measurements . The volume gate will be positioned in the center of the arterial lumen , and the size of the gate will be 1/3 lumen of the artery . The angle of insonation is adjusted and maintained at 50-60 degrees . Once a desired PWD spectral waveform is achieved , the arterial hemodynamic parameters will be recorded . Phase 2 The subjects of study are patients undergoing upper extremity operation under supraclavicular brachial plexus block . All patients will be randomly assigned to receive 30ml ropivacaine in concentrations of 0.125 % , 0.2 % , 0.25 % , 0.375 % , 0.5 % , or 0.75 % . Patients are randomised to the four groups by random number ( generated by computer ) in sealed envelopes . All nerve blocks were performed by a single dedicated anaesthetist who remains blinded to the concentration of ropivacaine . A second investigator , who is blinded to the protocol and patient allocation , will perform the measurements . Another investigator , who is not present during the conduct of the BPB and blinded to the concentration of ropivacaine used will assess each blockade . Patient are also blinded . The brachial plexus will be visualized using a high-frequency linear ultrasound transducer in the supraclavicular fossa . After skin disinfection and infiltrating with 1 % lidocaine , nerve stimulation needle will be inserted using in-line technique , and advanced among the divisions of brachial plexus with electric impulses ( 2 Hz , 0.3mA , 0.1 ms ) of nerve stimulator . If visible contraction of the innervated muscle is elicited , the needle will be withdrawn slowly until the corresponding muscle contraction disappears to avoid intrafascicular puncture . The local anesthetic will be injected at three locations : adjacent to the superficial divisions of the plexus , adjacent to the middle divisions and inferior divisions . The proportion of the volume injected in each area is at the discretion of the expert operator according to the spread of local anesthetic . The efficacy of the block will be assessed by pinprick sensation ( 22 G needle ) and compared with the opposite arm/hand for normal , hypoesthesia or no sensation . For patients with an ineffective block , supplementary local anesthesia will be administered according to the distribution of the block and site of surgery after measurement . If the patient experienced any pain during surgery , supplementary analgesia , sedation , or general anesthesia will be administered as required . Patient 's arm is in supination . The brachial artery will be located in 2 cm proximal to the antecubital fossa . Hemodynamic Parameters will be measured by Pulsed-wave Doppler ( PWD ) ultrasound . The probe will be parallel the long axis of the arm without undue pressure on the artery during the PWD measurements . The volume gate will be positioned in the center of the arterial lumen , and the size of the gate will be 1/3 lumen of the artery . The angle of insonation will be adjusted and maintained at 50-60 degrees . Once a desired PWD spectral waveform is achieved , the arterial hemodynamic parameters will be recorded . The cross-sectional area ( CSA ) of the artery will be assessed with B-mode imaging . Probe should be as perpendicular as possible to the long axis of the artery to obtain as round an arterial section as possible .

One of the complications the pain particularly in the extremities resulting from a process known as diabetic foot ulcer . The diabetic patients are subjected to many complications because of foot ulcers , many of them like as chronic wound disease or pressure ulcers ( bed sore ) . Routinely used medical measures for diabetic foot ulcers are depended to nursing care and take too long until pain relief . Among many tested materials and works for wound healing such as debridement , tissue oxygenation , and skin transplantation , platelet-derived compounds are allocated the pivotal position between investigators to tissue regeneration and shortening the wound healing process . Many of platelet components are procured from platelet rich plasma ( PRP ) from whole blood donation . Furthermore , it requires to an additional purification step to diminish the volume and facilitate handling in some studies . It means that platelet concentrates ( PCs ) may be obtained leading to more concentrated platelets in lower volume . Two types of granules in platelet is responsible for storage of many useful and different growth factors : dense or delta and alpha granules . Platelet-derived growth factors have the ability to growth and differentiation of numerous cells . Also , the antibacterial effect of these growth factors has been reported .

Oxidative stress is also known to adversely impact corneal endothelial cells , and may be a factor resulting in the acute decrease in corneal endothelial cell density following ocular surgery . While corticosteroids provide potent anti-inflammatory efficacy in a wide range of acute and chronic inflammatory ocular diseases , their use is limited by their side effect profile , which includes the potential to elevate IOP and induce cataract formation .

Men with a genetic variation in the gene coding for Choline Dehydrogenase ( CHDH ) have decreased energy production by sperm , and their sperm do not swim normally . The metabolic product of this gene is a nutrient called betaine ( found normally in the diet as a part of many foods such as spinach , beets and grain products ) . This study tests whether treatment with betaine is safe and whether it can normalize energy production in sperm of these men and restore normal swimming ability .","Unidentified genetic aberrations such as single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) may be the underlying cause of many cases of idiopathic infertility in men . Choline dehydrogenase ( encoded by CHDH ) converts choline to betaine in the mitochondria . 5-9 % of men have 2 alleles for a functional SNP in CHDH ( rs12676 ) , and they have low sperm adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) concentrations with impaired sperm motility ( asthenospermia ) that should decrease fertility . Male mice in which CHDH is deleted also have very low sperm ATP , asthenospermia and are infertile . Supplementation of these mice with dietary betaine increases sperm motility and ATP concentrations . This purpose of this study is to conduct a phase I study of betaine treatment in men with 2 minor alleles for CHDH rs12676 to determine whether betaine supplementation is safe and to obtain preliminary data on the effects of betaine on sperm mitochondrial ATP concentrations and sperm motility in these men .",2014-04-17,"September 7, 2016","Inclusion Criteria : 18 - 60 year old men of multiple races and ethnicities Estimated dietary intake of betaine of < 150 mg/day Carrying two alleles of the rs 12676 single nucleotide polymorphism Exclusion Criteria : Cystathionine-beta-synthase ( CBS ) deficiency Currently taking betaine supplements Currently receiving chemotherapy , radiation or any gonadotoxic drug Female gender",6,1,18 Years,60 Years

Rivaroxaban: A New Antithrombotic Treatment for Patients With Mechanical Prosthetic Aortic Heart Valve.,"Insel Gruppe AG, University Hospital Bern",2,0,Aortic Valve Disease,Drug,Rivaroxaban,Treatment,,"Objectives Primary objective : To determine if rivaroxaban ( Xarelto ) is feasible and safe for prevention of major complications in patients undergoing a mechanical aortic heart valve replace-ment . Secondary objectives : To identify the value of molecular markers suitable for monitoring of anticoagulation effectiveness of rivaroxaban and its correlation with transcranial Doppler emboli count in patients undergoing a mechanical aortic heart valve replacement . Design This is a prospective , open-label phase 2 pilot study with independent evaluation of all outcomes and a historical control group . Number of patients 30 in experimental group ( patients in the center 's registry database serve as control group ) . Main eligibility criteria All patients between 18 and 70 years old receiving a mechanical aortic valve replacement with a pre-operative left ventricular ejection fraction > /=35 % . Interventions Experimental : Rivaroxaban 20mg p.o. , once daily , for six months Historical control : Phenprocoumon ( Marcoumar ) p.o. , once daily Outcomes Primary outcome : Composite outcome of prosthetic thrombus requiring reoperation/intervention , major bleeding , visceral ischemia , stroke , pulmonary embolism , myocardial infarction or death from any cause 180 days after intervention . Secondary outcomes : Each component of the composite outcome plus serious adverse events . Prosthetic thrombus requiring reoperation/intervention plus non-clinically relevant thrombi will be used as an additional safety outcome . Molecular markers suitable for monitoring the effectiveness of rivaroxaban .","Background Although the overall incidence of complications associated with prosthetic cardiac valve implantation has decreased considerably since its introduction more than 3 decades ago , valvular thrombosis and systemic thromboembolism remain a major concern for cardiothoracic surgeons , cardiologists , and other practicing clinicians because of the well-known potential to cause devastating events including ischemic stroke and death . Factors that contribute to the thrombogenicity of prosthetic heart valves include : altered blood flow and haemostatic activation caused by vessel-wall disruption during surgery or exposure of artificial surfaces to the circulating blood . Short-term parenteral anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin is often used until therapeutic concentrations of an oral vitamin K antagonist are reached . Vitamin K antagonists , alone or in combination with aspirin , are used for long-term management of these patients . However , Vitamin K antagonists are cumbersome to use , because of their multiple interactions with food and drugs , and they require frequent laboratory monitoring . Therefore , they are often not used , and when they are , rates of discontinuation are high . Many patients receiving Phenprocoumon still have inadequate anticoagulation . Thus , there is a need for new anticoagulant agents . Patients who self-monitor therapy with vitamin K antagonists at home rather than in a laboratory are more often in the therapeutic range and have a lower incidence of complications and hospital admissions than those who do not . Meta-analyses of randomized trials have recently found that patient self-monitoring was associated with a 33 % reduction of risk of death , a 55 % reduction of risk of thromboembolism , and a slight decrease in major haemorrhage . Self-monitoring was also associated with improved quality of life and satisfaction . However , the number of INR values within the target range in self-monitored patients is still very poor , which is no more than 70 % ! , even taking in account a wide range of INR 2.5-4.5 . Another main obstacle to widespread use of patient self-monitoring is cost . In the UK National Health Service , the estimated cost of patient self-monitoring is £122 000 per quality-adjusted life year ( QALY ) over 5 years and £63 000 over 10 years . This is not cost-effective considering the commonly accepted threshold of £30 000 per QALY . Costs are related to the portable INR-monitoring device , test strips , and patient education programs . The oral direct thrombin inhibitor - dabigatran etexilate - and two oral direct factor Xa inhibitors - rivaroxaban and apixaban - are in advanced stages of clinical development and are expected to replace oral vitamin K antagonists for many indications . There is a published phase 2 , dose-validation study investigating the use of dabigatran in patients with mechanical heart valves ( the RE-ALIGN trial ) . This trial was terminated prematurely because of an excess of thromboembolic and bleeding events among dabigatran-treated patients . Does the RE-ALIGN trial preclude the investigation of rivaroxaban and other direct oral factor Xa inhibitors in patients with mechanical heart valves ? Not necessarily ! Coagulation develops in at least two subsequent waves of thrombin generation and fibrin deposition , with factor Xa playing a pivotal role for its amplification . In fact , since activation of 1 molecule of factor X results in the generation of 1000 molecules of thrombin , on a molar basis factor Xa is more thrombogenic than thrombin and several lines of research show that it requires less heparin to inhibit thrombosis prior thrombin formation than afterwards . Therefore , there is a sound rationale for hypothesizing that direct factor Xa inhibitors may be more efficient than dabigatran in preventing thromboembolic events among patients with mechanical heart valves . Objective Primary Objective : CATHAR is a pilot study to determine if rivaroxaban is feasible and safe for prevention of major complications in patients undergoing a mechanical aortic heart valve replacement . Secondary objectives will be to identify the value of molecular markers suitable for monitoring of anticoagulation effectiveness of rivaroxaban and its correlation with transcranial Doppler emboli count in patients undergoing a mechanical aortic heart valve replacement . Methods CATHAR is a prospective , open-label , pilot , phase 2 study with independent evaluation of all outcomes .

Individuals with metabolic syndrome often have impaired glucose tolerance , which is a condition where blood sugar is normal when fasting ( before eating ) , but is too high after drinking a sugary drink . This is due to an abnormality in the body 's sensitivity to insulin ( insulin resistance ) , which is due in part to an inability of the muscle to take up glucose . People with metabolic syndrome have inflammation in their fat tissue and in their blood stream , and the changes in the level of inflammatory chemicals produced by cells in your fat tissues will be studied . One possible source of the inflammation may be the bacteria in the intestine . When individuals eat fatty foods , some of the bacterial products become attached to the fat in their blood and then get directed to fat tissue . The investigators wish to determine whether individuals have an excessive amount of inflammation in their fat tissues , and whether this inflammation comes from the bacteria in their intestines . To determine this , the investigators wish to treat individuals with an antibiotic that reduces the bacteria in their intestines and in their blood , and determine whether this reduces their overall level of inflammation .","This is a randomized , placebo-controlled proof of concept study that will examine the investigational drug Rifaximin Soluble Solid Dispersion ( SSD ) ability to reduce gut microbiota and thereby reduce adipose inflammation and improve insulin resistance . Each subject enrolled will undergo a fat tolerance test with a high-fat meal , an oral glucose tolerance test , a fat biopsy , and a euglycemic clamp . Following their successful completion of those procedures subjects will be randomized to study treatment . That treatment will involve receiving the investigational drug,80 mg per day of rifaximin-soluble solid dispersion ( SDD ) , or placebo for 12 weeks . All procedures will be performed on the Clinical Services Core of the CCTS . The initial visit will involve informed consent , and routine labs ( comprehensive metabolic panel , lipid panel , TSH , CBC with platelets ) . These routine labs are for safety purposes and to rule out exclusionary disorders . A stool sample will also be collected and frozen for possible future analysis of bacterial microflora .

The long term objectives are to gain a better understanding of caffeine and its affects following exercise-induced muscle damage allowing us to understand how caffeine is mechanistically interacting with functions of the body .","A within participant , repeated measures experimental design will be used such that each participant will serve as his/her own control . Caffeine and placebo will be administered in a double-blind , counterbalanced manner . Caffeine and placebo ( white flour ) pills will be prepared by Kerri Tiedman or Jackie Straughn at the Doctors Park Pharmacy using an analytical balance . Anhydrous caffeine or white flour will be placed into opaque capsules . The pills will be placed into envelopes by Chris Black . He will then use a computer generated random number table to assign caffeine or placebo pills for each testing session in a counter-balanced fashion . The participant 's identification number , as well as session number will be placed on the envelope . A spreadsheet containing only the participants ' numbers and the testing condition will be kept by Chris Black until the study is complete . Jessica , Robby , Alex , Josh , and Jamie the research assistants , who will be blinded to the contents of the envelopes , will administer the pills to the participants and collect data from the participants . This will ensure the blinding of the researchers to the condition during data collection . Following the completion of data collection the spreadsheet will be given to all the above stated research assistants and the blinding will be broken for data analysis . Total time commitment for the study will be approximately 10 hours over the course of 14 days . Three familiarization session and 5 testing sessions will be completed . Test Day 1 : - Potential participants will report to the sensory and muscle function lab for a 30 minute session involving the following : D1.1 Written and verbal description of the experiment and all procedures will be given , and any questions will be answered . Informed consent will be completed . D1.2 A physical activity readiness questionnaire ( PAR-Q ) will be completed ( identifies contraindications to exercise.D1.3 A questionnaire screening for the potential adverse reactions to caffeine , current medication and supplements as well as an increased risk of rhabdomyolysis use will be competed . D1.4 Seated , resting blood pressure will be assessed in the right brachial artery . D1.5 Potential participants deemed eligible for the study will be asked to orally state to the researchers what they will be expected to do in the study and explain the risks and benefits of the study to confirm they understand the procedures , time commitment , freedom to withdraw , and risk and benefits of study participation . D1.6 Next , participants will practice the procedure for determining maximal voluntary isometric strength ( MVC ) of the plantar flexor muscle group . Participants will be seated in a specially designed chair with their hip at an angle of 90 degrees . A series of 3 maximal , all-out isometric contractions ( contractions against a stationary object where the muscle does not shorten or lengthen ) will be performed . Each contraction will last approximately 3 seconds . Participants will be given verbal encouragement throughout the contraction . Muscle activation ( the amount or percentage of total muscle mass of the plantar flexors the person is able to use during a contraction ) during the isometric contractions will be assessed using the interpolated-twitch technique ( ITT ) . This technique involves applying an electrical current to the muscle via stimulation of the tibial motor axon ( nerve ) while it is contracting to determine if the muscle is able to generate any additional force , above and beyond what the participant can generate on their own . The force from this stimulation is compared to the force generated in a relaxed , non-contracting muscle to determine the percentage of the muscle the participant can active during a contraction . To perform the ITT stimulating electrodes are placed proximal to the patella and behind the knee over the tibial nerve . Participants will receive a brief ( 10 milliseconds ) high intensity stimulation of the muscle during each contraction , and at 4 and 6 seconds following each contraction ( while the muscle is relaxed ) . The MVC as well as the ITT will be determined in both the right and left calf .

D3.1 MVC and muscle activation of the plantar flexors will be practiced once again as described previously Testing Day 4 : Participants will report to the sensory and muscle function lab for a 2 hour testing session . D4.1 The pressure pain threshold ( PPT ) of both the right and left calf muscles will be assessed . A mark will be placed over the belly of the plantar flexor muscle group on each leg . Researchers will place a pressure algometer over the test site and will gradually apply pressure at a rate of 0.50 kg/sec until the participant indicates the pressure has moved from being `` uncomfortable '' to `` faintly painful . '' The participant will indicate this by depressing a button connected to the algometer . As soon as the participant indicates pain , the pressure stimulus will be removed by the researcher . D4.2 Muscle soreness in the plantar flexors muscle group will be assessed . This will be done by having participants perform 3 separate eccentric contractions of the plantar flexors using their body weight . Participants will be instructed to perform each eccentric contraction in a slow and controlled manner . After each action the participant will be asked to rate the intensity of the pain/hurt/soreness in their plantar flexors during the lift . A 10 cm visual analog scale ( VAS ) will be used to assess soreness . Participants will be instructed to place a mark along the 10 cm line that corresponds to the intensity of pain experienced during the lift . Anchors of `` no pain '' and `` worst pain imaginable '' will be placed on the left and right end of the 10 cm line , respectively . D4.3 Spinal excitability will be assessed by determining the H-reflex in the tibial nerve . Participants will be seated ( as described previously ) in the specially designed chair with their foot secured to a pedal . Two recording electrodes will be placed on the skin over the belly of the soleus muscle in order to record the electrical activity ( EMG ) for the soleus . A ground electrode will be placed over the lateral malleolus . Stimulating electrodes will be placed over the tibial nerve in the popliteal fossa and proximal to the patella . A series of 25-30 stimulation pulses will be delivered ( each lasting 1 millisecond ) in order to visualize the H and M wave recruitment curve . D4.4 Contractile characteristics of the plantar flexors will be assessed by performing a series of stimulated contractions ( via stimulation of the tibial nerve as described above ) . Six stimulated contractions , each lasting 1 second will be performed . Three each at a stimulation frequency of 20 hertz and 3 at a stimulation frequency of 100 hertz and each stimulation will be separated by 30 seconds . D4.5 MVC and muscle activation of the plantar flexors will be assessed as described previously . D4.6 Participants will consume gelatin capsules containing either a 5mg/kg body weight dose of anhydrous caffeine or a placebo ( white flour ) . D.4.7 Participants will rest quietly for 60 minutes . D4.8 PPT of the plantar flexors will be assessed as described previously . D4.9 Muscle soreness will be assessed as described previously . D4.10 H-reflex will be assessed as described previously D4.11 20 hertz and 100 hertz contractile characteristics will be assessed as described previously . D4.12 MVC and muscle activation will be assessed as described previously . Test Day 5 : Participants will report to the sensory and muscle function lab approximately 24 hours following testing day 4 for a 2 hour testing session . All procedures from test day 4 will be repeated on testing day 5 . If participants were randomly assigned to receive caffeine on testing day 4 , they will receive the placebo on day 5 , and vice versa . Test Day 6 : Participants will report to the sensory and muscle function lab approximately 24 hours following testing day 5 for a 30 minute session . Participants will complete 60 eccentric muscle actions ( 6 sets of 10 repetitions ) of the plantar flexors with their dominant leg using a weight approximating 120 % of their maximal strength . Participants will be instructed to perform each eccentric muscle action in a slow ( ~ 3 sec ) and controlled fashion . Researchers will verbally count during each action to assist in controlling the speed of the movement . The researchers will raise the weight prior to the start of each lift . This is so that the participant performs eccentric muscle actions only . Upon completion of the eccentric exercise , participants will be asked to refrain from the use of pain relieving medications , including alcohol , until the experiment has been completed . Participants will also be reminded of the instructions for monitoring symptoms related to rhabdomyolysis and of the instructions for proper hydration for the duration of the study . Test Day 7-8 : Participants will report to the applied physiology lab approximately 24 hours following testing day 6 and 7 for a 2 hour testing session . All procedures from test day 4 will be repeated during testing day 7 and 8 . Caffeine and placebo capsules will be administered in a counter-balanced fashion such that each participant will receive caffeine on 1 test day and placebo on the other . A completely within participants repeated measures ANOVA will be used to test for differences between each outcome measure between conditions and over time . Assuming a power of 0.80 , a sample size of 20 participants will allow for detection of a difference between conditions of approximately 0.50 standard deviation ( a moderate effect ) for the interaction . Previous studies have demonstrated caffeine enhances strength and the h-reflex by approximately 0.40-0.90 standard deviation . As such the proposed sample size should be large enough to detect any meaningful difference between the caffeine and placebo conditions . The printed hard copies of subject information and data will be kept in a locked file cabinet in the principle investigator 's office which will be locked if he is not there . The principle investigator will be the only individual with keys to both . All electronic files for the project will be kept password protected . Only the principle investigator as well as the respective graduate students will know the password . In the event of an adverse event the principle investigator . will contact the institutional review board within 2 business days with the appropriate documentation . Data and Safety Monitoring Board will be comprised of two members the principle investigator ( Chris Black ) and the Co-Investigator ( Jessica Renfroe ) .

Hypothesis : Xenon-inhalation enhances erythropoetin-levels in blood,"Xenon-gas is an approved anesthetic by the EMEA and is used for a balanced anesthesia in combination with opioids for adults with a american society of anesthesiology classification ASA ≤ III . Several clinical and pre-clinical studies have shown a positive effect of xenon on several organ functions such as in brain , kidneys and heart . In two studies , an enhanced expression of hypoxia inducible factor-1α ( HIF-1α ) could be shown in animal kidneys and kidney cells . Interestingly , HIF-1α leads to an enhanced formation of erythropoetin ( EPO ) . This might result in an enhanced oxygen transport capacity and an enhanced oxygen-level after xenon-treatment .

Ramathibodi Hospital,NCT02065947,Three-level Injection Paravertebral Block vs General Anesthesia in Mastectomy,Ramathibodi Hospital,1,1,Radical Mastectomy,Procedure,paravertebral block,Treatment,Single,"The purpose of the study is to investigate if paravertebral block for breast surgery may improve postoperative analgesia and shorten length of hospital stay . Within a prospective clinical trial sixty women ( ASA I - III ) undergoing unilateral mastectomy surgery with axillary dissection are enrolled . Exclusion criteria are general infection and local infection at the site of planned puncture , anatomic deformities of the thoracic spine , coagulation disorders , allergy against local anesthetics or contrast agents , pregnancy or breast-feeding and BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 . Patients are randomly assigned to two groups , 30 patients each , by using block of four method . Group I patients receive paravertebral block at spine level Th 4 via catheter ; Group II patients will have general anesthesia without nitrous oxide . Paravertebral block ( PVB ) will be entirely performed by one person ( 1st author ) with the patient in prone position . In randomly selected patients the catheter localization will be detected by fluoroscopy after injection of 0.5 ml contrast agent . The catheter positioned at about 8 cm from skin level , a mixture of 10 ml bupivacaine 0.5 % plus 20 ml lidocaine 2 % with adrenaline 1:200,000 will be injected sequentially 10 ml each while withdrawing the catheter 2 cm after the first and again 2 cm after the second injection . Then the catheter will be removed . Low dose intraoperative sedation is provided with IV midazolam 2-3 mg , ketamine 0.5 mg/kg bolus and continuous propofol using target-controlled infusion ( TCI ) system aiming at effect site concentration ( Ce ) of 1 - 1.5 mcg/mL to allow spontaneous breathing . In case surgical approach is not tolerated , the regional block is graded insufficient , and it is switched to general anesthesia . At postoperative care unit ( PACU ) the pain score using visual rating scale ( VRS ) from 0 to 10 ( worst imaginable pain ) is assessed at rest and on movement of the shoulder every 15 minutes until 60 minutes . Analgesia is provided by IV morphine 0.04 mg/kg boluses with a 15-min dosing interval to maintain VRS - score < 3 . Time to first analgesic demand and 24-hr analgesics consumption is recorded as well as postoperative nausea and vomiting ( PONV ) . Complications are recorded including those related to the paravertebral block , such as Horner 's syndrome , epidural spreading , hypotension that is not related to another . Patients will be checked 6 , 12 , and 24hr postoperatively for adverse effects , pain scores , and satisfaction scores .","Multiple studies have shown that breast surgery is associated with significant postoperative pain , nausea , vomiting , and development of chronic pain . General anaesthesia is associated with a 50 % incidence of nausea and vomiting among breast cancer surgery patients . The proposed benefits of regional anesthesia including paravertebral block compared to general anaesthesia are decreasing stress response , improving postoperative pain control and postoperative pulmonary function , decreasing cancer recurrence , and reducing thromboembolic events . However , the debate about these benefits is still controversial . Paravertebral block for breast surgery , either alone or additional to general anaesthesia is favored by many investigators , due to better postoperative analgesia and shorter hospital stay . In an elder investigation thermographic imaging was used to apply paravertebral block . After a single injection of 15 ml 0.5 % bupivacaine at spine level Th9-Th10 there was a mean distribution of somatic block of five and of sympathetic block of eight dermatomes without any hemodynamic side effects . No bilateral spread was found . The authors contradicted the suggestions paravertebral block being ineffective and sometimes hazardous . However , their patients were chronic pain patients with a number of six only . Single-injection paravertebral block may not be sufficient to cover the relevant dermatomes C6 - Th6 for radical mastectomy with axillary dissection , when applied as the sole anesthetic technique . Some study groups performed paravertebral block with several injections . Four injections resulted in sufficient anaesthesia in 97 % of these patients , whereas one injection was effective in only 11 % . Though there is limited published evidence yet , a single injection for paravertebral block may be insufficient for extensive breast surgery , such as mastectomy including axillary evisceration . However , considering the potential risks of deep paravertebral puncture a limitation of punctures would be preferable . Inserting a paravertebral catheter far enough and in proper position offers the opportunity to apply the anesthetic agent at different sites , by moving the catheter backwards after each injection . The purpose of our study is to find out if injections via paravertebral catheter at three different levels are advantageous and efficient compared to general anesthesia in patients having mastectomy with axillary dissection . In addition , instead of 4 cm catheter insertion inside the paravertebral space ( PVS ) as the recommended , we used ultrasound-guided PVB ( transverse view , out of plane technique ) , to facilitate further insertion of the catheter ( 8 cm ) in the PVS . A contrast agent will be used in randomly selected patients to prove the exact site of the inserted catheter and to exclude/detect obstructions such as kinking . Methods : This is a prospective clinical trial . Patients have to agree documented by written informed consent . Sixty women , ASA I - III undergoing unilateral mastectomy surgery with axillary dissection , including radical lymph node removal or sentinel node biopsy are enrolled . Patients are randomly assigned to two groups , 30 patients each , by using block of four method . Group I patients receive paravertebral block at spine level Th 4 via catheter with injections at three different levels ; Group II patients will have general anesthesia . Anesthetic preparation : After arrival at the OR standard monitoring is applied including ECG , noninvasive blood pressure and pulse oxymetry . Midazolam 0.05 mg per kilogram bodyweight is given intravenously to all patients to achieve mild sedation . Paravertebral block ( Group I ) . Paravertebral block will be entirely performed by one person ( first author ) with the patient in prone position . The superior aspect of the Th4 spinous process is marked . After skin disinfection an 18-gauge Tuohy needle including attached saline filled syringe is inserted perpendicular to the skin at the Th3-Th4 interspace , using the area 2.5 cm lateral to T4 spinous process as Landmark . Under ultrasound guidance , the needle is advanced by out of plane technique , angled anteriorly until contact with the transverse process , and then redirected either caudal or cephalad and parallel to the spine advanced further until loss of resistance . After placement of the needle an end-hole 20 gauge catheter is inserted and advanced 8 cm beyond needlepoint into the paravertebral space . The catheter insertion is scored as 'easy ' , 'difficult ' or 'impossible ' . In randomly selected patients the catheter localization will be detected by fluoroscopy after injection of 0.5 ml contrast agent . The catheter positioned , a mixture of 10 ml bupivacaine 0.5 % plus 20 ml lidocaine 2 % with adrenaline 1:200,000 will be slowly injected sequentially 10 ml each while withdrawing the catheter 2 cm after the first and again 2 cm after the second injection . Then the catheter will be removed . Patients are returned to the supine position and remain for at least 30 minutes in the preoperative area . Sensory blockade is assessed by using pin-prick method . When analgesia is adequate patients are moved into the operating room . Intraoperative sedation is provided with low dose IV midazolam , ketamine bolus and continuous propofol using target-controlled infusion system to allow spontaneous breathing . In case skin incision or further surgical approach is not tolerated , the regional block is graded insufficient , and it is switched to general anesthesia . General Anaesthesia ( Group II ) : Anesthesia is induced intravenously with propofol and fentanyl . Atracurium is used to facilitate tracheal intubation . Anesthesia is maintained with sevoflurane and 50 % oxygen in air . Additional Fentanyl will be administered on discretion of the anesthesiologist . Data collection : Patients ' biometric data , details of the clinical course , such as amount of anesthetics used , operation time , surgical difficulties , hemodynamic instability ( if any ) and similar are recorded . At postoperative care unit ( PACU ) the pain score using visual rating scale from 0 ( no pain ) to 10 ( worst imaginable pain ) is assessed at rest and on movement of the shoulder every 15 minutes until 60 minutes . Analgesia is provided by IV morphine boluses with a 15-min dosing interval to maintain VRS - score < 3 . Time to first analgesic demand and 24-hr analgesics consumption is recorded . Postoperative nausea and vomiting is assessed using a 3-point scale ; Ondansetron is administered to treat it . Any complications are recorded including those related to paravertebral block , such as Horner 's syndrome , epidural spreading , hypotension that is not related to another reason , pneumothorax and adverse effect of local anesthetics . Patients will be checked 6 , 12 , and 24hr postoperatively for adverse effects , pain scores , and satisfaction scores . During hospital stay , the patients receive one tablet of Ultracet ( tramadol plus acetaminophen ) and Celebrex 200 mg two times a day for pain relief and oral lorazepam before bedtime . Residents or nurses on postoperative care station and surgical ward both are blinded to the treatment groups . Sample size estimation : According to the data from a previous study paravertebral block compared to general anesthesia can reduce postoperative analgesia requirement ( opioids + non-steroidal analgesics ) up to 80 % . Taking a 5 % significance level as basis 30 patients per group is adequate . Statistical analyses : Parametric data are expressed as mean and analyzed using Student 's T test . The non-parametric data are expressed as median ( range ) and analyzed using Mann-Whitney U Test . Repeated analysis of variance is used to compare VAS between groups . The association between the techniques and incidence of complications are evaluated by chi-square or Fisher 's exact test as appropriate . Statistical analyses will be performed using SPSS v20.0 for Windows ( SPSS Inc. , Chicago , USA ) . All tests are two-sided and a p-value of < 0.05 is accepted as statistically significant .",2014-01-28,"March 6, 2014","Inclusion Criteria : Samples are collected after patients ' written informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and institutional research board approval .

The basics of the disorder : inattentive and hyperactive/impulsive behaviors that manifest in a variety of settings causing a dysfunction in everyday life . ADHD can be subdivided into three sub-types : predominantly inattentive , predominantly hyperactive/impulsive or combined type . Common co-morbidities of ADHD are disruptive disorders ; Oppositional defiant disorder ( ODD ) being the major one with about half of children with the combined sub-type ADHD and about a quarter of children with the predominantly inattentive also suffering from ODD . Conduct disorder is a co-morbidity for about a quarter of children with the combined sub-type ADHD . The co-occurrence of these disorders is thought to have a negative effect on the outcome of both of them . Methylphenidate ( MPH ) , short or long acting , is the mainstay of medical treatment for ADHD patients , it 's efficacy proven in a variety of studies . It should be noted that MPH has also been proven to have a beneficial effect on children with disruptive behaviors . For children with disruptive disorders Risperidone is the mainstay of medical treatment , and has been proven in clinical trials . To the best of their knowledge , a `` head to head '' study comparing these two drugs for the treatment of pediatric patients with ADHD and co-morbidity of disruptive disorders was never done before . The investigators aim is to examine the efficacy and tolerability of MPH vs. Risperidone in this population . In addition , the investigators will apply DSM5 's cross cutting symptom measures scales is order to further define this unique subset of patients . Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder ( DMDD ) is a new diagnosis in the latest version of the diagnostic and statistical manual ( DSM5 ) . It 's main features : sever recurrent temper outbursts that are inconsistent with developmental level and occur on average three times a week , the outbursts occur in at least two settings and the mood between outbursts is irritable or angry .

University of Siena,NCT02068807,Evaluation of Antioxidant Activity of Oral Lutein in Preterm and Term Newborn,University of Siena,1,1,"Infant, Newborn, Diseases",Dietary Supplement,Lutein drops,Prevention,Double,"The balance of the redox state is important for normal embryonic and fetal development . During the perinatal period , a variety of conditions are responsible for an excessive production of free radicals . The following oxidative stress is exacerbated by a lack of antioxidant substances that have not yet matured . At the moment there are no therapeutic strategies with single or combined antioxidants that have been shown to be clinically effective . Breastfeeding is important for the contribution of the antioxidant defenses of the newborn and the nutritional status of the mother plays a key role because it influences the nutritional status of the newborn . Lutein is a carotenoid that is not produced by the body , but taken with food or supplements . The molecule carries out different activities : antioxidant , anti-inflammatory , anticancer , neuroprotective . Its main activity of inhibition of peroxidation of membrane lipids is peculiarly important for the photoreceptors and neurons whose membranes are rich with polyunsaturated fatty acids . Current evidence on its role as an antioxidant indicate that supplementation with lutein may play a significant role in the prevention of free radical disease in the newborn","In recent years many scientific studies demonstrated that lutein , a nutrient belonging to the family of carotenoids , may constitute a valid and important preventive and protective factor against a large number of chronic diseases affecting millions of people around the world . Studies from literature highlight and confirm that lutein is able to reduce the risk of developing some ocular diseases or slow down their progression . Lutein is a fat-soluble derivative of polar hydroxylated xanthophyll which belongs to the family of carotenoids . Carotenoids are linear polyenes , ie double bonds conjugated hydrocarbons containing 40 atoms of carbon . Today there are 35 known carotenoids that are ingested , absorbed , metabolised and found in human serum . Lutein is the most important corotenoid and it is only in the retina , in the macula and in the lens . In tissues and serum lutein is found together with its isomer , the zeaxanthin . Lutein , commonly ingested with other foods , is partially eliminated directly in the faeces ( 50-90 % ) and partially absorbed with fatty foods . It is incorporated into chylomicrons reaching the blood where it binds some lipoprotein and thanks to its fat solubility it reaches different organs : liver , breast , colon , cervix , lens , iris and the retina where it is concentrated in the central region : the macula . Inside cells Lutein is placed through the lipid bilayer binding its polar groups with those of cell membranes . Lutein and zeaxanthin are present in the umbilical cord and pass through the placental barrier . They are also found in high concentrations in breast milk ( higher than in plasma ) , particularly in colostrum ; indicating an active secretion in milk . The rates of lutein in blood increases of 67 % versus 14 % for beta-carotene after the intake of foods rich in carotenoids . Coordinated and interdisciplinary studies , conducted both in vitro and in vivo , have shown that lutein plays a role in tissues defense through a functional mechanisms using the phenomenon of deactivation ( quenching ) of singlet oxygen and of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) . This action gives the molecule different activities : antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties , promotion of anti-carcinogenic effects , induction of detoxifying enzymes and promotion of proteins with a positive effect on the junctional communication ( up-regulation ) . New chemical and experimental data show that oxidative stress and harmful effects of ROS may play an important role in the pathogenesis of some neurological diseases like Alzheimer , Parkinson , etc .. This could be explained by the fact that the central nervous system is characterized by membranes rich of polyunsaturated lipids that are the first target of ROS attack ( lipid peroxidation ) . A similar mechanism may occur in some ocular tissues ( macula , lens , retina ) , which are more vulnerable than other tissues to oxidative damage being particularly rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids . The photo-protective action seems to be predominant in the iris , while in the retinal pigment epithelium may operate both light filtering and antioxidant mechanisms . The development of the human eye includes a complex series of consecutive events beginning with the first differentiation of the fertilized egg cell and continuing after birth until the first years of life . The eye of the newborn , although smaller than that of adults , has a well developed and mature dioptric apparatus , consisting of cornea , aqueous humor , lens and vitreous , transparent structures that allow the passage of light and focus images on the retina . Contrariwise the macula and its central part ( fovea ) , useful for vision and color discrimination , are not yet mature at birth . The full development of the fovea occurs only after the 4 / 5 month of life . This process along with the development of more sensitive ways , gives to the child a greater resolving power and a distinct vision . The partial pressure of blood gases that regulates blood flow to the retina has the same importance . Indeed oxygen consumption by the retina is constant and a defect or an excess of this gas can be highly detrimental for the natural development of retinal structures . An example of the importance of oxygen partial pressure in regulating retinal blood flow is represented by retinopathy of prematurity ( ROP ) , an usually bilateral condition , affecting the immature retinal vessels . ROP has been one of the major cause of blindness in infants in the past . Nowadays the use of oxygen concentrations based on the levels of its partial pressure in the arterial blood , has reduced the incidence of retinopathy . The vascularization of the retina begins on the 4th month of gestation . The vessels progress from the center to the periphery , reaching the nasal area at the 8th month and the temporal at the 9th month of intrauterine life . In the retinopathy of prematurity , the development of retinal vasculature is impaired because the increase in PA02 levels leads to an arteriolar vasoconstriction and to the obliteration of the newly formed capillaries . Consequently the mesenchyme stops to proliferate , forming a marginal tissue . The arteries and veins of this margin does not drain their blood in capillaries , but in small arteriovenous anastomosis forming shunt . The endothelium of these new vessels is also very permeable because it is immature and incomplete . The capillary bed of the shunt is largely obliterated , and this causes anomalies of pressure responsible of dilation and tortuosity , microaneurysms , neovascularization and resulting in exudative and haemorrhagic phenomena with the possibility of developing vitreous traction and retinal detachment . This represents the active phase of the disease , which often regresses spontaneously , and the magnitude of which depends on the precocity of hyperoxia . The evolution could be the regression , the scarring , or more frequently , a combination between the two . During pregnancy , the percentage of fatty acids in maternal plasma increases to 51 % . The polyunsaturated fatty acids are significantly prone to oxidation , the changes in their plasma levels affect the status of the antioxidant systems in pregnant and consequently in the newborn . Several studies reported that the increased susceptibility to peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids in pregnancy is accompanied by an equivalent increase in plasma tocopherol levels but its level decreases dramatically immediately after birth . Plasma antioxidant levels of the newborn were found lower if compared with those of the mother . Tocopherols and carotenoids levels are significantly lower in the umbilical cord than those recorded in maternal plasma and the concentration of polyunsaturated fatty acids in the newborn is higher than that of the mother . Many scientific studies have also shown an increasing interest in oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species that accumulate after birth . OS is assessed by the quantification of thiobarbituric acid reactive species ( TBRS ) in plasma . TBRS levels were significantly increased in premature infants after the exposure to blue light for 96 hours . Studies on premature infants have shown a correlation between low plasma levels of antioxidants and an increased risk of free-radical relates diseases . Therefore it could be useful to increase antioxidant defenses in infants in order to restore the redox unbalance and to prevent the damage caused by a prolonged exposure to high levels of free radicals and reactive oxygen species . Oxidative stress is considered one of the main determinants of retinal damage as in age-related diseases . A proper balance between oxidant and antioxidant factors may help to prevent or reduce eye damage that can occur in newborns , especially in preterm infants , such as ROP . Indeed preterm babies are often exposed to potentially harmful concentrations of oxygen due to respiratory problems or undergo phototherapy with high intensity blue light . These therapies are sources of free radicals . Lutein and zeaxanthin in the macular pigment , may play an important role in protecting the eyes of the newborn from the damage of light thanks to their ability to absorb blue light and their antioxidant action . Lutein increases macular pigment density and can protect through two synergistic mechanisms : the absorption of blue light before it reaches the sensitive retinal structures , namely the photoreceptors inducing a photochemical damage , the quencing effect that determines the neutralization of singlet oxygen and of other free radicals . There are many evidences that suggest a protective effect of lutein against photo-oxidation damage in adult ( Leeuwen 2006 , AREDS 1 , AREDS 2 ) . Lutein and zeaxanthin are present in the umbilical cord and several studies have shown that there is a direct correlation between mother and newborn plasma levels of lutein . Lutein is also present in breast milk in concentrations three times higher than other carotenoids with the same plasma concentrations . There is also a correlation between plasma levels of lutein in the mother and levels in the breastfed infant . Studies on infants have shown that carotenoids levels in the first four/six months of life are very low . This is probably due to the fact that the infants diet is entirely made of milk without solid foods ( such as green leafy vegetables ) sources of this nutrient . Children breastfed have higher lutein plasma levels than children fed with formula milk . The different types of formula milks are currently not enriched with these carotenoids and their content of both lutein and zeaxanthin is very low , except for some formulations which are prepared using egg homogenate but they are not sold in Italy . Breast milk is therefore the only source of lutein for infants before the weaning , and the breastfeeding is very important as a primary source of these nutrients for the proper development and protection of the vision . Considering the correlation between lutein content in plasma and in breast milk and the lowering of lutein levels in milk already six days after birth , it is really important to take foods rich in lutein during lactation . A diet enriched with lutein is especially important for mothers of premature or low birth weight newborns . Indeed the premature and underweight children need many nutrients essential for a rapid growth because they did not receive highly nutritious elements and energy transferred from the mother during the last weeks of gestation . Moreover , their gastrointestinal and renal functions are not fully developed and this could reduce the absorption and retention of some micronutrients including important antioxidants that protect the infant from exposure to high levels of free radicals produced in excess at birth and often as a result of the resuscitation technics used . Breastfeeding is important for the intake of antioxidant defenses in the newborn and the nutritional status of the mother plays certainly a key role because it affects the nutritional status of the infant , and especially the status of some soluble nutrients such as lutein and zeaxanthin . The preparations of lutein and zeaxanthin have never had gastrointestinal or systemic toxic effects in humans after supplementation . In recent studies , no adverse effects after administration of 20 mg/day of lutein or zeaxanthin administered for 6 months or interactions with other fat-soluble nutrients were reported .",2014-02-17,"February 24, 2014","Inclusion Criteria : healthy singleton term newborns discharged on third day of life whose mothers had low-obstetric risk and with normal adaptation to extrauterine life Exclusion Criteria : The exclusion criteria included newborns with severe malformations , suffering from perinatal hypoxia or born to mothers with mental disorders",100,0,1 Minute,5 Minutes

Erasmus Medical Center,NCT02060474,Thyroid Hormone Analog Therapy in MCT8 Deficiency: Triac Trial Patients,Erasmus Medical Center,2,1,Allan-Herndon-Dudley Syndrome,Drug,Triac,Treatment,,"This therapeutical trial will be conducted in patients with the Allan-Herndon-Dudley Syndrome ( AHDS ) , which is mutations in MCT8 . MCT8 is a thyroid hormone ( TH ) transporter which is crucial for the transport of TH from the blood into different tissues . Dysfunction of MCT8 results in a lack of TH ( hypothyroidism ) in tissues that depend on MCT8 for TH uptake . This local hypothyroidism in the brain of these patients causes severe psychomotor retardation . In addition , TH serum parameters are highly abnormal in AHDS : high T3 , low T4 and normal TSH levels . The high serum T3 levels cause local hyperthyroidism in tissues that do not depend on MCT8 for cellular transport of TH , resulting in a low body weight and reduced muscle mass . Currently , no adequate treatment is available for the AHDS . A T3 analog that does not depend on MCT8 for its cellular entry could , at least partially , restore the abnormalities found in AHDS . Several in vivo , in vitro and animal studies have shown that the T3 analog Triac is a very promising candidate : Triac binds to the same TH receptors as T3 ; Cellular uptake of Triac does not depend on functional MCT8 . Hence , in AHDS patients Triac will also be available in tissues that require functional MCT8 for TH uptake , e.g . the brain ; In vitro studies have shown that neuronal cells differentiate equally well in the presence of either Triac or T3 ; In Mct8 deficient mice , Triac is taken up by the brain and suppresses serum TSH levels ; consequently , serum T3 and T4 levels were lowered ; Triac is the treatment of choice in patient with the resistance to thyroid hormone ( RTH ) syndrome . Patient with RTH have high serum TSH and thyroid hormone levels , which shows strong similarities to the profile found in AHDS patients ; the longstanding experience with Triac in RTH indicates its safety and tolerability . Thus , Triac treatment could result in normalization of the abnormal serum TH values in AHDS patients . Furthermore , Triac could replace the function of T3 in tissues that depend on MCT8 for TH uptake ( e.g . brain ) . The current trial will investigate if Triac treatment in ADHS patients reduces the toxic effects of the high T3 levels restores the local TH deficiency in brain .","All patients were treated with Triac ( Téatrois tablets 350 microgram , Rare Thyroid Therapeutics ) by individualized dose-escalation , following a pre-defined dose-escalation protocol . After the initial dose of Triac ( 350 microgram ) was administered and no predefined dose-limiting toxicities were observed , the daily dose was increased progressively in 350 microgram steps , with a goal of attaining serum total T3 concentrations within the target range of 1·4-2·5 nmol per liter . The maintenance Triac dose was continued throughout the rest of the study period , but could be further adjusted according to the dose-escalation protocol if T3 concentrations were outside the target range during control visits . Patients were assessed for study outcomes at baseline and 12 months after starting Triac administration . In the interval , patients were evaluated and screened for clinical and biochemical signs of hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism , adverse events were recorded and adherence to therapy was assessed . All study procedures were specified in standard operating procedures , and were performed by well-trained investigators . Neuropsychological tests were conducted according to their manual . All biochemical measurements were performed in a central laboratory ( Erasmus Medical Centre ) .

In a previous study , the NCI Surgery Branch used the anti-ESO-1 gene and a type of virus ( retrovirus ) to make these tumor-fighting cells ( anti-ESO-1 cells ) . About half of the patients who received this treatment experienced shrinking of their tumors . In this study , we are using a slightly different method of producing the anti-ESO-1 cells selected for a specific cell type , which we hope , will be better in making the tumors shrink . Objectives : The purpose of this study is to see if these tumor fighting cells ( genetically modified cells ) that express the receptor for the ESO-1 molecule on their surface can cause melanoma tumors to shrink and to see if this treatment is safe . Eligibility : -Adults 18 and older with cancer that has the ESO-1 molecule on tumor surfaces Design : Work up stage : Patients will be seen as an outpatient at the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) clinical Center and undergo a history and physical examination , scans , x-rays , lab tests , and other tests as needed Leukapheresis : If the patients meet all of the requirements for the study they will undergo leukapheresis to obtain white blood cells to make the anti ESO-1 cells . { Leukapheresis is a common procedure , which removes only the white blood cells from the patient . } Treatment : Once their cells have grown , the patients will be admitted to the hospital for the conditioning chemotherapy , the anti-ESO 1 cells and aldesleukin . They will stay in the hospital for about 4 weeks for the treatment . Follow up : Patients will return to the clinic for a physical exam , review of side effects , lab tests , and scans about every 1-3 months for the first year , and then every 6 months to 1 year as long as their tumors are shrinking . Follow up visits take up to 2 days .","Background : A T cell receptor ( TCR ) that recognizes the NY-ESO-1 ( ESO ) tumor/testes antigen has been cloned into a retrovirus and can be used to genetically modify human peripheral blood lymphocytes ( PBL ) so they recognize human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) -A2+ , ESO+ tumors PBL expressing the anti-ESO TCR have been administered with aldesleukin with or without ALVAC vaccine to 21 patients with melanoma following lymphodepleting chemotherapy at the Surgery Branch , resulting in objective tumor regression ( complete or partial regression ) in ten patients ( 47 % ) . In animal models using murine cells and in experiments with human T cells in vitro , T cell subsets expressing the lymphoid homing and differentiation marker cluster of differentiation 62L ( CD62L ) , including na ( SqrRoot ) ve T cells ( TNaive ) , stem cell memory T cells ( TSCM ) , and central memory T cells ( TCM ) , were shown to have superior attributes compared to whole PBL and CD62L- PBL for adoptive cell therapy , including superior persistence following transfer in vivo . Objectives : Primary objective : - To determine whether the administration of anti-ESO TCR engineered CD62L+-derived lymphocytes plus high-dose aldesleukin following a non-myeloablative lymphodepleting preparative regimen can result in an objective regression rate ( partial response ( PR ) + complete response ( CR ) ) of melanoma tumors . Secondary objectives : Determine the persistence of genetically engineered , adoptively transferred CD62L+ derived lymphocytes . Determine the toxicity profile of this treatment regimen . Eligibility : Patients who are : Human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) -A * 0201 positive 18 years of age or older Have metastatic melanoma that expresses the ESO antigen Patients may not have : - Contraindications for high dose aldesleukin administration . Design : Peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) will be obtained by leukapheresis and will undergo positive selection for CD62L using a CliniMACS magnetic cell separation apparatus to enrich for the less differentiated TNaive , TSCM , and TCM subsets . The enriched CD62L+ lymphocytes will be cultured in the presence of anti-CD3 ( OKT3 ) and aldesleukin in order to stimulate T-cell growth , then transduced with the anti-ESO TCR . All patients will receive a non-myeloablative lymphocyte depleting preparative regimen of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine . On day 0 patients will receive anti-ESO TCR gene-transduced CD62L+ -derived lymphocytes and then begin high dose aldesleukin . A complete evaluation of evaluable lesions will be conducted 6 weeks ( +/- 2 weeks ) following the administration of the cell product . The primary objective will be efficacy . The study will be conducted using a phase II optimal design ( Simon R , Controlled Clinical Trials 10:1-10 , 1989 ) in order to rule out an unacceptably low 40 % overall response rate ( p0=0.40 ) in favor of an improved response rate of 65 % ( p1=0.65 ) . This study will initially enroll 11 evaluable patients , and if 0 to 5 of the 11 have a response , then no further patients will be accrued . If 6 or more of the first 11 patients have a response , then accrual would continue until a total of 20 patients have been enrolled . If there were 11 or more responses in 20 patients ( 55 % ) , this would be sufficiently interesting to warrant further study in later trials . To allow for a very small number of inevaluable patients , the accrual ceiling will be set at 22 patients .",2014-02-12,"May 19, 2016","-INCLUSION CRITERIA : Measurable metastatic melanoma that expresses ESO as assessed by one of the following methods : reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) on tumor tissue , or by immunohistochemistry of resected tissue , or serum antibody reactive with ESO .

"University of Maryland, Baltimore",NCT02067975,Tryptophan MRI in People With Schizophrenia and Healthy Controls,"University of Maryland, Baltimore",2,1,Schizophrenia,Drug,Tryptophan,Treatment,Triple,"Kynurenic acid ( KYNA ) is a naturally occurring chemical in the brain . Studies with rodents indicate that levels of KYNA can impact levels of the neurotransmitters glutamate and dopamine . One way to reliably increase KYNA levels is by ingesting the amino acid tryptophan . Tryptophan is a normal part of the human diet . Tryptophan gets metabolized/changed to other chemicals in the body- including KYNA . By giving people 6 grams of tryptophan , the investigators will be able to increase the KYNA level in a controlled way . The investigators will then be able to study the effects of KYNA on neurotransmitters by using cognitive tests and magnetic resonance imaging techniques ( measuring brain activity and brain chemistry using the MRI magnet ) . They will test people using tryptophan and also using a placebo to look for differences . The investigators will test healthy controls and people with schizophrenia to look for differences .","There is emerging evidence to suggest that disturbances in the kynurenine pathway may be related to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia . Several post-mortem studies have documented specific abnormalities in the kynurenine pathway , including increased levels of kynurenine and kynurenic acid ( KYNA ) in the prefrontal cortex of people with schizophrenia ( 1-4 ) . Increased levels of kynurenine and KYNA have also been observed in the cerebral spinal fluid ( CSF ) of people with this illness ( 5 ) . In addition , post-mortem studies have documented changes in key enzymes , including increased expression of tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase ( 2 , 6 ) ( TDO ) , which converts tryptophan to kynurenine , and reduced activity of kynurenine 3-monooxygenase ( KMO ) ( 4 ) , which may shift metabolism towards enhanced KYNA formation . Finally , a number of genetic studies have implicated the KYNA pathway in this disease . Wonodi et al . ( 7 ) found decreased KMO gene expression in the frontal eye field of people with schizophrenia , and Holtze et al . ( 8 ) recently reported an association between a KMO SNP and CSF levels of KYNA . Notably , although the exact mechanism underlying the KP impairment in people with schizophrenia is unknown , immune and stress mechanisms have been implicated ( 7,9 ) . Increased KYNA may have a number of adverse consequences of importance in schizophrenia . In particular , KYNA is an antagonist of the α7 nicotinic and NMDA glutamate receptors . Dysfunctions of these receptors have been linked to the cognitive impairments and symptom manifestations observed in people with schizophrenia . The purpose of the proposed project is to examine the impact of increased brain KYNA on performance of cognitive tasks and related neuroimaging measures in people with DSM-5/DSM-IV-TR schizophrenia , schizophreniform , or schizoaffective disorder patients and healthy controls . In addition , the investigators will secondarily investigate the relationship of peripheral inflammatory markers and glucocorticoid levels as part of the HPA stress axis to examine relationships and shift to a Type 2 immune response in schizophrenia . Using tryptophan loading to increase KYNA levels , the study will test the hypothesis , based on complementary preliminary studies in rodents , that disease-related cognitive deficits in people with schizophrenia are preferentially susceptible to ( further ) elevations in KYNA levels . The investigators hypothesize that tryptophan-induced elevations in brain KYNA levels will : 1 ) acutely impair performance on measures of verbal and visual memory , attention , working memory , and processing speed in people with schizophrenia ; 2 ) alter dorsolateral-hippocampal activation and connectivity , which underlies the performance of the relational memory task ; and 3 ) decrease mPFC MRS measures of glutamate , consistent with preclinical microdialysis data . In an exploratory framework , the investigators hypothesize that increased brain KYNA levels alter default network activation and connectivity , an effect which may be mediated by the action of KYNA on α7 nicotinic and/or NMDA receptors . The investigators will also investigate the extent to which cytokine and HPA axis peripheral measures are related to the effect of tryptophan-induced elevated KYNA levels on cognitive performance and fMRI and MRS measures . Comparisons with results from healthy controls will determine if participants with schizophrenia have an aberrant or exaggerated response to increased KYNA levels .

Osmotic laxatives such as Colyte® are administered 2 days prior , and Nothing by mouth ( NPO ) is required 1 day prior to ensure no fecal residue is left in the bowel . Though it may ensure a cleaner and safer surgery , this longer period of starvation increases insulin resistance and may increase post-op complications . However , there is evidence that administration of oral rehydration solution ( ORS ) prior to surgery reduces insulin resistance .

University of Florida,NCT02069431,Oxytocin Aging Study,University of Florida,1,0,Inflammation,Drug,Intranasal Oxytocin spray,Treatment,Quadruple,"The life expectancy of older Americans continues to increase , with persons aged > 65 years representing the fastest growing segment of the US population ( Manton et al. , 1995 ) . While prolongation of life remains an important public health goal , a goal of even greater significance is that extended life should involve preservation of the capacity to live independently and to function well physically , cognitively , and socioemotionally ( Katz et al. , 1983 ) . Therefore , identification of proven interventions to maintaining functioning across these domains and prevent disability is a major public health challenge ( Branch et al. , 1991 ) . Greater physical and cognitive independence in older adults has been shown to crucially influence social integration in old age ( Cornwell & Waite , 2009 ) , resulting in significant increase in quality of life and reduction of risk for morbidity and mortality , social stress , anxiety , and depressive symptoms ( Bassuk et al. , 1999 ; Seeman , 1996 ) . A promising candidate to promote functional levels across physical , cognitive , and socioemotional domains is the neuropeptide oxytocin ( OT ) ( Barraza et al. , 2013 ; Bartz et al. , 2011 ; Feifel et al. , 2012 ; Meyer-Lindenberg et al. , 2011 ; Szeto et al. , 2012 ) . Combining neuroendocrine with behavioral approaches ( e.g. , performance-based measures of physical and cognitive function ) , the proposed multidisciplinary research therefore sets out to clarify the extent to which intranasal administration of OT over a period of 4 weeks can reduce inflammation and improve physical and cognitive function in older men . Constituting a complementary piece to the IRB approved currently ongoing Faces Study ( IRB # 39-2013 ) , this project will also allow examination of interactions between OT 's effect on physical health , cognition , and socioemotional function .","Overview : Initial screening visit 3 baseline study visits 4-week treatment phase 3 study visits after treatment Follow-up phone contact All study visits will be conducted at the Institute on Aging or the McKnight Brain Institute at the University of Florida . The treatment phase will take place in the participant 's home . The participant will be assigned by chance to receive either the oxytocin or the placebo . The placebo is a substance , like salt water , that looks like and is given in the same way as the oxytocin but contains no oxytocin . Neither the participant nor the research assistant will know which type of dose they are getting . This information is coded and securely stored away until the data is analyzed , but that information is available if it is needed . Screening Visit : Together with the information obtained in the phone pre-screening that the investigators have already conducted , the main purpose of the screening visit is to find out if the participant is eligible to participate in the study . The investigators will ask the participant questions about their health condition and recent activities and the investigators will review the participant 's current and past medical health as well as their education and living situation . The participant will then have a short physical exam by a licensed physician including measurement of blood pressure and pulse , and a brief consultation to go over the participant 's medical review . This will not be a clinical doctor visit for routine medical care , but a visit to confirm the participant 's eligibility to participate in the study . Next , the participant 's vision will be tested . The participant will be asked to view a rotating C-shape and identify the direction of the break in the C faces . The C will get larger and smaller depending on the participant 's response and in another task the shade of grey for the C and the background will vary . Then the physical status of the participant will be determined based on the following activities : The participant will be asked to walk at his/her usual pace for a distance of 13 feet ( 4 meters ) two ( 2 ) separate times . The participant will be asked to stand from a sitting position , without using their arms . If they are able to perform this task , they will be asked to stand up from and sit down on a chair five ( 5 ) times as fast as they can . The participant will be asked to maintain their balance while standing in three different positions , 1 ) with feet together , 2 ) with the heel of one foot beside the big toe of the other foot , and 3 ) the heel of one foot in front of and touching the toes of the other foot . A blood draw ( ~30milileters or ~2 tablespoons ) and urine collection ( ~2mL or ~0.14 tbs ) will follow . Result of blood or/and urine testing may indicate that the participant should not participate in the study . The blood test will also be used to determine the level of oxytocin occurring normally in the participant 's blood and to determine level of inflammation in their body . If any incidental or clinically significant findings occur , the investigator will inform you of this and give you a copy of the lab results . The participant will also be encouraged to see their primary care physician . Some of the blood and a saliva sample ( ~2mL or ~ 0.14 tbs ) that the participant will be asked to provide will help to find out how the activity of their genes may impact how they perform on some tests . All samples will be stored in a locked space at the Institute on Aging . Baseline Visit 1 : The investigator will ask the participant to engage in a series of tests and answer questionnaires related to physical , auditory ( hearing ) , and social and emotional functioning . The first test is a learning and remembering task . This is followed by a Physical Test Battery : The participant will be asked to walk for 6 minutes . The participant will also be asked to walk a distance of 33 feet ( 10 meters ) three times . They will be asked to walk the same distance another three times while counting out loud . The participant will be asked to perform upper- and lower-body muscle strength and endurance assessment The participant will be asked to respond to various questionnaires related to their physical health . Auditory Test Battery o The participant will be asked to complete tasks that require them to listen and attend to desired stimuli in the presence of a competing message or noise . Socioemotional Test Battery o The participant will be asked to complete questionnaires to measure their social and emotional health , which will include questions to measure their current mood , their general level of trust , their level of loneliness , and their drive to identify emotions and thoughts in others and to respond to these with an appropriate emotion . These questions will also measure the participant 's selflessness and concern for the well-being of others , their emotional attention and clarity , their anxiety level , and personality . Baseline Visit 2 : At the beginning of this visit , we will ask the participant about recent activities . The participant will then be asked to participate in an electroencephalography ( EEG ) recording session , that is a recording of electrical activity along their scalp . An EEG cap , selected for the participant 's head size , will be placed on their head . The cap contains small electrodes that record brain electrical activity . During this part of the study , the participant will sit in a chair while watching pictures on a computer screen and listening to sounds through headphones , or resting . While recording EEG , the participant 's eye movements will be monitored with an eye tracker . The eye-tracking camera will be placed in front of them and after a brief calibration procedure will track the participant 's eye movements while viewing stimuli on the screen and hearing sounds . Before the tasks start , the participant will receive detailed information and have a chance to ask any questions that they may have about the tasks or about the EEG and eye tracking procedures . The participant will also have the chance to work on some practice trials . After the EEG and eye tracking recording , the investigator will then ask the participant about the amount of pain they experienced in the last 6 months . This will be followed by brief sensory testing . In particular , the investigator will apply pressure to several sites on the participant 's face and body . The pressure will be slowly increased , and the participant will be asked to tell the investigator when they begin to feel discomfort or mild pain . As soon as the participant indicates that they feel pain , the pressure will be removed . Also , the investigator will tap the participant with a small nylon tip on their knee and the back of their hand and will ask the participant to indicate how painful this feels . The investigator will do that twice at each site . Baseline Visit 3 : At the beginning of this visit , the investigator will ask the participant about their recent activities . If the participant is assigned to the MRI/MRS portion of the study the investigator will ensure that they are eligible and safe to participate in the scanning session that day . The participant will then practice the tasks that they will work on while in the MRI scanner . The tasks will involve viewing geometrical shapes , faces , and images of objects and scenes . The participant will receive detailed information and have a chance to ask any questions that they may have about the tasks or about the MRI procedure before they go into the scanner . At this point , the participant will be shuttled to the McKnight Brain Institute , and get settled into the MRI scanner , all with the assistance of the trained researcher . While the participant is resting comfortably in the scanner , the investigator will ask them to work on the tasks mentioned above and while they do the MRI machine will produce images of their brain , as well as scan their brain at rest . The participant will be in the scanner for less than 60 minutes . The investigator will ask the participant to engage in a series of tests and respond to questionnaires related to their memory and thought process . This Cognitive Test Battery comprises : Tasks that ask the participant to attend to , respond to , or remember various stimuli on the computer screen and on paper . Intervention Phase : The participant will self-administer either oxytocin or a placebo into their nose by using a nasal spray bottle . The spray will be administered twice a day over 4 weeks . The investigator will give the participant guidance about how to administer the spray and will ask them to keep a log book of their oxytocin/placebo administration . In addition , during the treatment phase the investigator will ask the participant to fill in a short diary about social activities they engaged in during their day as well as emotions they experienced . In Week 1 and 4 of the intervention phase , the participant will be fitted with a device ( i.e. , bio-harness ) that allows the investigator to measure physiological functions of the participant 's body such as their heart rate and breathing rate , for over a period of 24 hours while the participant engages in their daily activities . The participant will be asked to wear it on a typical day , representative of their normal daily activity . The 24-hour period will be one in which the participant is not traveling out of town . A trained research assistant will visit the participant in their home to fit them with and take off the bio-harness . The bio-harness will be comfortably fitted with a chest strap around the participant 's upper body . It generally will not affect the clothes the participant can wear , it is water resistant , and the participant will be able to pursue the large majority of their daily activities in the usual manner . During the treatment phase , research assistants will call the participant once a week to ask whether they experience any drug side effects or any problem with their health . Post-Treatment Visit 1 : The investigator will ask the participant questions about their health condition and recent activities . The participant will again be physically examined ( including vitals ) under the supervision of a licensed physician . Another blood draw ( ~30mL or ~2 tbs ) will be conducted to run blood tests and determine the level of oxytocin after the treatment phase as well as the level of inflammation in the participant 's body . Urine ( ~2mL or ~0.14 tbs ) will be collected again to ensure that no adverse changes have occurred during the treatment phase . The samples will be stored in a locked space at the Institute on Aging . The investigator will again ask the participant to engage in a series of tests and respond to questionnaires related to recent activities as well as physical , auditory ( hearing ) , and their social and emotional functioning . These measures will be very similar to the ones they did before the intervention phase . Post-Intervention Visit 2 : At the beginning of this visit , the investigator will ask the participant about recent activities . The investigator will ask the participant to participate in ERP and eye tracking recordings similar to the ones before the treatment phase . The investigator will also ask the participant to engage in a series of tests and respond to questionnaires related to their memory and thought process . These measures will be very similar to the ones they did before the treatment phase . This will be followed by brief sensory testing , similar to the one that took place before the treatment phase . Post-Intervention Visit 3 : At the beginning of this visit , the investigator will ask the participant about recent activities . If the participant is assigned for the MRI/MRS portion of the study the investigator will ensure that the participant is eligible and safe to participate in the scanning session that day . The participant will then practice the tasks that they will work on while in the MRI scanner , which will be similar to the ones they engaged in before the treatment phase . At this point , the participant will be shuttled to the McKnight Brain Institute , and get settled into the MRI scanner , all with the assistance of the trained researcher . The participant will again be in the scanner for less than 60 minutes . The investigator will ask the participant to engage in a series of tests and respond to questionnaires related to their memory and thought process , similar to the ones they engaged in before the treatment phase . Upon completion of the study , the investigator will tell the participant about the general goals of the study and answer any questions that they may have 1-Week Follow-Up Phone Call : A research assistant will call the participant about one week after the participant 's last study visit to inquire whether they experienced any drug side effects or any health problems . The genetic material that is obtained from the blood , saliva , and urine samples will be stored until the end of the study . By temporarily storing the genetic material , the investigator will be able to examine the importance of different oxytocin genes as well as other genes that are not yet known as being involved in how people think and behave . When there is no longer sufficient amounts of blood , saliva , and urine samples for analysis , or samples become degraded , or the participant requests in writing that the sample be destroyed , any remaining genetic material will be destroyed . The genetic material will only be accessible to the research staff and will be labeled only by an identification number , not the participant 's name . The University of Florida will not sell the samples and will not use the DNA for cloning .",2014-02-10,"June 17, 2020",Inclusion Criteria : males and females aged 55 years or older generally healthy physically and cognitively blood pressure < 180/100 mm Hg willing and able to give informed consent .

Microorganisms can be cultured from 18-48 % of draining mesenteric lymph nodes from CD patients . A breakdown in barrier function in `` late stage '' CD has been observed in patients requiring surgery . In addition , it was found that BT influences the response to biological therapy and clinical relapse in CD . Therefore , reducing BT may be of therapeutic importance in treatment for CD . The role of soluble dietary fiber in Crohn 's disease ( CD ) is still inconclusive . Population based studies have shown that long-term intake of dietary fiber is associated with lower risk of CD . However , meta-analysis did not show benefit in inducing or maintaining remission . In addition , the possible mechanism of dietary fiber on CD is still unclear . The rationale relates to the beneficial effects of fiber may be due to the production of the fiber metabolites short-chain fatty acids ( SCFAs ) , particularly butyrate . Dietary substrates may modify the commensal microbiota or their metabolites or enhance epithelial barrier function .

Massachusetts General Hospital,NCT02160288,Effects of Botox in Obstructed Defecation Syndrome,Massachusetts General Hospital,2,0,Obstructed Defecation Syndrome (ODS),Drug,Botulinum Toxin-A,Treatment,Triple,The purpose of this study is to determine if Botulinum Toxin-A ( Botox ) injection will improve symptoms of constipation in obstructed defecation syndrome ( ODS ) .,"Constipation represents one of the five most common physician diagnoses for gut disorders . Obstructed defecation syndrome ( ODS ) is an under-treated condition which accounts for 30 % - 50 % of all patients with constipation and it is more common as people age . ODS is due to the abnormal contraction of the puborectalis muscle ( a muscle around the anus that should relax during defecation ) . Biofeedback therapy and medical management are the standards of care for ODS . Typically patients are first managed with dietary modifications ( fiber supplementation , increased fluids ) and medication ( laxatives , enemas ) . If constipation is not improved , they will undergo biofeedback , which lasts from 3-8 sessions on average . Biofeedback acts on the cause of ODS and it has good short-term success , but around 50 % -70 % of treated patients re-experience constipation after one year . The main drawbacks of biofeedback for ODS are the facts that it is expensive , time-consuming , available in few select-centers and its success depends very much on the provider . Biofeedback is delivered in multiple 1-hour clinic sessions , so many patients do n't finish all recommended sessions and their constipation may recur faster . Botox also acts on the cause of ODS and was shown to improve constipation within 1-3 weeks after the injection . Botox is delivered as a one-time injection in the puborectalis muscle and external anal sphincter ( the muscle right around the anus ) . The injection can be performed in the clinic under local anesthesia , and the patient goes home afterwards . Currently , Botox is used for treatment of patients who fail biofeedback and medical management , to avoid the options of last resort ( resection of the colon with stoma ) . To this day , no adequately designed study has confirmed that Botox is indeed superior to placebo ( normal saline ) for the treatment of ODS . The results from this study will provide valuable data on the ability of Botox to improve symptoms of constipation and the duration of its effect . This project has the potential to increase the availability of effective treatments for ODS .",2014-06-03,"May 7, 2020",Inclusion Criteria : Males and females 18 years or older of all races and backgrounds Competent to give informed consent Meet the Rome III diagnostic criteria for functional constipation Inability to relax the puborectalis muscle at electromyography Altomare Obstructed Defecation Syndrome score of 15 points or above Failure of treatment with 2 conservative measures which may be as follows : 1 laxative ( osmotic or stimulant ) for 2 weeks 1 fiber supplement for one month And/or trial of biofeedback for at least 4 sessions Exclusion Criteria : Previous treatment with Botox ( possible antibodies ) Known hypersensitivity to any of the components of the toxin Medication regimen includes narcotics Previous radiation therapy to the anal canal and rectum Prior proctectomy Presence of unhealed and symptomatic anal fissure Presence of anal pain Presence of fecal incontinence Presence of full thickness rectal prolapse Presence of internal sphincter myopathy Inflammatory bowel disease or proctitis Pregnancy or breast-feeding Subject is currently enrolled/ just finished participating in a clinical trial in which the intervention/ its carry-over effect may interact with the intervention in this trial,1,0,18 Years,90 Years

Small studies have been unable to show clear benefit of the use of low dose anticoagulation in SCD due to limited sample size or the inclusion of very specific populations . However , studies have shown a decrease in the level of elevated prothrombotic markers with anticoagulation , and one study using full dose anticoagulation in patients with a generally milder form of SCD ( with high protective hemoglobin ) showed more rapid decrease in clinical pain with use of anticoagulation , suggesting a possible benefit of such therapy . Due to the paucity of data to support therapeutic dose LMWH in the more severe forms of SCD seen in the United States , we have chosen prophylactic dose anticoagulation . This study proposal attempts to critically avoid admissions by reducing daily pain scores and pain crisis as an outpatient by use of a novel oral anticoagulant . The development of novel anticoagulants such as oral direct factor Xa ( FXa ) inhibitors allows the realistic use of daily prophylactic dosing as an outpatient . Past studies as detailed earlier have been limited by attempts to use subcutaneous injections or frequent , close monitoring for acenocoumarol treatment , both which are not ideal for chronic daily use . Furthermore , the use of global assays such calibrated automated thrombography ( CAT ) have shown further details about thrombin generation in a population which is hypercoagulable at baseline . This is a double blind , parallel group , placebo controlled feasibility study with an enrollment target of 25 patients ( 12 per arm ) . All subjects that meet inclusion criteria as an outpatient , following a 1 month observation , will be randomized to receive an oral prophylactic dose factor Xa inhibitor ( Apixaban 2.5mg po bid ) or placebo for 6 months . Subjects will return for a 30 day ( +/- 5 days ) follow-up visit after the End of Treatment ( EOT ) visit .

Study design : A prospective , randomized , double-blind , clinical trial was carried out involving 120 patients divided in three groups : Group 1 ( diazepam and placebo ) , Group 2 ( midazolam and placebo ) and Group 3 ( diazepam and midazolam ) . Each subject underwent two surgeries on separate occasions under local anesthesia .","Study design A double-blind , randomized , crossover , clinical trial with a split-mouth design was carried out . This study received approval from the Human Research Ethics Committee of the institution at which it was carried out ( process number : 001.0.097.000-08 ) and was conducted in compliance with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials ( CONSORT ) statement . All patients signed a statement of informed consent agreeing to participate in the study . Sample size and pilot study The sample size was estimated using the a computational program . Thirty patients were submitted to third molar surgeries in a pilot study to determine the sample size . This step was necessary due to the lack of similar studies in the literature . Calculations were performed with specific programs taking into consideration the variables , a 95 % confidence interval , 80 % test power and 5 % error . At the end of the study , 120 patients were analyzed ( 40 in each group ) , totaling 240 surgeries . Sample selection One hundred twenty eight individuals between 18 and 40 years of age were selected for participation in the present study and submission to maxillary and mandibular third molar extractions bilaterally at the Department of Oral-Maxillofacial Surgery . Each patient was to be submitted to two surgeries . The third molars ( maxillary or mandibular ) needed to have the same degree of impaction on both sides . Three groups were formed : Group A received diazepam and placebo , Group B received midazolam and placebo and Group C received midazolam and diazepam . For the purposes of randomization and blinding of the surgeon and researcher in charge of analyzing the results , the groups were renominated Groups 1 , 2 and 3 . The randomization procedure was carried out by a researcher who was not directly involved in the surgeries or evaluations . Sequentially numbered , sealed , opaque envelopes were used , each containing a combination of substances and the side to be submitted to the first surgery . For each patient , the researcher opened an envelope , informed the main investigator and surgeon of the side to be operated , and administered the substance to the patient . The second surgery was performed on the contralateral side with the administration of the second substance . Blinding was performed to avoid awareness regarding what substance was administered in each surgery . For such , the pills were fabricated with the same outer color and a standardized size at the Pernambuco Pharmaceutical Laboratory ( Brazil ) and were packaged in recipients with the same color . The recipients were denominated 1 , 2 and 3 . Surgical procedures and medications As the patients were classified as healthy , no prophylactic use of antibiotics was performed prior to surgery for the prevention of bacterial endocarditis , as recommended by the American Heart Association . All patients rinsed their mouths with 0.12 % chlorhexidine for one minute prior to surgery to reduce the bacterial population in the oral cavity . Moreover , all patients were instructed to take two 4-mg pills of dexamethasone one hour prior to surgery . The use of a corticosteroid in the preoperative period minimizes the occurrence of postoperative swelling and reduces the risk of trismus.13 The substances ( diazepam , midazolam and placebo ) were administered orally 45 minutes prior to the surgical procedure .

University of Michigan,NCT02178696,Predictors of Antidepressant Response,University of Michigan,4,1,Depression,Other,"Placebo, identified as placebo to participants",Other,Single,"Major depression is a highly prevalent , frequently debilitating illness that too often fails to respond to currently available treatments such as antidepressant medication . Furthermore , randomized controlled trials of antidepressants consistently demonstrate large placebo effects .

This study will test this hypothesis by recruiting treatment-seeking volunteers with major depression , with or without comorbid nicotine dependence . Volunteers will participate in positron emission tomography ( PET ) and functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) scans in the context of a treatment trial in which they will receive both placebo and antidepressant medication .

Wuhan General Hospital of Guangzhou Military Command,NCT02170324,GLP-1 Agonism Stimulates Browning of Subcutaneous White Adipose Tissue in Obesity Men,Xiang Guang-da,4,1,Obesity,Drug,Exenatide,Treatment,,"Adipose tissues , which include white adipose tissue ( WAT ) and brown adipose tissue ( BAT ) , play an essential role in regulating whole-body energy homeostasis . Excess expansion of WAT due to positive energy balance and defects in thermogenic gene expression in BAT are associated with obesity and various metabolic diseases . Until 2009 the question of whether adult humans had BAT and whether it could conceivably contribute to whole body energy usage in a meaningful way was a matter of vigorous debate . The publication of three apppers in the New England Journal of Medicine that demonstrated adult humans do have BAT , that it can be activated , and that this activation appears to be defective in obesity reframed the debate , and revived interest in BAT physiology . Recent studies also reveal the presence of a subset of cells in WAT that could be induced by environmental or hormonal factors to become `` brown-like '' cells , and this `` beigeing '' process has been suggested to have strong antiobesity and antidiabetic benefits . The extrapancreatic actions of glucagon-like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) on endothelial cells and the liver have been reported . Additionally , effects of GLP-1 on adipose tissue have been described . Studies performed in isolated adipocytes have demonstrated that GLP-1 has the ability to induce both lipogenic and lipolytic mechanisms in white adipose tissue ( WAT ) . More recent study showed that GLP-1 agonism stimulates brown adipose tissue thermogenesis and browning through hypothalamic AMP-activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) in animal . However , there is no data clearly show that GLP-1 agonism stimulates browning of subcutaneous white adipose tissue ( SWAT ) in human obesity .","Individuals were treated for 10 days . Biopsy for subcutaneous white adipose ( 1.5X1.5X1.5cm ) was performed before and after 10 days treatment programme under local anesthesia .

Fr Muller Homoeopathic Medical College,NCT02175498,Effectiveness of Homeopathic Treatment in Female Infertility,Fr Muller Homoeopathic Medical College,3,1,Female Infertility,Drug,Homoeopathic medicines,Treatment,,The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of Homoeopathic treatment in female infertility .,"Objectives : • To assess the rate of conception , in female infertility , after individualized homoeopathic treatment . Need for the study : To confirm that homeopathy is best alternative for resource limited community to receive effective treatment with minimum possible expenditure . To bring out a repertoire of effective Homoeopathic medicines in the treatment of infertility . To establish a centre for focussed treatment of infertility at Father Muller Homeopathic Medical College and Hospital . Many cases visiting Homoeopathic OPD have improved under the treatment . In general , there is a deficit of well-designed , randomized , controlled trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of complementary and alternative medicine for these indications , which makes it difficult to provide evidence-based recommendations . Globally there is a need for this study to avoid the side-effects of antibiotics and hormonal tablets thus improving the quality of life . In a third world country like India where infertile females can not afford surgery ; Homoeopathic medicines are simple , safe and cost effective . Homoeopathy can treat the underlying cause of female infertility in these cases and thereby prevent the hazards of surgery . In India the female race is always targeted and blamed for being infertile . This not only has an impact on the health of the woman but also affects her social status . The psychological and mental agony suffered by these infertile women and the fear that their husbands ' may go in for a second marriage in turn causes great stress and anxiety . Hence the efficacy of Homoeopathic medicines on infertile females needs to be explored . Methodology : Approach : This is a prospective study with purposive sampling . Design : Total number of beneficiaries is 40 , including 20 PCOS cases , 10 cases of Endometriosis , and 10 cases of Chronic Pelvic Inflammatory diseases . The numbers of these cases are based on the availability and frequency of their visits to our OPD . Data collection instruments : case books of the OPD Setting : OPD of Homeopathic Medical College , Derlakatte , Kankanady and Thumbe Population : women visiting the OPD for infertility treatment Sample : women diagnosed for any of the three causes of infertility Sampling technique : purposive sampling Feasibility : the study is feasible in terms of availability of patients at our OPD settings Duration of study : total of 3 years . All 40 cases are expected to be registered in a span of 6 months to 1 year . Registration will be followed by treatment of 18 months , 6 months for analysis and reporting by the end of 3 years . Statistical analysis : Data from the sample is collected and subjected to chi square test , and frequencies will be calculated . Null Hypothesis : No significant difference in cases of female infertility before and after treatment . Alternate Hypothesis : Significant difference in cases of female infertility before and after treatment . Procedure : Forty infertile women will undergo investigations like Ultrasonography of pelvis , diagnostic laparoscopy when needed and urine pregnancy test once in six months . The cases will be diagnosed by the principal investigators and co-investigators . Semen analysis in male partners will be done as a routine to rule out cases of male infertility . The infertile women will be administered appropriate Homoeopathic Simillimum by the principal investigator for 18 months . The follow-up visits of these patients will be once in two weeks . Effectiveness of Homoeopathic treatment and rate of conception in infertile females will be assessed after administering the Simillimum . The investigations will be repeated after treatment and cases will be reviewed and examined by the co-investigators . The treatment given is individually chosen homoeopathic medicine based on the psychophysical symptom syndrome each experienced . The drugs are procured from Fr Muller HPD which complies with the standards of Homoeopathic Pharmacopoeia . The investigations will be repeated after treatment . The Homoeopathic treatment includes a detailed interview in which the patient is queried about her unique symptoms . The well indicated constitutional remedy will be given on the basis of symptoms ' similarity , that is , symptoms that were in emotional and mental realm and those that affected her entire body . The symptoms will be ordered by intensity and prominence . A single dose of Homoeopathic Similimum will be given to each of these patients and repeated as and when needed and whenever required the potency will be increased . If there is any miasmatic block , anti-miasmatic treatment will be given . Acute remedy will be given when needed . All cases of infertility are told to abstain from caffeine and Allopathic treatment . Hormonal treatment is to be withdrawn .

Randomized placebo-controlled studies have shown that BTX administered by intramural injection into the bladder wall in patients with OAB leads to significant improvement in urodynamic parameters and quality of life . ( Schurch 2008 ) . On the other hand , the animal study suggests that intravesically applied BTX acts to decrease frequency of bladder contraction by inhibiting sensory mechanism in the urothelium rather than directly through inhibition of the smooth muscle contraction . ( Khera 2005 ) . The efficacy of intravesical BTX instillation was only tested in a few open label trials for overactive bladder patients whereby the clinical improvement observed was short-lasting with a mean duration of 6.8 weeks ( Petrou 2009 , Krhut 2011 ) . The short exposure duration of the urothelium to BTX could be one of the factors responsible for the lack of a sustained effect . TC-3 is a hydrogel with reverse thermal gelation properties that when mixed with BTX and instilled intravesically serves as the drug reservoir allowing for gradual release of BTX and thereby for its extended contact with bladder urothelium .",2014-06-29,"February 28, 2016","Inclusion Criteria : Female 18 to 85 years old with symptoms of idiopathic OAB for ≥ 3 months prior to screening .

University of Pittsburgh,NCT02178189,RCT of High- vs. Standard-Calorie Formula for Methadone-Exposed Infants,University of Pittsburgh,2,1,Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome,Other,High Calorie Infant formula,Treatment,Triple,"Neonatal abstinence syndrome ( NAS ) symptoms contribute to poor infant weight gain . Early caloric enhancement for infants exposed to methadone is inexpensive , readily available , easy to implement and could improve early outcomes for these high-risk infants . We will conduct a preliminary randomized clinical trial of high-calorie vs. standard-calorie formula for methadone exposed infants to evaluate the adequacy of recruitment , protocol feasibility and estimates of whether high-calorie formula results in more normal patterns of weight loss and gain , less severe NAS symptoms and shorter hospital stays .","Background : Infants exposed to methadone during pregnancy experience high rates of neonatal abstinence syndrome ( NAS ) . Common NAS symptoms ( tremulousness , increased muscle tone , sweating , excessive crying , vomiting and diarrhea ) increase infants ' metabolic needs . Another frequent NAS symptom , weak and uncoordinated suckling , impairs infants ' ability to take in adequate calories . These combined problems compromise infant weight gain . The current standard of care for opiate-exposed infants requires evidence of poor weight gain or excessive weight loss before initiating high-calorie formula . We hypothesize that inadequate caloric intake among methadone exposed infants may result in excessive weight loss , slow weight regain and exacerbation of NAS . These factors lead to the newborn 's requirement for higher morphine doses and longer duration of hospitalization . Therefore , methadone exposed infants may benefit from early caloric enhancement . A nutritional intervention for opiate-exposed infants has not been previously evaluated . This application will provide data on adequacy of recruitment , protocol feasibility , performance of selected measures , and preliminary estimates of efficacy for a comprehensive R01 submission . Specific Aims : For methadone exposed infants , compare infants randomized to high ( 24 kcal/oz ) versus standard ( 20 kcal/oz ) formula for the following outcomes : Weight loss and gain patterns . The primary dependent measure will be days until the infant returns to birth weight . Secondary measures will be maximum percent weight loss and days to weight nadir . NAS severity measured by : a ) total length of hospital stay for NAS ; b ) duration of NAS treatment ; c ) mean Finnegan scores on days 2-10 ; d ) maximum concentration of morphine used to treat NAS . Describe the suck quality at 4-6 days of age among methadone exposed infants . Evaluate the association between the infant suck quality and infant weight loss and gain patterns and measures of NAS severity . Design : Women on methadone will be recruited during pregnancy and will attend a single brief visit late in pregnancy . After delivery , infants will be randomized in a double blind trial of either high-calorie or standard-calorie formula which will be started at 72 hours after birth and be continued through 21 days of age . Infants will be weighed daily and will have outpatient study visits at 1 and 3 months . For this pilot study , up to 70 mothers will be enrolled over 18 months . This pilot study is needed to establish the feasibility of the study methods and to better estimate differences that can be observed between the groups . For the primary outcome variable , days until the infant returns to birth weight , discrete survival methods will be used . Potential Impact : Early caloric enhancement for methadone-exposed infants is inexpensive , readily available , easy to implement and could improve outcomes of these high-risk infants . High-calorie formula could result in a more normal pattern of weight loss and gain , less severe NAS symptoms and shorter hospital stays .",2014-06-26,"June 26, 2014","Inclusion Criteria : Infants born to pregnant women , who are 18 to 45 years of age , participating in a licensed methadone maintenance treatment program planning to delivered at Magee if consented during pregnancy or delivered at Magee within the past 48 hours Exclusion Criteria : Infants born weighing < 2200 grams or before 35 weeks Multiple gestation pregnancies ( eg . twins ) Infants with major congenital malformations that could interfere with feeding or weight gain , such as Downs syndrome , cleft lip or palate , congenital heart disease or cystic fibrosis will be excluded .

This research has the potential to increase use of highly effective contraception in a high-risk population and lower the persistently elevated rate of U.S. unintended pregnancy .","Unintended pregnancy has multiple adverse effects on both maternal and child health . The United States continues to have one of the highest rates of unintended pregnancy among developed countries . To combat this problem , we are studying initiation of the highly effective intrauterine device ( IUD ) for women presenting for emergency contraception ( EC ) . This is an ideal population to initiate highly effective reversible contraception ( HERC ) as they are at high risk of unintended pregnancy and are acting to reduce that risk . We have recently demonstrated significantly lower pregnancy rates 12 months after presenting for EC among women who selected the copper IUD versus those who selected oral Levonorgestrel ( LNG ) . Not only is the copper IUD the most effective method of EC , it is considered a top tier anticipatory contraception method and its ability to prevent pregnancy is on par with tubal sterilization ( less than 1 % in the first year with lower failure rates in subsequent years ) . However , women selecting intrauterine contraception have shown a strong preference for the LNG IUD . The LNG IUD , is as effective at preventing pregnancy as the Copper IUD , and has some non-contraceptive effects that many women see as benefits such as the reduction or elimination of menstrual bleeding and menstrual related discomfort . Of currently available reversible contraceptives , the LNG IUD has the highest levels of user satisfaction and continuation . However , its effectiveness as an emergency contraceptive remains unknown . A randomized control trial is necessary to assess the safety and efficacy of the LNG IUD as EC . Demonstrating the efficacy , safety , and acceptability of the LNG IUD for EC will improve options for women seeking EC and who desire a highly effective method of contraception .",2014-06-23,"June 27, 2022",Inclusion Criteria : Females between 18-35 years old In need of EC ( had unprotected intercourse within 120 hours - 5 days ) Desire to prevent pregnancy for 1 year Fluent in English and/or Spanish Have a regular menstrual cycle ( 21-35 days ) Know their last menstrual period ( +/-3 days ) Be willing to comply with the study requirements Desire to initiate an IUD Negative urine pregnancy test Exclusion Criteria : Current pregnancy Breastfeeding Intrauterine infection within the past three months Sterilization Already have an IUD or contraception implant ( Nexplanon ) in place Vaginal bleeding of unknown etiology Known Gonorrhea or Chlamydia infection in the last 30 days ( unless successfully treated at least 7 days prior to study entry ) Known abnormalities of the uterus that distort the uterine cavity Allergy to copper Use of oral Emergency Contraception in the preceeding 5 days,711,1,18 Years,35 Years

National Institutes of Health Clinical Center (CC),NCT02037295,Investigation of the Gut Microbiota in Regulating Nutrient Absorption in Humans,National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK),2,1,Obesity,Drug,Vancomycin,Prevention,Triple,"We propose to study both stool and urine energy loss in 24 individuals on two experimental diets ( 50 % increased and 50 % reduced nutrient load relative to body size ) in a random cross-over design . Following this over/underfeeding , volunteers will also be randomly assigned to a placebo versus oral antibiotic medication arm . This study will extend our previous findings by investigating whether 1 ) nutrient absorption changes upon similar increases/decreases in relative nutrient load and 2 ) whether manipulation of gut microbial communities with antibiotics alters nutrient absorption and 3 ) how these changes may affect glucose tolerance and fat storage .","The prevalence of obesity has risen to epidemic proportions in the world , resulting from both excessive energy intake and low levels of energy expenditure . The effect of nutrient absorption on energy balance , that is , the relative amount of nutrients consumed vs. the amount excreted in stool , has been reported only in small studies in which energy waste in feces and urine between lean and obese individuals was not found to be different . New studies have shown that bacteria in the gut may play an important role in calorie absorption . We have recently shown that leaner individuals absorbed more calories when overfed compared to when they were given a diet with just enough calories to maintain their own weight . Our studies have also found that overfeeding also changes the kinds of bacteria found in the gut . In lean individuals , these changes in gut bacterial communities with overfeeding were associated with changes in how many calories were absorbed . Our results are similar to those seen in other studies in animals and humans that suggest a role for gut bacteria in weight gain and obesity . To try to better understand the role of gut bacteria in absorbing food , we propose to investigate 1 ) whether energy loss ( as measured in stool and urine ) changes following over- and underfeeding relative to body size and 2 ) whether changes in the gut bacteria , induced by an antibiotic medication , affect nutrient absorption and glucose tolerance . We plan to study 24 healthy non-smoking volunteers age 18 45 years old , not taking any medications ( including medications for weight loss , antibiotics or probiotics ) for the examination . All participants will be admitted to the Clinical Research Unit for 31 days . During their stay , subjects will be fed a weight maintaining diet for 3 days , followed by two experimental diets ( 150 % and 50 % of weight maintaining calories ) in a random order . After this , volunteers will be randomly assigned to one of two groups : group 1 will take oral antibiotic medication ; group 2 will receive pills that look the same but will not contain any active medication ( placebos ) . Feces ( stool ) will be collected throughout the study . Additionally , twenty four-hour urine collections will take place each day of the experimental diet period and when stool is collected on the antibiotics . The energy content of these waste products as well as that of the diet ( using duplicate plate analysis ) will be measured by bomb calorimetry . Bacterial components in feces will be extracted by repeated fractional centrifugation to obtain bacterial mass and by using 16S rDNA-based oligonucleotide probes to obtain data on gut bacteria . Primary results will examine how many calories remain in stool during relative over- and underfeeding and whether changes in gut bacteria , induced by an antibiotic medication , affect nutrient absorption and glucose tolerance .",2014-01-14,"July 9, 2020","INCLUSION CRITERIA : Free of acute and chronic diseases ( especially GI disorders ) as determined by medical history , physical examination and laboratory tests . Individuals may be taking laxative drugs but they must be discontinued 3 or more weeks before admission . Age 18-45 y ( in order to minimize the affect of aging on nutrient absorption ) .

However , this pain needs to be treated adequately to allow early mobilization . Ultrasound guided transversus abdominis plane ( TAP ) block is an established technique to manage post laparoscopic cholecystectomy pain . 1 In addition , the use of TAP blocks reduced the need for intraoperative and postoperative opioids and the side-effects associated with their use . The aim of a TAP block is to deposit local anaesthetic in the plane between the internal oblique and transversus abdominis muscles targeting the spinal nerves in this plane . The innervation to abdominal skin , muscles and parietal peritoneum will be interrupted . Dexmedetomidine which is an Alpha 2-adrenergic agonist produces analgesia via a non-opioid mechanism and is also known to enhance central and peripheral neural blockades.2 Dexmedetomidine added to bupivacaine or levobupivacaine for brachial plexus block shortens sensory and motor block onset time , extends motor and sensory block durations , and also extends the postoperative analgesia.3 , 4 We postulate that the use of dexmedetomidine as an adjunct to bupivacaine in transversus abdominis plane block will reduce the morphine consumption after laparoscopic cholecystectomy . Based upon previous published data,4 a priori power analysis indicated that 60 patients in each group would be sufficient to detect a 30 % reduction in the 24-hours cumulative morphine consumption , which is considered to be of clinical validity , with a type-I error of 0.0167 ( 0.05/4 ) and a power of 80 % . We added 10 % extra patients to compensate for possible dropouts . All patients will be familiarized with a 10-cm visual analogue scale ( VAS ) ( 0= no pain ; 10= worst imaginable ) to assess the intensity of pain and on the use of the patient-controlled analgesia ( PCA ) . Monitoring includes non-invasive blood pressure , and electrocardiography , pulse oximetry . An intravenous infusion of 10 ml kg-1 of Lactated Ringer 's solution will be initiated before surgery and will be followed by 5 ml kg-1 hr-1 throughout the procedure . Anaesthesia technique will be standardized . Anesthesia will be induced by fentanyl of 2-3 µg kg-1 , propofol 1.5-2.5 mg kg-1 , and rocuronium 0.6 mg kg-1 . Tracheal intubation will be carried out at the development of maximum block as monitored by the train-of-four ( TOF ) . Anesthesia , consisting of a 0.7-1.5 minimum alveolar concentration ( MAC ) of sevoflurane , will be administered to maintain heart rate ( HR ) and mean arterial blood pressure ( MAP ) values below 20 % of baseline values . Fentanyl 0.5μg/kg increments will be administered when the HR and MAP values are > 20 % of baseline values , despite a target sevoflurane of MAC ≥ 1.5 . When the HR and MAP values < 20 % of baseline values , the sevoflurane MAC is decreased gradually to 0.7 MAC . Patients ' lungs will be ventilated to achieve a PaCO2 of 35-45 mm Hg . All patients will receive intravenous granisetron 1 mg and lornoxicam 16 mg after the induction of anaesthesia . Rocuronium increments will be given to maintain suppression of the second twitch in the TOF . The anaesthesiologists who will perform the TAP block and give the anaesthetics will not be involved in the patients ' assessment . All other staff in the operating room is unaware of the randomization code . The TAP block will be performed using ultrasound ( SonoSite M-Turbo® , Sonosite , USA ) guidance as described by Ra et al All operations will be performed by the same surgeons . CO2 pneumoperitoneum will be introduced and intra-abdominal insufflation pressure will be limited to 12 mm Hg . After introducing of the four trocars , the patient will be placed in the reverse Trendelenburg position , using up to 30° of head-up tilt . No supplementary dose of muscle relaxant was administered 30 minutes before the end of the surgery . After desufflation of CO2 pneumoperitoneum , the patient will be returned to the horizontal position and during skin closure ; neuromuscular blockade will be antagonized with 50 µg kg-1 neostigmine and 10 µg kg-1 glycopyrrolate . At the last skin suture , desflurane will be discontinued and tracheal extubation will be performed at the discretion of the involved anesthetist in the patient 's management . A standard postoperative analgesic regimen , consisting of 12-hourly intravenous lornoxicam 8 mg , 6-hourly intravenous paracetamol 1 g and intravenous morphine PCA ( incremental dose , 1 mg ; lockout time , 6-min ; a maximum 4-hourly limit , 30 mg ) , will be used in all patients .

Inoperable gastric cancer usually has a large ulcer with friable tumor vessels . Acidic environment in stomach prevents adequate function of coagulation cascade and decrease clot stability . Gastric cancer bleeding may cause significant morbidity and often delays scheduled chemotherapy . National Center Center data showed that about 30 % of gastric cancer patient undergoing palliative chemotherapy eventually experience significant cancer bleeding during the treatment period . Once bleeding occurs , endoscopic management is more difficult in gastric cancer patients than in patients with benign peptic ulcers , because the malignant ulcer bed has significant fibrosis . Consequently , gastric cancer patient has a high risk of rebleeding . Proton pump inhibitor ( PPI , lansoprazole for example ) decrease gastric acid secretion by inhibiting H+ , K+-ATPase , and subsequently stabilize blood clot . PPIs are commonly used for benign peptic ulcer or reflux esophagitis , and PPI can decrease recurrent benign ulcer bleeding or other ulcer complications . Moreover , it was reported to prevent bleeding from NSAID or aspirin induced gastric ulcer . Because PPIs are very safe , and they are even available as over-the-counter drugs in some countries . Furthermore , the drug has no interaction with major chemotherapeutic agents commonly used for gastric cancer . Moreover , the drugs are prescribed to the gastric cancer patients when tumor bleeding occurs .

This type of therapy is called gene transfer . In this protocol , we are modifying the patients white blood cells with a retrovirus that has the gene for anti-MAGE-A3 incorporated in the retrovirus . Objective : The purpose of this study is to determine a safe number of these cells to infuse and to see if these particular tumor-fighting cells ( anti-MAGE A3 cells ) cause tumors to shrink and to be certain the treatment is safe Eligibility : - Adults age 18-66 with cancer expressing the MAGE-A3 molecule . Design : Work up stage : Patients will be seen as an outpatient at the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) clinical Center and undergo a history and physical examination , scans , x-rays , lab tests , and other tests as needed Leukapheresis : If the patients meet all of the requirements for the study they will undergo leukapheresis to obtain white blood cells to make the anti MAGE-A3 cells . { Leukapheresis is a common procedure , which removes only the white blood cells from the patient . } Treatment : Once their cells have grown , the patients will be admitted to the hospital for the conditioning chemotherapy , the anti MAGE-A3 cells and aldesleukin . They will stay in the hospital for about 4 weeks for the treatment . Follow up : Patients will return to the clinic for a physical exam , review of side effects , lab tests , and scans about every 1-3 months for the first year , and then every 6 months to 1 year as long as their tumors are shrinking . Follow up visits take up to 2 days .","Background : We have constructed a single retroviral vector that contains both alpha and beta chains of a T cell receptor ( TCR ) that recognizes the human leukocyte antigen serotype within HLA-A `` A '' serotype group ( HLA-A 01 ) restricted MAGE-A3 tumor antigen , which can be used to mediate genetic transfer of this TCR with high efficiency . In co-cultures with human leukocyte antigen serotype within HLA-A A serotype group ( HLA-A 01 ) and MAGE-A3 double positive tumors , the anti-MAGE-A3- A 01 restricted ( anti-MAGE-A3-01 ) TCR transduced T cells secreted significant amounts of Interferon ( IFN ) - > = with high specificity . Objectives : Primary objectives : Determine a safe dose of administration of autologous T cells transduced with an anti- MAGE-A3 HLA-A 01-restricted TCR ( MAGE-A3-01 ) TCR and aldesleukin to patients following a nonmyeloablative but lymphoid depleting preparative regimen . Determine if this approach will result in objective tumor regression in patients with metastatic cancer expressing MAGE-A3 . Determine the toxicity profile of this treatment regimen . Eligibility : Patients who are HLA-A 01 positive and 18 years of age or older must have Metastatic cancer whose tumors express the MAGE-A3 antigen Previously received and have been a non-responder to or recurred following at least one first line treatment for metastatic disease Patients may not have : - Contraindications for high dose aldesleukin administration . Design : Peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) obtained by leukapheresis will be transduced with the retroviral vector supernatant encoding the anti-MAGE-A3 HLA-A 01-restricted TCR . The study will begin with a phase I dose escalation . After the maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) cell dose has been determined , patients will be enrolled into the phase II portion of the trial at the MTD established during the phase I portion of the study . In the phase II portion , patients will be entered into two cohorts : cohort 2a will include patients with metastatic melanoma ; cohort 2b will include patients with renal cancer and other types of metastatic cancer . Patients will receive a nonmyeloablative but lymphocyte depleting preparative regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine followed by intravenous infusion of ex vivo tumor reactive , TCR gene-transduced PBMC plus intravenous ( IV ) aldesleukin . Patients will undergo complete evaluation of tumor response every 1-6 months until off study criteria are met . For each of the two strata evaluated in the phase 2 portion , the study will be conducted using a phase II optimal design where initially 21 evaluable patients will be enrolled . For each of these two arms of the trial , if 0 or 1 of the 21 patients experiences a clinical response , then no further patients will be enrolled but if 2 or more of the first 21 evaluable patients enrolled have a clinical response , then accrual will continue until a total of 41 evaluable patients have been enrolled in that stratum . For both strata , the objective will be to determine if the treatment regimen is able to be associated with a clinical response rate that can rule out 5 % ( p0=0.05 ) in favor of a modes 20 % partial response ( PR ) + complete response ( CR ) rate ( p1=0.20 ) . In order to complete the dose escalation phase and both phase II cohorts , a total of up to 20+82=102 patients may be required ( 20 + 2 strata with a maximum of 41 apiece ) . Up to 6 patients enrolled at the MTD will count towards the accrual in the appropriate phase II strata if they are evaluable for response and if they would be fully eligible for enrollment in the phase II portion of the trial .

This procedure causes considerable pain and distress , especially in young children ( Humphrey , Boon , van Linden van den Heuvell , & van de Wiel , 1992 ) . Children rate needles as being the most distressing aspect of hospitalization ( Kortesluoma & Nikkonen , 2006 ; Kortesluoma & Nikkonen , 2004 ) , yet they are the most frequently performed skin-breaking procedure for hospitalized children ( Cummings , Reid , Finley , McGrath , & Ritchie , 1996 ; Ellis , et al. , 2004 ; Rennick , McHarg , Dell'Api , Johnston , & Stevens , 2008 ; Stevens et al. , 2011 ) . It is estimated that one-quarter of adults have developed a fear needles , most likely developed during childhood ( Taddio et al. , 2010 ; Wright , Yelland , Heathcote , Ng , & Wright , 2009 ) . Being afraid of needles increases the risk of avoidance of needles for immunizations and medical care ( Taddio et al. , 2009 ; Wright , et al. , 2009 ) . It is therefore crucial that health care researchers and clinicians determine effective pain management strategies for young children , and consistently use such strategies in clinical care . Rationale : There is a paucity of evidence to support efficacy and feasibility of pain management strategies during needle-related painful procedures in young children , and uncertainties exist regarding analgesic effects of sweet solutions beyond infancy . Objectives : The primary objective of this study is to ascertain whether there is evidence of efficacy of oral 24 % sucrose ( TootSweet , Natural Product Number ( NPN ) 80021492 ; DandleLion Kisses , NPN 80075819 ) in toddlers ( ages 12 to 36 months ) compared to placebo ( water ) during venipuncture , as measured by pain scores and cry duration . Methods : A single-centre , phase IV , blinded , two-armed randomized controlled trial ( RCT ) . Study population : Children aged 12 to 36 months , who are patients in the surgical/medical wards of an urban pediatric tertiary care centre who require venipuncture for the purpose of medically-required venous blood sampling .

Buprenorphine/naloxone will be dispensed weekly during the 30-day stabilization and twice weekly during taper phase , and all patients who successfully complete the detoxification will be offered induction onto XR-NTX . All participants will receive weekly therapy with a study psychiatrist . All participants will receive open-label medication . The primary outcome of this study will be percentage of patients successfully inducted onto XR-NTX . Secondary outcomes will be time to relapse , defined as opioid use or dropout .","Buprenorphine induction/stabilization/taper : Buprenorphine induction will be conducted at our STARS clinic and according to current clinical guidelines . Participants who have initially failed outpatient induction onto XR-NTX will receive buprenorphine/naloxone ( BUP ) on a weekly basis that they will take daily , according to the following schedule : 8/2 mg ( Days 1-10 ) , 6/1.5 mg ( Days 11-15 ) , 4/1 mg ( Days 16-20 ) , 3.0/0.75 mg ( Days 21-25 ) , 2.0/0.5 mg ( Days 26-30 ) . Participants will attend the clinic twice weekly and will be assessed for opioid and other substance use ( urine toxicology and self-report ) , vital signs , opioid withdrawal symptoms , opioid cravings , and dose adjustments of buprenorphine will be made as needed by study physicians . If a dose reduction is needed , the stabilization and taper schedule will be adjusted to occur over 30 days . Participants will be stabilized on , and tapered off , buprenorphine over a 4-week period.Reductions will occur in a graded fashion , with the stabilization dose reduced to 2 mg . This approach to buprenorphine taper is intended to resemble standard clinical practice , in which patients seeking transition off buprenorphine undergo a slow taper . A gradual taper over approximately 4 weeks has established precedent ( Sigmon et al . 2013 , Ling et al . 2009 , Nielsen et al . 2013 ) as a well-tolerated taper strategy for transitioning off buprenorphine . The purpose is in part to provide a slow transition with minimal withdrawal symptoms . Participants will have at least two study visits a week during the buprenorphine taper , but may be seen more regularly at STARS if deemed clinically necessary . Naltrexone induction procedure : Participants who successfully complete the taper must then complete a two-day washout ( abstinence for opioids , buprenorphine ) . During this 48-hr period , participants will report to the STARS clinic daily for vital sign monitoring and to receive ancillary medications ( clonidine , clonazepam , zolpidem , prochlorperazine ) to alleviate withdrawal and discomfort as needed . After abstinence of > /=48 hours from the last buprenorphine dose , to allow for mu receptor availability , participants will begin the naltrexone induction , using a 4-day ascending taper of oral naltrexone ( 1 , 3 , 12 , and 25 mg ) , followed by injection naltrexone . The administration of naltrexone will occur within a detoxification suite provided at STARS , consisting of a private room outfitted with two comfortable reclining lounge chairs for resting , adjustable lighting , and an entertainment system . Participants will be monitored by clinical staff at least every 1-2 hours with frequent vital signs checks and withdrawal assessments . A research psychiatrist or study physician will be present at all times to conduct frequent clinical assessments and provide adjuvant medications and naltrexone . Patients will be monitored on a daily basis ( Monday to Friday ) for up to 8 hours per day . Transportation home by car service will be provided at the end of the day for any patient deemed to have this clinical need . On Day 1 of the naltrexone induction , participants are pre-treated with prochlorperazine 10 mg for nausea , followed be the first dose of naltrexone 1mg . Ascending doses of naltrexone will then be titrated upward slowly ( 3mg , 12mg , 25mg ) . Adjuvant medications will be available to patients and will include clonidine for myalgias , prochlorperazine for nausea , clonazepam to reduce anxiety and dysphoria , and trazodone or zolpidem for insomnia . Participants will be provided take-home doses of adjuvant medications in small doses and on a tapering schedule for one week post-administration of XR-NTX . Participants will be required to visit the clinic daily and remain there for at least 1 hour to permit close monitoring , with an option to stay as long as necessary to achieve relief of symptoms and medical stability prior to being discharged home . Once 25 mg of naltrexone has been tolerated , the participant may receive 380 mg IM XR-NTX . Additionally , for female participants , a urine pregnancy test will be obtained on the day of XR-NTX administration . Prior to administration of XR-NTX , participants who have been non-compliant with the oral naltrexone schedule , accompanied by lapses to opioid use , or in any case for which the challenge appears clinically indicated in the judgment of the study physician or research team , will receive a naloxone challenge prior to XR-NTX administration . Referrals to local treatment providers will be arranged for participants who successfully complete the study and request to continue XR-NTX maintenance XR-NTX injections : XR-NTX will be administered once naltrexone 25 mg has been tolerated , as an intramuscular injection ( 380 mg ) in one buttock by one of the research psychiatrists or research nurses of STARS , who are currently trained and administer XR-NTX in other protocols . Participants will be observed for at least 2 hours after the first injection . Participants will be offered a second injection at Week 5 ( four weeks post-administration of the first injection ) , and a third injection at Week 9 . Prior to receiving second and third injections at STARS , patients will either provide an opioid-negative urine or pass a naloxone challenge test . At each STARS visit the patient meets with the research assistant to complete research ratings , including self-report of withdrawal , mood , and drug use . Blood samples are drawn according to the protocol for naltrexone serum levels and liver enzymes . The patient provides a urine sample under observation by a staff member at each visit . STARS is staffed by both male and female research assistants so that all urines can be appropriately monitored . All participants will receive a weekly medication adherence-focused psychosocial intervention informed by relapse prevention strategies we previously developed in Behavioral Naltrexone Therapy and delivered by the study physician ( Rothenberg , Sullivan et al . 2002 ) .

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,NCT02291263,Immunogenicity of Intramuscular Inactivated Poliovirus Vaccine,Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,3,1,Poliomyelitis,Biological,bOPV/IPV (6 weeks),Prevention,,"This study will be an open-label phase III randomized clinical trial comparing different combinations and regimens of polio vaccines . The trial will compare one and two doses of IPV administered at 6 weeks or 14 weeks or 6 and 14 weeks of age . All participants will also receive bOPV at 6 , 10 and 14 weeks of age .","Oral poliovirus vaccines are live attenuated viral vaccines and the vaccine virus in OPV can mutate and acquire neurovirulence causing paralysis either due to vaccine-associated paralytic polio ( VAPP ) or due to circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses ( cVDPVs ) , in which the attenuated vaccine virus not only acquires the ability to cause paralysis but can also circulate similar to wild poliovirus ( WPV ) . The potential of vaccine virus to acquire neurovirulence and cause paralytic poliomyelitis is incompatible with eradication of polio . Therefore , polio eradication will require eventual cessation of all OPVs . The last case of WPV2 was reported in 1999 in India . Type 2 vaccine virus in tOPV is most likely to cause cVDPVs and over 80 % of cVDPVs over the past decade have been cVDPV2 . Of the estimated 250-500 annual VAPP cases almost 40 % are due to type 2 . Thus , with the eradication of WPV2 it is imperative to prioritize removal of type 2 containing OPV . The licensing and availability of bivalent OPV ( bOPV ) containing type 1 and 3 offers the option of an OPV that does not contain OPV2 . In April 2013 , the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization ( SAGE ) recommended phased cessation of OPV types starting with the switch from trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine ( tOPV ) to bivalent OPV ( bOPV ) . In November 2013 , SAGE recommended that countries that introduce at least one dose of IPV in the routine immunization program should administer the first dose of IPV at ≥14 weeks of age . In countries with routine immunization schedule of 6 , 10 and 14 weeks of age or 2 , 3 and 4 months of age , IPV would then be added to the DTP3 visit for children on schedule or administered at the first immunization visit at 14 weeks or later if children are off schedule . For countries with 2 , 4 and 6 month schedule , IPV could be added either to DTP2 or DTP3 visit . SAGE also proposed that countries have the flexibility to consider alternative schedules including administering IPV earlier than 14 weeks of age or administer more than one dose of IPV . The principal objective of pre-eradication introduction of IPV is to mitigate the risk associated with an increased susceptibility to type 2 polioviruses when bOPV is introduced . Therefore , the objective is to achieve the highest possible type 2 population immunity with IPV , which is a product of the per dose immunogenicity of IPV and the coverage achieved by IPV at that vaccination visit in routine immunization . At present , no study has assessed immunological response against type 2 poliovirus of a single dose of IPV at 14 weeks of age , the SAGE recommended target age for IPV introduction . Furthermore , there is need to determine the immunological response with other potential alternatives for IPV introduction in routine immunization within the context of EPI schedule including immunological response with more than one dose of IPV . Also there is urgent need to document the immunogenicity of bOPV at 6 , 10 and 14 weeks of age with IPV against type 1 and 3 polioviruses . In this trial , the investigators are trying to determine the immunogenicity of alternative schedules of administering IPV other than the SAGE recommended schedule of IPV at 14 weeks of age . How does the immunogenicity of multiple doses of IPV at 6 and 14 weeks of age compare to only one dose at 14 weeks of age ? How does IPV immunogenicity at 6 weeks of age compare to IPV at 14 weeks of age ? It is well established that seroconversion with multiple doses of IPV is increased by larger interval between IPV doses . A study in Cuba reported a higher type 2 seroconversion ( 89 % vs 83 % ) with two doses of IPV administered 2 months apart ( 8 and 16 weeks of age ) compared to three doses of IPV administered one month apart ( 6 , 10 and 14 weeks of age ) . The proposed trial will compare 2 doses of IPV ( at 6 and 14 weeks of age ) to a single dose of IPV administered at either 6 or 14 weeks of age . This trial would not only assess type 2 seroconversions with IPV but also determine priming against type 2 poliovirus with the different proposed IPV schedules . Additionally , all trial participants will receive bOPV at 6 , 10 and 14 weeks of age . This would permit the trial to determine type 1 and type 3 seroconversions observed with the combination of bOPV and IPV . Setting : Study area The study will be conducted in a suburb of Dhaka in the area of Mirpur . Mirpur is one of the 14 Thanas of Dhaka city with a population of about one million in an area of 59 square kilometers . Mirpur Thana of Dhaka city is divided into 14 sections .

University of Rochester,NCT02293499,Peer Led Asthma Self Management for Adolescents: PLASMA,University of Rochester,2,1,Asthma,Behavioral,PLASMA,Treatment,,"Asthma is a serious chronic health condition particularly in inner-city adolescents , who suffer disproportionately high asthma-related morbidity and mortality that place heavy economic burdens on families and society . There is a consensus that adverse asthma outcomes can be ameliorated by an individual 's active engagement in adequate self-management . This multi-site randomized controlled study proposes to implement and evaluate a peer-led asthma self-management for adolescents ( PLASMA ) program that has demonstrated its feasibility and preliminary efficacy in a previous study . PLASMA will be implemented in three cities ( Buffalo NY , Baltimore MD , and Memphis TN ) that have particularly high rates of pediatric asthma and asthma-related morbidity , and are thus most likely to benefit from the program . PLASMA comprises three main components : ( a ) peer-leader training ; ( b ) a one-day asthma camp where peer leaders will deliver manualized self-management content recommended by the national guidelines ; and ( c ) bi-monthly peer-leader contacts . Specific aims are : ( 1 ) to evaluate the effectiveness of PLASMA in inner-city adolescents with asthma in improving quality of life ( primary outcome ) , and asthma knowledge , attitudes , outcome expectations , self-efficacy , self-management skills , and asthma control , FEV1 ( exploratory outcomes ) over time , compared to a control group for whom adult leaders will deliver the same program content ; ( 2 ) to examine the mediating effects of the exploratory outcomes on quality of life ; ( 3 ) to examine the moderating effects of personal factors ( e.g. , age , sex , family support ) on the intervention 's primary and exploratory outcomes ; ( 4 ) to evaluate the effects of PLASMA on study outcomes in peer leaders ( 16-20 years ) ; and ( 5 ) to determine the economic impact of the intervention . These aims will be accomplished using a two-group randomized controlled trial with 378 adolescents ( 12-17 years ) from the three cities ( 126 for each site ) . A total of 42 qualified peer leaders ( 14 in each site ) will be enrolled based on adult nomination . Eligibility criteria for both peer leaders and adolescent learners include : a current asthma diagnosis ; persistent asthma ; absence of other chronic or mental illness ; inner-city residence ; and capability of verbal and written communication in English . Participants will provide data at enrollment ( T1 ) , camp ( T2 ) , and at 3- , 6- , 9- , 12- , and 15-months post-camp ( T3-T7 ) . Data will be analyzed using a multi-site hierarchical three-level linear mixed-effects model where level 1 represents repeated measures , level 2 = subject , and level 3 = site . To determine the economic impact of the program , investigator will measure the direct healthcare costs and total costs of the program , and perform net cost analyses for each type of costs . In addition , investigator will estimate cost-effectiveness ratios of the PLASMA group compared with the control .","Asthma , the most common pediatric chronic condition , is a serious problem for many adolescents . In 2010 , nearly 11 % of adolescents ( 2.7 million ) ages 12 through 17 years in the US reported current asthma . This age cohort suffers greater asthma-related morbidity and mortality than younger children . Asthma disproportionately affects inner-city youth , where asthma severity has increased and achieving optimum asthma control has been elusive . Several factors including poor socioeconomic conditions , life stresses , and environmental triggers have been found to be associated with poorly controlled asthma in inner-city children . Programs targeting asthma in inner-city children have primarily focused on the modification of environmental factors and addressing disparity in healthcare access . Limited intervention efforts have been directed to address high inner-city asthma morbidity specifically in adolescents by promoting adequate self-management . Dr. Rhee successfully completed an R21 ( NR009837 ) where she designed an evidence-based peer-led asthma self-management for adolescents ( PLASMA ) program and tested its efficacy in a randomized parallel group design in 112 urban and suburban adolescents with persistent asthma . The PLASMA program was implemented at a one-day camp and involved monthly follow-ups by peer leaders . The program was well received by participants , and relative to adolescents who received an adult-led program , the PLASMA group reported better quality of life and asthma control and fewer asthma-related urgent office visits . Subgroup analysis revealed that the program was particularly effective for inner-city adolescents in improving asthma outcomes compared with suburban participants . Given the disproportionate burdens of asthma in inner-city youth and the program 's compelling effects in this population , focusing on inner-city adolescents as a target of the PLASMA program is critical . Building on this previous trial of efficacy , the overall goal of the proposed study is to evaluate the effectiveness and generalizability of the peer-led intervention , PLASMA , in improving asthma outcomes in inner-city adolescents from three metropolitan cities in the Northern , Eastern and Southern US with distinctive historical and cultural backgrounds . Multisite studies have been advocated as an effective approach to strengthening external validity as such studies afford the opportunity to assess the extent to which treatment effects are generalizable to different settings . Ascertaining generalizability across sites is important as it guides future translation of study findings into policy and practice . This study will also determine long-term sustainability of PLASMA effects and estimate the economic impact of the intervention . This multi-site study is significant in that it will target the understudied population , inner-city adolescents with asthma in three cities in the US , who present serious challenges to optimum asthma management . Specific study aims are : To evaluate systematically the effectiveness of a peer-led asthma program in inner-city adolescents with persistent asthma . This aim will be accomplished by using a two-group randomized controlled trial with 378 adolescents ( 12-17 years ) from the three cities . The intervention group will receive PLASMA involving peer leader training , a one-day intense asthma self-management program led by peer leaders and bimonthly contacts from peer leaders . Intervention effects will be examined in comparison to the control group , who will receive the same program content delivered by adult leaders . Investigators hypothesize that : relative to the control group , the PLASMA group will report greater improvement over time in ( H1 ) quality of life ( primary outcome ) , and ( H2 ) asthma knowledge , attitudes , outcome expectations , self-efficacy , self-management skills , and asthma control , FEV1 ( exploratory outcomes ) . ( H3 ) The post-PLASMA scores on outcome measures will be higher than pre-program scores from both treatment groups . To examine the mediating effects of the secondary outcomes ( knowledge , attitudes , outcome expectations , self-efficacy , self-management skills , asthma control , and FEV1 ) on the primary outcome ( quality of life ) of the intervention . To examine the moderating effects of personal factors ( e.g. , age , sex , family support ) on primary and secondary outcomes of the intervention . To evaluate the effects of PLASMA on primary and exploratory outcomes in peer leaders ( 16-20 years ) . Investigators hypothesize that the peer leaders ( n=42 ) will report significant improvement in quality of life ( primary outcome ) and secondary outcomes ( knowledge , attitudes , outcome expectations , self-efficacy , self-management skills , asthma control and FEV1 ) over the course of 15 months . To determine the economic impact of the intervention . This aim will be accomplished by ( 5a ) measuring the direct healthcare costs and total costs of the PLASMA program , as compared with the control group ; ( 5b ) performing net cost analyses for each type of costs ; and ( 5c ) estimating cost-effectiveness ratios of the PLASMA group compared with the control . Investigators hypothesize that the direct and overall costs per participant in the PLASMA group will be less than costs per participant in the control group , or cost neutral .",2014-10-24,"March 11, 2021","Inclusion Criteria : Eligibility criteria for adolescent ( camp ) participants include : age between 12-17 years ; physician-diagnosed asthma that has required health service use ( preventive or acute ) within 12 months prior to recruitment ; persistent asthma determined by current use of a control medication or presenting at least one of the following four symptom levels in the past 4 weeks , as defined by the NAEPP guidelines91 : > 2 days/week of daytime symptoms , > 3-4 times of nighttime awakening , > 2 days/week of SABA use , or any interference with normal activities due to asthma ( 4 ) Investigators will include those with chronic health conditions except for those with conditions affecting respiratory system , heart disease , pneumonia , etc. , and those with moderate to severe cognitive impairments ; ( 5 ) primary residence located in the participating inner cities based on zip codes ; and ( 6 ) ability to understand spoken and written English .

Neuraxial blocks could provide adequate analgesia during and after abdominal surgery . However , neuraxial blocks have a lot of contraindicated situations and neuraxial anesthesia can easily induce hemodynamic abnormalities . Therefore , in most cases , the choice of anaesthetic management may be the general anesthesia . In addition to reduce the blood pressure and heart rate changes due to surgical stimulations , the large amount of opioids and anaesthetics may be required . Opioid related side effects can affect perioperative complications and postoperative quality of recovery .

Columbia University,NCT02297906,Pharmacokinetics of Intranasal Ketorolac in Children,Columbia University,1,0,Evaluating Pharmacokinetics of Intranasal Ketorolac,Drug,Ketorolac,Treatment,,Ketorolac is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAID ) that is typically given to both adults and children by the intravenous ( IV ) or intramuscular ( IM ) route for analgesic purposes . Ketorolac can also be given by the intranasal ( IN ) route using a mucosal atomization device ( MAD ) . We aim to study the pharmacokinetics of ketorolac when administered by the IN route using the MAD .,"The intranasal ( IN ) route of administering medications is an effective means of delivering analgesics to children in a painless and minimally distressing manner , especially in comparison to traditional means of intravenous ( IV ) or intramuscular ( IM ) administration , which require a painful and distressing needle stick . Ketorolac is an analgesic that is commonly administered to children , and can be given by the IN route , in addition to the IV and IM routes . However , the pharmacokinetics of intranasal ketorolac when administered in children has only been described in a limited fashion . The administration of IN ketorolac in children , using the proprietary SPRIX device , which atomizes a fixed amount of ketorolac , produces serum concentrations of ketorolac that are associated with analgesia . However , the concentrations of ketorolac achieved using a mucosal atomization device ( MAD ) has not yet been evaluated in children presenting to the emergency department . The MAD is a plastic device that attaches to the top of a syringe ( see figure ) . The MAD is much more commonly used for atomizing medications ; allows a variable dosage to be administered ; and has been shown to be a means of effectively delivering other analgesics and sedatives intranasally . The purpose of this study is to assess the pharmacokinetics of IN ketorolac when using a MAD to deliver the medication in children presenting to the emergency department .

Emory University,NCT02296840,Post-operative Pain Control After Pediatric Adenotonsillectomy,Emory University,4,0,Recurrent Tonsillitis,Drug,Ibuprofen,Treatment,Single,"Adenotonsillectomy is one of the most common surgical procedures performed in the pediatric population in the United States . It is generally a well-tolerated procedure with post-operative bleeding risk ranging from 3-5 % in children . Post-operative pain following adenotonsillectomy has significant morbidity and may result in prolonged hospital stay or re-admission to the hospital . Post-operative analgesia is most commonly managed with narcotic-containing pain medication . In recent years however , there is evidence that some patients may manifest increased sensitivity to narcotics , resulting in life-threatening respiratory compromise . Though there is a theoretical risk that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) increase bleeding time by disrupting platelet aggregation , evidence of detrimental effects ( i.e . increased risk of postoperative bleeding ) remains inconclusive for these generally well-tolerated medications . The goal of this study is to determine the incidence of post-operative bleeding and to determine the efficacy of NSAIDs in the management of post-operative pain following pediatric adenotonsillectomy , versus more commonly used narcotic pain medication . The study design will be an initial retrospective study to collect pilot data on the incidence of postoperative hemorrhage and indicators of adequate/inadequate pain control in children age 4 to 17 undergoing adenotonsillectomy . This will be followed by a prospective , randomized , single-blind controlled study in which orally-administered ibuprofen ( test intervention ) is compared to acetaminophen-hydrocodone ( control intervention ) in the postoperative period following adenotonsillectomy .","Post-operative pain management in pediatric patients undergoing adenotonsillectomy is challenging not only for the child , but also for the clinician and caregiver . Uncontrolled pain carries a high level of morbidity and can result in prolonged hospital stay and/or readmission , dehydration , weight loss , and other undesirable effects . In light of recent high-profile controversies regarding the safety of codeine the search for effective and safe analgesia continues . The American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery ( AAO-HNS ) guidelines suggest that NSAIDs are safe to use in the post-operative period . Here , the investigators compare bleeding risk and pain control using acetominophen-hydrocodone ( control ) versus ibuprofen ( intervention ) in the post-operative period in pediatric patients undergoing adenotonsillectomy . The investigators hypothesize that ibuprofen will not be associated with increased bleeding risk and will control post-operative pain as well as acetominophen-hydrocodone . Initial retrospective chart review ( Data to be extracted from the patients ' charts ) : Demographic data Surgical data Postoperative data Descriptive analysis to determine incidence of postoperative bleeding following adenotonsillectomy and its relation to demographic factors or surgical factors , incidence of postoperative pain problems and relation to demographic or surgical factors . Prospective , randomized , single-blind trial : Study Group Allocation/Randomization : Study participants will be randomized into two post-operative pain medication treatment arms , using block randomization . Patients who are randomized into the test intervention arm will receive ibuprofen ( 10mg/kg/day every 6-8 hours ) after surgery . Patients who are randomized into the control intervention will receive hydrocodone-acetaminophen ( 0.15mg/kg/day every 4-6 hours ) . This randomization will be performed by Ansley Roche MD , a co-investigator . The operating surgeons will be unaware of the group assignments at the time of randomization , at the time of surgery , and in the post-operative period . ( The participant and caregiver will not be blinded to the type of post-operative pain medication they will receive . ) Once a study participant has been randomized to group , the group assignment information will be provided to the otolaryngology resident at Egleston . The resident will write the appropriate prescription and provide this to the patient 's family prior to discharge . Postoperative pain assessment : Using the Faces Pain Scale , the pediatric patient will indicate his/her pain level at scheduled intervals . Pain level will be recorded by the caregiver and pain medication will be administered appropriately based on level of patient 's self-reported pain . A log of pain medication administered will be kept for each dose given . The total amount of pain medication administered per kg per day will be calculated by the study staff upon completion of the pain medication logs . Prior to surgery , a member of the study team will conduct a brief standard training session for parents to teach them how to correctly complete the medication log . Breakthrough pain : Patients who are randomized into the test intervention arm will receive ibuprofen ( 10mg/kg/day every 6-8 hours ) after surgery . Patients who are randomized into the control intervention will receive hydrocodone-acetaminophen ( 0.15mg/kg/day every 4-6 hours ) . Both post-operative intervention groups in this study will have surgery for the same preoperative indications ( adenotonsillitis or sleep disordered breathing ) . If patients experience pain that is not controlled with the specified intervention group medication , there will be a protocol in place for breakthrough pain , as indicated below . Surgeons will be blinded to the intervention arm . For patients who have pain that is not controlled by the randomized intervention , a breakthrough pain protocol will be enacted . The protocol is as follows : Test intervention arm Give hydrocodone-acetaminophen ( 0.15mg/kg/day hydrocodone ) for pain score ≥6 no more than ever 6 hours . If uncontrolled pain , see next bullet point . Increase hydrocodone-acetaminophen dose to 0.2mg/kg/day hydrocodone per dose . Control intervention arm Increase dose of hydrocodone-acetaminophen to 0.2 mg/kg/day hydrocodone For pain score ≥ 6 . If uncontrolled pain , see next bullet point . Ibuprofen 10mg/kg/day no more than every 6 hours . If uncontrolled pain , see next bullet point . Acetaminophen 10mg/kg/day every 6 hours as needed . Implementation of the breakthrough pain protocol will be documented . In order to maintain surgeon blinding throughout the study , patient phone calls will be routed to the chief resident on call who will follow the above breakthrough pain protocol .

Emory University,NCT02280655,Adverse Effects of Red Blood Cell Transfusions: A Unifying Hypothesis (Aim 3),Emory University,2,1,Cardiovascular Diseases,Biological,Storage-aged red blood cells (saRBCs) units,Treatment,Double,"Transfusion of red blood cells is often used in critically ill patients with low red blood cell counts to prevent disease progression and death . Recent studies suggest that the use of `` aged '' versus `` fresh '' red blood cells are associated with worse clinical outcomes . There is evidence that red blood cells work with the cells lining our blood vessels to produce a variety of substances that normally cause arteries to relax and increase blood supply . Two of these substances are called nitric oxide ( NO ) and endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor ( EDHF ) . The investigators are trying to determine the nature of these substances in human beings when they are transfused `` aged '' versus `` fresh '' red blood cells . The purpose of the study is to test the effects of transfusing `` aged '' versus `` fresh '' red blood cells in volunteers with traditional cardiovascular risk factors ( high blood pressure , diabetes , high cholesterol , and tobacco use ) on 1 ) the degree of relaxation in the arteries and subsequent changes in blood flow , 2 ) blood levels of oxidant molecules , 3 ) inflammation , and 4 ) stem cells . A similar study with healthy volunteers are further described in NCT00838331 .","Transfusion of red blood cells ( RBCs ) is often effective at preventing morbidity and mortality in anemic patients . In contrast , recent studies indicate that some RBC components may have functional defects ( `` RBC storage lesions '' ) that actually cause morbidity and mortality when transfused . For example , patients transfused with RBCs stored > 14 days have statistically worse outcomes than those receiving `` fresher '' RBC units . In addition to the age of stored RBCs , the volume transfused may be important . The Transfusion Requirements in Critical Care ( TRICC ) study showed that specific patients whose transfusions were limited by a restrictive trigger ( RBCs transfusions only when hemoglobin [ Hb ] < 7 g/dL ) had significantly better outcomes than those transfused with a more liberal trigger ( [ Hb ] < 10 g/dL Hb ) . This finding has been particularly difficult to understand since conventional wisdom suggests that an elevated [ Hb ] should be beneficial because it supports increased oxygen ( O2 ) delivery . Recipient-specific factors may also contribute to the occurrence of these adverse events . Unfortunately , these events have been difficult to investigate because up to now they have existed only as `` statistical occurrences '' of increased morbidity and mortality in large data sets . There are currently no clinical or laboratory methods to detect or study them in individual patients . The microcirculation is composed of a continuum of small vessels including small arterioles , capillaries , and post-capillary venules . The microcirculation represents an actively-adjusting vascular circuit that matches blood flow ( and O2 delivery ) to local tissue oxygen demands . While the physiologic mechanisms that match O2 delivery to local requirements are incompletely understood , endothelium-derived nitric oxide ( NO ) clearly plays an important role . Interestingly , recent work has revealed that in addition to transporting O2 and carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) , the RBC also controls local NO concentrations and thus may also play a surprisingly important role in regulating blood flow in the microcirculation . Herein , the investigators bring together previously unconnected data to propose a unifying hypothesis , centered on insufficient NO bioavailability ( INOBA ) , to explain the increased morbidity and mortality observed in some patients following RBC transfusion . In this model , variables associated with RBC units ( storage time ; 2,3-diphosphoglycerate ( 2,3-DPG ) concentration ) and transfusion recipients ( endothelial dysfunction ; hematocrit [ Hct ] ) collectively lead to changes in NO levels in vascular beds . Under certain circumstances , these variables are `` aligned '' such that NO concentrations are markedly reduced , leading to vasoconstriction , decreased local blood flow and insufficient O2 delivery to end organs . Under these circumstances , the likelihood of morbidity and mortality escalates . The INOBA hypothesis is attractive because of its explanatory power and because it leads to a number of readily testable predictions , which will be investigated t determine the effects of transfused RBCs in patients with endothelial dysfunction due to cardiovascular disease . A non-invasive ultrasound assay will be used to test whether patients with cardiovascular disease and endothelial dysfunction ( who have intrinsic defects in NO synthesis ) are more susceptible to adverse effects from stored/processed RBCs ( impaired in NO bioavailability ) than fresh RBC units . Vasodilation and tissue oxygenation in response to transfusion will be monitored , and Framingham risk scores and cardiovascular disease biomarkers will be tested as potential predictive factors to identify patients most at risk from adverse effects of RBC transfusions .",2014-10-29,"April 7, 2016","Inclusion Criteria : Inpatient or outpatient at Emory University Hospital who 's physicians have ordered a transfusion of packed red blood cells ( pRBCs ) of 1 or more units Cardiovascular risk factors ( hypercholesterolemia , diabetes , hypertension , and tobacco smoking ) or known cardiovascular disease ) will be carefully documented for each subject Cardiac risk factors are defined as follows : Hypercholesterolemia : Defined as serum low density lipoprotein cholesterol > 140 mg/dL if not currently on lipid-lowering therapy or > 100 mg/dL if on lipid-lowering therapy Diabetes : Defined as having fasting blood glucose sample of > 126 mg/dL or a hemoglobin A1c of > 7 % or being treated with diabetes medications such as oral hypoglycemic agents , insulin sensitizing agents , or subcutaneous insulin Smoking : active tobacco use , 20 cigarettes per day for the past year Hypertension : Blood pressure of > 140/90 or currently on anti-hypertensive medications Cardiovascular disease : known coronary artery disease by angiogram or documented myocardial infarction Exclusion Criteria : Pregnancy Previous transfusion within one week .

DLBCL is a cancer of a type of blood cell called B-lymphocytes . B lymphocytes are part of the body 's immune system . There are different types of DLBCL . About a third of newly diagnosed DLBCL cancers are the ABC type . It has been observed that treatment does not work as well for patients with the ABC type compared to patients with other DLBCL types who receive standard treatment . However , at this time both ABC type and other DLBCL type patients receive the same standard treatments . Patients with DLBCL who are otherwise healthy are usually treated first with the chemotherapy drug combination called R-CHOP . The drugs in this combination are `` R '' for rituximab , `` C '' for cyclophosphamide , `` H '' for doxorubicin which has a chemical name of hydroxydaunomycin , `` O '' for vincristine which has a trade name of oncovin , and `` P '' for prednisone .

Treatment is usually a bone marrow transplant from a fully matched donor . Researchers want to try using partially matched donors for patients who do not have a fully matched donor available . The researchers will also use the drug cyclophosphamide to try to improve the outcomes when using a partially matched donor . Objective : - To learn the effectiveness of using cyclophosphamide with a transplant from a partially matched donor in treating CGD . Eligibility : - Recipients : age 2-65 with CGD with an ongoing infection that has not been cured by standard treatment and no fully matched donor available in an appropriate timeframe . Design : Recipients will : be admitted to the hospital 2 weeks before transplant . be screened with blood and urine tests , breathing and heart health tests , X-rays , and/or magnetic resonance imaging .

However donor availability remains a limiting factor in the application of this treatment modality . The use of haploidentical donors has in the past been fraught with a greater rate of complications related to both higher rates of GvHD and delayed immunorecovery . Newer transplant regimens appear to have diminished these risks and improved outcomes . We propose using a subablative conditioning regimen followed by post-transplant cyclophosphamide for patients with CGD who do not have an HLA matched donor but whose circumstances necessitate the use of a potentially curative , albeit high-risk treatment modality .",2014-11-04,"April 30, 2020","INCLUSION CRITERIA : Must have sufficient complications from underlying disease to warrant undergoing transplantation Ages 2 years - 65 years No appropriate HLA matched donor ( available donor has greater than 1 mismatch or the single mismatch is not at DQ for unrelated donors ( including cord blood products ) , or no available 6 out of 6 HLA matched related donor ) , or patients who may have an unrelated donor , but whose clinical status is such that the time required to obtain an unrelated donor would be life threatening .

Many efforts have focused on the validation of new formula to estimate GFR from endogenous markers . Nevertheless , the performance of these formula is limited by a large inter individual variability , that requires in many cases the use of GFR measurement using exogenous tracers ( extreme anthropometric characteristics , abnormal production of endogenous tracers , potential kidney donors , dose adjustment , nephrotoxicity monitoring… ) . The use of GFR measurement is burdened by a lack of availability due to methodological , biological and regulatory ( for radioactive tracers ) constraints . That 's why a need exists for new validated tracers that will be more accessible and easier to use . Moreover , there are differences between the measurement techniques : single injection of the tracer or concentration equilibrium obtained by continuous infusion ; plasma or urinary clearance . Two new tracers for GFR measurement are here offered for validation : Gd-DOTA and Calcium-EDTA . Gd-DOTA is a macrocyclic paramagnetic contrast product , which can be measured using an ELISA type immunoassay . Although being widely used in radiology with higher doses than those that will be used for GFR measurement in the multi-GFR study , Gd-DOTA has never been involved in systemic nephrogenic fibrosis cases ( ProFinest study ) . Calcium-EDTA has been used for many years for the chelation of heavy metals . Recently , a colorimetric assay for Calcium-EDTA measurement has been developed .

Aim : Compare the role of left prefrontal cortex anodal t-DCS daily stimulation of 4 weeks ( 20 week days ) with sham stimulation in alleviating depressive symptoms in patients with TRD . Methodology : Patients who seek treatment in our treatment resistant depression clinic and who have failed to respond to treatment with two antidepressant medications will be offered to enroll in this study . The aim is to study 20 patients who meet the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , 4th Edition ( DSM-IV ) criteria for MDD between the ages of 21-65 years . Those subjects that receive sham stimulation will be offered to have active t-DCS stimulation for additional 3 weeks to get any benefit that they may have otherwise missed by being in the sham stimulation group . Results and Conclusions : The investigators will compare the mean baseline and end of treatment Montgomery Asberg depression rating scale between the two groups . The investigators will compare the change in mean depression scores between the baseline and end of treatment in those receiving active t-DCS for a total of 7 weeks duration . This study is innovative and of significance in exploring the role of this novel , easy to administer , safe and cost effective treatment modality .","Research Plan : Patients who score > 10 on our intake screening questionnaire , the patient Health Questionnaire ( PHQ-9 ) will be advised to call to seek participation in this study . Patients who seek treatment in our treatment resistant depression clinic will be offered to enroll in this study . Patients who have failed to respond to at least two antidepressants in adequate dosage for at least 4 weeks . The aim is to have 20 patients complete the study by enrolling 24 patients and screening another 26 patients who meet the diagnostic and statistical manual , DSM-IV criteria for Major depressive disorder , MDD and have failed treatment with at least two antidepressant medications . Patients will be interviewed by investigators to see if they meet the eligibility for inclusion in the study . The evaluation will consist a medical and psychiatric evaluation if not done in last one year and a monthly urine pregnancy test for women of child bearing potential . If the subjects do not meet the eligibility criteria they will continue to receive routine clinical care or referral for appropriate psychiatric care within or outside of our clinic/department Stimulation parameters : Left prefrontal anodal t-DCS stimulation daily for four weeks . The stimulation parameters : current 2 mA continuously for 30 minutes . Conductive electrodes covered by sponge soaked in saline will be used . The current will gradually be increased to 2mA over 30 seconds to avoid sensation of a flash . Patients will be allotted to receive either active or sham stimulation by using a random numbers assignment ( www.randomizer.org ) . Co-investigator Dr. Holbert will be doing the assessments rating the depressive symptoms and he kept blind as to the type of stimulation received . The same machine will be used to give both active and sham stimulation . At the end of four weeks subjects will be offered to stay in open label extension of this study with active left prefrontal anodal t-DCS for another three weeks to receive any benefits they may otherwise not receive by being in sham stimulation . Materials : Montgomery Asberg depression rating scale , MADRS , Patient Health Questionnaire , PHQ-9 , Clinical Global Impression ( CGI ) at baseline and weekly . Improvement will be considered as 50 % reduction in depressive scores and remission as a score of less than 9 on MADRS . MADRS is a 10 item examiner rated scale that rates various depressive signs and symptoms and has been used extensively in research of brain stimulation techniques.PHQ-9 is a 9 item self-rated questionnaire about depressive symptoms and has been found reliable in studies of depression in primary care and psychiatric settings . CGI is a clinician rated impression about treatment response . Procedure outline : Baseline : diagnostic interview , evaluation of inclusion and exclusion criteria , urine pregnancy test if indicated at baseline and day 31 , filling in questionnaires : PHQ-9 , MADRS , CGI Daily : t-DCS stimulation for 30 minutes ; patients will be asked about any discomfort/side effects .

The treatment duration of the study will be at least 5 days or maximum 7 days depending upon the treatment response . Subjects will be assessed on Day 5 and if Investigator feels the need of continuing the treatment at Day 5 then treatment will be continued till Day 7 . For subjects who do not show treatment response on Day 5 , assessments will be performed on Day 7 .","This two-arm , parallel , comparative , observer blind , randomised study will be performed in adult subjects both male and female ≥18 years of age who present with acute odontogenic infection with or without abscess . A total of 472 subjects will be randomised in 1:1 ratio to get 205 evaluable subjects in each study arm . After obtaining informed consent , subject will undergo surgical intervention including surgical incisions , drainages , removal of the involved tooth , debridement , puncture lavage or trephination , if deemed necessary by the Investigator . These surgical interventions will be performed before the start of study treatment . On Day 0 after confirming the eligibility , subjects will be randomised to either of the study arms . The treatment duration of the study will be at least 5 days which may increase to 7 days , if Investigator feels the need of continuing the treatment at Day 5 . In such cases clinical assessment will be done again at Day 7 . Thus the efficacy evaluation will be performed at baseline ( Day 0 ) prior to study drug administration and on Day 5 and/ or 7 . Safety laboratory evaluations will be performed at Screening Visit and will be repeated at end of study treatment i.e . either on Day 5 or Day 7 . On Baseline , Day 2 , Day 5 and/ or Day 7 , Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) will be used to measure amount of pain and swelling that a subject will experience . This scale has numerical ratings from 0 to 10 . Zero would mean `` No pain '' and 10 would mean `` Worst possible pain '' . The subject will be asked to choose the most appropriate score on VAS which best describes his/her pain status over last 24 hours . While using VAS for swelling , zero would mean `` No swelling '' and 10 would mean `` Maximum possible swelling '' . The Investigator will choose the most appropriate score on VAS which best describes subject 's swelling . Sample for microbiological culture will be obtained at the discretion of Investigator while performing the surgical procedure . When microbiological culture is indicated and feasible , two sets ( each consisting of aerobic and anaerobic media ) will be obtained . This sampling will be done in approximately 80 subjects randomly who will provide consent at Screening . The sample will be collected and dispatched in appropriate transport medium to the central laboratory for culture and antibiotic susceptibility . Protocol waivers or exemptions will not be allowed . The total duration of each subject 's participation will be 6-9 days including Screening period of 0-1 day ( Day -1 to Day 0 ) and Treatment period of 5-7 days ( Day 0 to Day 5-7 ) . The primary objective of the study is to compare clinical efficacy ( cure and improvement ) of both the treatment arms which uses VAS for assessment of pain and swelling . Since the clinical efficacy parameters are subjective , it is mandatory to keep the observer/Investigator blinded during the study assessment . In addition , designing blinded study is challenging owing to different dosage regimen and formulation of study drugs . The study design of double blind double dummy is not recommended in view of increased pill burden which in turn can have an impact on treatment compliance . The possibility of over-encapsulation is ruled out due to large pill size of amoxicillin + clavulanic acid . Therefore to maintain blinding of Investigators , the study is designed as observer blind with Investigator remaining blinded throughout the study period . An unblinded study team member will be appointed for each site who will be involved in dispensing of the study drugs to subjects . The unblinded study team member will remain present during subject assessment for all study visits and will ensure that Investigator remains blinded to treatment assignment .

Dopamine ( DA ) neurotransmission is implicated in these neural functions and dopaminergic pathways are recognized to be frequently disrupted after TBI . One of the most widely used DAergic drugs is methylphenidate ( Ritalin® ) . Methylphenidate increases synaptic DA levels by binding to presynaptic dopamine transporters ( DAT ) and blocking re-uptake . PET with methylphenidate challenge to measure tonic DA release provides valuable insight into the molecular basis of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) and addiction , as well as practical information regarding likely effectiveness of therapy ( 1 ) . The objectives of this study are to use PET imaging with [ 11C ] -raclopride , a D2/D3 receptor ligand , before and after administering methylphenidate , to measure endogenous DA release in patients who are experiencing problems with cognition , attention and executive function in the chronic stage after TBI . In addition , we will use TMS to test short intracortical inhibition , a gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor A ( GABAA ) - mediated phenomenon , which is under partial DA control , as a measure of dopaminergic activity on and off methylphenidate .","Males and females ( n=30 ) , between the ages of 18 and 55 years in the chronic stage after TBI who experience deficits in neuropsychological function from TBIs incurred 6 months after the injury , will be recruited from military treatment facilities or civilian clinics when presenting for clinical management of TBI or post-concussive symptoms . 1 . Study participants will be evaluated using brain MRI , psychometric measures adapted from the TBI Common Data Elements , attention tests and information about details of the injury and experience of post-concussive symptoms will be recorded . Transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) with placebo and with methylphenidate ( 60 mg by mouth ) challenge will be performed to predict a stimulant response . 2 . Subjects will be studied with [ 11C ] -raclopride PET in two imaging sessions . One session will be after administration of placebo and the other after methylphenidate , 60 mg by mouth . Both placebo and methylphenidate will be given 60 minutes prior to injection of [ 11C ] -raclopride to allow for peak uptake of methylphenidate in the brain . The binding potential of [ 11C ] -raclopride relative to a non-displaceable reference region ( cerebellum ) , BPND , will be used as a measure of D2/D3 receptor availability . The difference in BPND between methylphenidate and placebo ( ΔBPND ) is used to measure of tonic DA release . 3 . Subjects will then be treated with oral methylphenidate , using a forced titration up to a dose of 30 mg given twice daily for 4 weeks . At that point , the neuropsychologic tests are repeated . Outcome measures : The primary outcome is change in information processing speed during neuropsychologic testing .",2014-05-20,"October 2, 2018","Inclusion Criteria : Age 18 - 55 years , inclusive A history of having sustained a moderate or severe TBI > 6 months prior to enrollment .

As such , this study aims to a ) further characterize the unique deficits in social cognition ( recognition and interpretation of social cues and representation of thoughts , intentions , and feelings of others ) across disorders , including the schizophrenia spectrum ( which includes schizophrenia , SCZ , schizoaffective disorder , SAD , bipolar disorder , BD , and schizotypal personality disorder , SPD ) , the autism spectrum disorders ( ASD ) , and borderline personality disorder ( BPD ) compared to healthy controls ( HC ) ; b ) assess the effect of intranasal oxytocin ( OXT ) as a regulator and novel treatment of social cognition impairment in these disorders ; and c ) enhance our understanding of the specificity and exact mechanisms of impairment to inform the accurate dosing of OXT required to modulate social cognition in these disorders and identify a model of optimum social cognitive function . Addressing these questions will further catalyze research into a model of optimum social cognitive activity , and accelerate industry development of agents suited to routine clinical administration .","Social cognitive impairments , particularly deficits and distortions in recognition and interpretation of social cues and representations of thoughts , intentions , and feelings of others-termed mentalization-are a key contributor to the pathology and morbidity of a number of psychiatric disorders , including the schizophrenia spectrum , the autism spectrum and personality disorders . Individuals with schizophrenia spectrum disorders have deficits in social cognition ( hypomentalization ) , while individuals with borderline personality disorder seem to have exaggerated and distorted social cognition ( hypermentalization ) . However , the specificity and mechanisms of these impairments remain unclear . Therefore , a better understanding of the modulation of social cognition is a priority for developing interventions both pharmacologic and psychosocial . We propose here to examine the effects of oxytocin , known to be a key regulator of social cognition through modulating frontolimbic neural circuitry , on social cognition in schizotypal and borderline patients . In doing so , we aim to characterize a model of optimum social cognitive activity to direct the development of treatments , including dosing and target population-specific effects . To this end , we propose to perform a 2-year study in which 105 patients , ( 45 with schizophrenia spectrum disorders , 30 with borderline personality disorder , and 30 with autism spectrum disorders ) will perform 3 rounds of social cognition testing after three acute single-dose treatment conditions ( intranasal oxytocin dose of 24IU or 40IU or placebo ) separated by a washout period , in a repeated-measures , within-subjects , randomized , placebo-controlled , double-blind , counterbalanced cross-over proof-of concept design . 30 healthy controls will not receive oxytocin/placebo and will perform 3 rounds of social cognition tests separated by approximately 4 weeks , serving as a benchmark for normal performance and a control for practice effects . Social cognitive testing will be performed 45 minutes after drug/placebo administration in an identical protocol each time . The social cognitive test serving as primary outcome measure will be the Movie for the Assessment of Social Cognition ( MASC ) . We will also include other tests of social cognition and symptom measures , to evaluate scope of effects . We will compare outcome measures at baseline ( placebo day ) in schizotypal and borderline patients and healthy controls , and in schizotypal and borderline patients across drug doses and placebo administration . Furthermore , 60 subjects ( 15 HC , 15 with schizophrenia spectrum disorders , 15 BPD , and 15 with autism spectrum disorders , either new subjects or already enrolled subjects ) will be expected to complete an add-on MRI component of the study , after signing an additional consent form . For the MRI portion of the study , these subjects will perform 2 more rounds of social cognition testing after receiving double-blind intranasal oxytocin ( 40 IU ) or placebo in randomized order , in a cross-over , within-subjects design , separated by approximately a 1-week washout . The subjects will receive the study medication directly prior to beginning an fMRI scan that will last approximately two hours . Oxytocin levels will be measured before oxytocin administration and every 10-15 minutes until about 2 hours and 30 minutes post-administration . The remainder of the protocol will remain the same .",2014-05-21,"October 6, 2022","Inclusion Criteria : 18 ≤ age ≤ 65 Medically and neurologically healthy Willing and able to provide informed consent IQ≥80 Exclusion Criteria : Currently meets for a psychotic episode Clinically significant cardiovascular or neurological conditions , traumatic brain injury , uncontrolled hypertension , clinically significant EKG abnormalities , or serious general medical illness Clinical evidence of dehydration or significant hypotension ; pregnant or lactating Currently meets DSM-IV-TR criteria for MDD Current substance abuse ( last 6 months ) or past dependence on stimulants , opioids or other potentially neurotoxic drugs Currently taking psychotropic or other systemic medications Non-English speaking",92,0,18 Years,65 Years
University of Manitoba,NCT02148094,Demonstrating Safety and Effective Delivery of Daily Oral Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) for Sex Workers in India,University of Manitoba,0,1,HIV Infection,Drug,Truvada,Prevention,,"Female sex workers ( FSWs ) in India are at high risk of HIV infection , and while correct and consistent condom use is an effective means of preventing HIV transmission , many FSWs have difficulty insisting on their use . Alternative HIV prevention options are needed for FSWs who are unable to correctly and consistently use condoms with their clients or regular partners . Oral pre-exposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) may be an important tool to fill this critical prevention gap , and a demonstration project is required to assess the impact and feasibility of the use of PrEP as an HIV prevention intervention among most at risk FSWs in India . The proposed project will take place at two sites in India and will assess the use of a risk assessment tool to identify FSWs who would most benefit from PrEP , collect information about the reasons why FSWs choose to accept or decline PrEP , evaluate two different PrEP delivery strategies ( weekly clinic pick-up or home delivery by peer educators every second day ) , monitor adherence to and discontinuation of PrEP , and evaluate unintended consequences of the use of PrEP in these communities ( e.g . reduction of condom use , drug side effects or adverse events , social harms or resistance ) . To ensure the safety of study participants , a community advisory board will be set up and will meet regularly to inform study staff of any concerns that the community may have related to the study , so that the study staff can respond in a timely manner . A data safety and monitoring board will also be established to monitor participant safety .","This PrEP demonstration study is designed to assess the feasibility and impact of delivering PrEP in addition to the existing package of HIV prevention interventions available to female sex workers in India . The study aims to : 1 ) identify female sex workers in need of HIV prevention and willing to take PrEP ; 2 ) evaluate sustained uptake and adherence to oral PrEP ; 3 ) assess safe delivery of PrEP ; and 4 ) demonstrate effective delivery of PrEP within the context of the National Program of Targeted Interventions . The study will be implemented in two regions and among two typologies of female sex workers in India : brothel-based FSWs in Kolkata and FSWs operating from different settings in Mysore and Mandya . Outcome 1 : Identification of female sex workers in need of HIV prevention and willing to take oral PrEP For optimal delivery with limited resources , it is critical to provide HIV prevention strategies such as PrEP to populations at greatest risk of infection . Female sex workers are an important population for HIV prevention in India , prioritized as a `` core high risk group '' for targeted interventions by the India National AIDS Control Organization ( NACO ) ( NACO 2013 annual report ) . In particular , some FSWs report inconsistent condom use and have unmet needs for HIV prevention ( Ramesh , 2010 ; Reza-Paul , 2008 ) . For example , these women may be less empowered or able to consistently demand condom use by their clients or may wish to become pregnant . PrEP has the potential to be an additional , more acceptable and effective HIV prevention method for female sex workers who have difficulty using condoms consistently . This study proposes the development and use of a risk screening tool to identify female sex workers who are most vulnerable to HIV . This tool will guide recruitment into the demonstration study and could later assist health providers in deciding who will benefit most from PrEP for HIV prevention . In addition , this study will assess the proportion of FSWs identified by the risk screening tool who are willing to take PrEP . Quantitative and qualitative evaluations will identify factors related to the decision to initiate PrEP as well as reasons why FSWs decline PrEP . Outcome 2 : Sustained uptake and adherence to oral PrEP among female sex workers Similar to all medications , sustained uptake and adherence to PrEP is fundamental for efficacy in preventing HIV acquisition . In the four clinical trials of oral PrEP that demonstrated efficacy , study participants with high adherence had the greatest protection from HIV ( Baeten 2012 , Choopanya 2013 , Grant 2010 , Thigpen 2012 ) . Likewise , across PrEP trials , there was a clear relationship between higher efficacy and a greater proportion of participants with study drug detectable in their blood . Two randomized clinical trials of daily oral PrEP among heterosexual women in Africa found no efficacy for HIV prevention ; poor adherence to PrEP most likely explains these results ( Marrazzo 2013 , Van Damme 2012 ) . For example , drug level testing in the FEM-PrEP Study found that less than 40 % of a random sample of HIV negative women in the PrEP arm of the study had detectable levels of PrEP in their blood ( Van Damme 2012 ) . Analyses of high-risk subgroups of study participants in the Partners PrEP Study found PrEP efficacy estimates ranged from 64 to 84 % , showing consistently high efficacy of PrEP in preventing HIV across various higher risk groups , including women ( Murnane 2013 ) . Preliminary community awareness campaigns for PrEP among female sex workers in Kolkata found high interest in PrEP - approximately 80 % reported willingness to take daily , oral PrEP . Sex workers in Mysore-Mandya are engaged in series of consultations where information related to PrEP as a tool for combination prevention is being discussed and questions or concerns related to PrEP addressed . In both places , initial observations show that there are some sex workers ( e.g . those who are on long time contracts , those with overnight clients where sometimes the number of clients are not disclosed , those who want to be pregnant , and those who do not use condoms with their regular partners ) expressed interest in being part of the demonstration project . This PrEP demonstration study will assess the acceptability and feasibility of two approaches to PrEP delivery : 1 ) peer educator delivery every other day ; or 2 ) weekly clinic pick-up . Study staff will measure PrEP initiation , adherence and discontinuation . They will record these events in participant records , and quarterly visits will be used to assess adherence through biological tests and questionnaires . PrEP will be delivered as part of a package of HIV prevention services , and therefore use of other prevention strategies , such as condom use , will also be monitored . The full package of prevention services will continue to be provided to FSWs with the support of India 's national government and in accordance with national guidelines . Data on drug adherence and condom use will be collected through various means . An ethnographic study will be designed to understand factors that may promote or impede adherence to PrEP , as well as changes in risk behaviour ( reduction in condom use ) . In addition to this , peer educators will use a pictorial tool to document these items ( e.g. , frequency and patterns of sexual activity , condom use , and PrEP use ) . The study will also include a biological measure of PrEP adherence through the assessment of drug-levels in the blood . Regular counselling about HIV prevention and PrEP will be provided to study participants to promote adherence . In a sub-sample of study participants , an electronic adherence monitoring device to measure and promote adherence , Helping Hands , will be tested ( De Blaser 2010 ) . The Helping Hands device is complimented by a web platform that illustrates patient-specific data to monitor dosing history and adherence patterns . Outcome 3 : Oral HIV PrEP as part of a combined prevention package delivered safely for female sex workers Four randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that daily , oral PrEP is safe for HIV-uninfected women in a wide range of settings ; these antiretrovirals have been proven safe for HIV-infected women for many years of use . The most common side effects of FTC/TDF are minor and short-lived ( i.e . first several weeks ) . This study will provide evidence for the safe delivery of oral PrEP to female sex workers in brothel and street-based settings in India . Quarterly clinic visits will assess physical health , side effects , adverse events and any other social harms or concerns with PrEP use . This study will invest in continuous engagement with communities of female sex workers according to good participatory practice guidelines to provide correct information about PrEP , keep communities continuously engaged , and maintain adherence to PrEP . A community advisory board ( CAB ) and a Data Safety and Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) will be set up . The CAB will meet monthly and on an as needed basis . It will inform study staff of any concerns that the community may have related to the study , so that the study staff can respond in a timely manner . The CAB members will be close to the community and will be able to respond to community concerns by calling meetings to address issues in a timely manner . The DSMB will be set up to ensure that the rights of the study participants are safeguarded in a transparent fashion , and to monitor their safety by scrutinizing any adverse events . The DSMB will also help to respond to concerns raised by the CAB . The DSMB will include an ethicist , a human rights lawyer , representatives from University of Manitoba , WHO and UNAIDS , representatives from the global network of sex workers , and a statistician . In addition , ongoing qualitative research and monitoring by research staff , as well as outreach by peer educators , will attempt to identify any community resistance , rumours or actual harms , and respond in an appropriate manner . Outcome 4 : Effective delivery of oral HIV PrEP demonstrated in context of National Program of Targeted Interventions This study proposes to deliver PrEP within the context of the National Program of Targeted Interventions in order to demonstrate that PrEP is feasible in `` real world '' settings . DMSC and Ashodaya currently implement targeted intervention programs for female sex workers in Kolkata and Mysore/Mandya , respectively . These programs provide outreach by peer educators and outreach workers , clinic services ( e.g . HIV testing and counseling , STI screening and treatment ) , and referrals for HIV care and treatment for brothel- and street-based FSWs . This study will evaluate the addition of PrEP to this existing service delivery model . It will also show willingness of participants to enroll in a demonstration study and to use oral PrEP without reimbursements or incentives for participation . Study findings can inform national and local government 's decision to adopt PrEP as a new HIV prevention strategy . Development of HIV prevention packages , provider training , quality management and service delivery guidelines in line with national systems will provide guidance for real life implementation of PrEP , and also contribute to the larger goal of providing standards for the delivery of HIV prevention interventions . Risk Mitigation Identification of willing participants : The development of a tool to correctly identify those FSWs at continued risk of HIV infection does not ensure that those women will be willing to take PrEP . Though initial interest in PrEP is strong in Sonagachi among FSWs in general , women at highest risk may be different . A feasibility study to identify levels of awareness about PrEP , perceptions and misconceptions about PrEP , and optimum ways to present PrEP accurately to identify those women at greatest need with greatest interest in using PrEP is about to begin in Mysore . Research ethics : All study materials will be submitted for approval by the institutional review boards of Durbar Mahila Samanwaya Committee ( DMSC ) Ethical Committee , the World Health Organization ( WHO ) Ethics Review Committee ( ERC ) , the University of Manitoba ( UM ) Health Research Ethics Board ( HREB ) , and by the Indian Council on Medical Research ( ICMR ) through the Health Ministry 's Screening Committee ( HMSC ) . The procedures , risks , and benefits of study participation will be explained to all potential study participants and informed consent will be obtained from those who are willing to participate prior to their participation in the study . The project will follow all guidelines for human subjects research as mandated by the Government of India , as this is the location of the proposed project . In addition to this , a Data Safety and Monitoring Board will be established at Ashodaya to monitor the safety of participants and the scientific integrity of the study across all study sites . Community advisory board ( CAB ) : A community advisory board will be set up in each study site , and will meet regularly to inform study staff and the DSMB of any concerns that the community may have related to the study , so that the study staff can respond in a timely manner . Data Safety and Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) : A DSMB will be established to ensure that the rights of all study participants from each site , Ashodaya and DMSC , are safeguarded , and to monitor their safety by scrutinizing any adverse events . They will also respond to concerns raised by the CABs from each site . The DSMB will include an ethicist , a human rights lawyer , representatives from the University of Manitoba , WHO and UNAIDS , representatives from the global network of sex workers , and a statistician .",2014-05-22,"October 10, 2018",Inclusion Criteria : Self-identification as a current FSW Age 18 and older Self-reported interest in and willingness to take PrEP Score cutoff on risk screening tool / PrEP indication tool HIV-negative test at time of enrollment ( per testing algorithm ) No clinical signs of acute HIV infection Hepatitis-B virus antigen negative ( upon screening ) Creatinine clearance ≥ 60ml/min ( Cockcroft-Gault formula ) ( upon screening ) Not currently taking PrEP or enrolled in another PrEP demonstration project Negative urine pregnancy test at time of enrollment Lives within the catchment area of the project site and no plans to move away from the project area in the next 16 months Exclusion Criteria : Under 18 Does not meet inclusion criteria,1325,1,18 Years,49 Years

Vanderbilt University Medical Center,NCT02149901,Water and Sudafed in Autonomic Failure,Vanderbilt University,0,0,Shy-Drager Syndrome,Drug,Pseudoephedrine + 480 ml water,Other,,"The specific aim of this study is to determine whether water ingestion potentiates the pressor response to pseudoephedrine in patients with primary disorders of autonomic failure . The study design will enable us to also evaluate the pressor response to water alone and to pseudoephedrine alone . In a secondary analysis , we will compare the results in patients with two autonomic disorders , pure autonomic failure ( PAF ) and multiple system atrophy ( MSA ) . We hypothesize that drinking water following a dose of pseudoephedrine will lead to a greater increase in blood pressure than pseudoephedrine alone .","The maximal pressor response to water is reached when other pressor agents are only beginning to act . In addition to the therapeutic value of water ingestion alone , the blood pressure-raising effects of agents that increase sympathetic nervous system tone , such as phenylpropanolamine , are potentiated by water drinking . These drug interaction effects can be exploited in the treatment of orthostatic hypotension with the combination of water and a sympathomimetic potentially able to increase blood pressure to a greater extent and for a longer period of time than either water or the medication alone . However , the interaction can also lead to potentially dangerous blood pressure surges . This protocol requires an initial screening history and physical of study participants , including safety labs and EKGs , and evaluation of their autonomic nervous system status following the consent process . If the patient meets study criteria and is willing to undergo study testing , the 4-way crossover protocol will follow . Study Testing days 1 and 2 Arm 1 : Pseudoephedrine 30 mg PO + 50 ml water Arm 2 : Pseudoephedrine 30 mg PO + 480 ml water Testing will be performed at the same time of day for all studies , at least 2 hours after a meal to avoid any confounding effects from postprandial hypotension . A saline lock will be inserted for blood sampling at least 30 minutes before baseline data collection . Participants will be asked to empty their bladders before beginning the test to avoid any effect of a full urinary bladder on peripheral sympathetic activity . Participants will be seated comfortably in a chair . They will be asked to remain in the seated position for the duration of the study . The Dinamap electrocardiographic and blood pressure ( brachial cuff ) recorder will be attached to the patient and set up for measurements every 5 minutes throughout the study with digital download into the ADC ( Autonomic Dysfunction Center ) BP database . Participants will also be instrumented with EKG , finger cuff and sensor for continuous monitoring of blood pressure , heart rate , respiration , SpO2 , stroke volume , systemic vascular resistance , and cardiac output , using a Nexfin system and Ivy Biomedical Vital-Guard monitor . After a 30 minute baseline monitoring period ( time -30 min to 0 min ) , 4 ½ teaspoons of blood will be collected for osmolality measurement and assays of hormones that regulate blood pressure . The subject will then be given 30 mg of pseudoephedrine PO ( time 0 min ) . Monitoring will be continued for 45 minutes . At 45 minutes , the participant will be asked to drink 50 ml ( Arm 1 ) or 480 ml ( Arm 2 ) of water . Additional blood samples ( 4 ½ teaspoons ) for osmolality and BP-regulating hormones will be collected 30 and 60 minutes after water ( +75 and +105 minutes of study ) . Monitoring will be continued until + 135 min . At 135 minutes , the study will end for the day . The timing of pseudoephedrine administration relative to water ingestion and the duration of the monitoring period are based on previous results3 and pharmacokinetic data7 reporting a Tmax for pseudoephedrine between 1 and 2 hours . Testing on study day 2 will be identical with the participant consuming the alternate water volume . Study Testing days 3 and 4 are optional Arm 3 : Placebo PO + 50 ml water Arm 4 : Placebo PO + 480 ml water Testing will be performed according to the same schedule as for Arms 1 and 2 .

Yale University,NCT02499757,Does Sweet Taste Potentiate Nicotine Cue Reactivity?,Yale University,1,1,Healthy,Device,flavor and sweetener,Basic Science,Double,"The investigators ' aim is to test the prediction that sweet taste perception enhances the ability of nicotine to induce neural plastic changes in brain reward circuits to increase the saliency , liking and brain reactivity to the sight and vaporized flavor of electronic cigarettes ( e-cigarettes ) .","Alternative tobacco products are becoming increasingly available in the US market and are promoted as potentially less deleterious compared to cigarettes . These products are increasing in usage as either a substitution for cigarette smoking or in addition to smoking . One particular appeal is that they often combine nicotine with sweet taste and flavors , which are themselves reinforcing . The primary goal of this project is to determine if sweet taste can potentiate the reinforcing properties of nicotine . Similar to nicotine , cues predicting the availability of carbohydrates can stimulate intake , even in the absence of hunger . The investigators have developed a novel flavor-nutrient conditioning paradigm to study the reinforcing properties of carbohydrates . Novel flavors are paired with 0 or 113 kcal carbohydrate and increases in flavor-cue reactivity ( change in liking and brain response ) when later sampled in the absence of the carbohydrate provide a measure of the reinforcing potency . For smokers , the aroma of tobacco is a potent cue that can promote smoking behavior . Using a modified version of our conditioning paradigm , our specific aim is to test the prediction that sweet taste perception enhances the ability of nicotine to induce neural plastic changes in brain reward circuits to increase the saliency , liking and brain reactivity to the sight and vaporized flavor of electronic cigarettes ( e-cigarettes ) . Participants will smoke e-cigarettes that contain nicotine and an unsweetened vaporized flavor , nicotine and a sweet vaporized flavor or only a sweet vaporized flavor ( no nicotine ) . The investigators predict that response in the nucleus accumbens and hypothalamus to the sight and vaporized flavor of the e-cigarette that was paired with nicotine and sweet taste will be greater than the responses to the sight and vaporized flavors associated with the other e-cigarettes . The investigators further predict that liking and wanting will increase more for the sight and vaporized flavor associated with both nicotine and sweet taste . This finding would provide strong evidence that sweet taste potentiates the reinforcement potency of nicotine and could therefore promote use .",2014-10-24,"March 4, 2020","Inclusion Criteria : right handed non-daily smoker english speaking Exclusion Criteria : serious or unstable medical illness ( e.g. , cancer ) ; past or current history of alcoholism or consistent drug use ; current and history of major psychiatric illness as defined by the DSM-IV criteria including eating disorders , medications that affect alertness ( e.g. , barbiturates , benzodiazepines , chloral hydrate , haloperidol , lithium , carbamazepine , phenytoin , etc . ) and any psychoactive drugs or anti-obesity agents ; history of major head trauma with loss of consciousness ; ongoing pregnancy ; known taste or smell dysfunction ; a diagnosis of diabetes ; any known allergies or sensitivity , including to food , vapors or odors ; pregnant or nursing women , history of metalworking , injury with shrapnel or metal slivers , and major surgery ; history of pacemaker or neurostimulator implantation m ) asthma , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , bronchitis or any other lung disease .",15,0,18 Years,45 Years

"University of California, Los Angeles",NCT02634606,Effects of a Supplement Derived From Palm Oil on Cholesterol Levels in the Blood,"University of California, Los Angeles",3,0,Hypercholesterolemia,Drug,Gamma Delta Tocotrienols - Low Dose,Prevention,Double,"Elevated blood cholesterol , and particularly LDL cholesterol , is a risk factor for heart disease . Tocotrienols are naturally-occurring compounds in foods that may have beneficial effects on blood cholesterol . Tocotrienols are members of the vitamin E family , and are found in barley , oats , rye , coconut oil and rice bran oil , but the richest source of tocotrienols is palm oil . Certain of these tocotrienols have been shown to be effective in lowering LDL ( or 'bad ' ) cholesterol , with no adverse effects on the HDL ( or 'good ' ) cholesterol . The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of a palm-oil derived tocotrienol supplement on blood cholesterol , and particularly LDL cholesterol , in individuals who are taking statins , and have either elevated or normal cholesterol levels . Study subjects will consume a palm-oil derived supplement of tocotrienol for 3 months to determine its effects on LDL cholesterol .","Both tocotrienols and tocopherols , whose derivatives are in eight different isoforms , are closely related structurally . Tocopherols are generally present in common vegetable oils ( i.e . soy , canola ) . However , tocotrienols are concentrated in cereal grains ( ie . oat , barley , and rye , rice bran ) , with the highest level found in crude palm oil . The development of new cholesterol-lowering agents has been given more and more attention by pharmaceutical companies due to the strong relationship between cholesterol and atherosclerosis . Tocotrienols , especially δ- and γ-tocotrienols , were shown to be effective nutritional agents to treat high cholesterol in recent research programs . In particular , γ-tocotrienol appears to inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase at a posttranscriptional level and there is some evidence that tocopherols antagonize this effect . Therefore , the current study is designed to demonstrate that treatment with a tocotrienol-enriched fraction of palm oil for a three month period will lead to a significant reduction in LDL cholesterol with no effect on HDL cholesterol in patients whose cholesterol level is not adequately controlled in spite of statins . This objective will be achieved utilizing a simple three arm randomized placebo-controlled trial in a total of 99 subjects After acclimation to a step I AHA diet and no supplemental vitamin E in the diet , subjects will be given either a placebo capsule or a tocotrienol ( 120mg or 240mg ) capsule in addition to their statin medications",2014-09-26,"January 23, 2019","Inclusion Criteria : Able to read , speak , and understand English Male or female , 35-70 years old ( inclusive ) Total Fasting Plasma Cholesterol of > 180 mg/dl Currently taking statin medications .
