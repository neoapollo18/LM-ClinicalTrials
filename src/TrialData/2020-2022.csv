The reasons of the former are lake of nutrients , bone marrow disorder , low level tropic hormone , inflammation associated with infectious , inflammatory , or malignant disorders and the latter are intravascular hemolysis or blood loss . Anemia is characterized by the sign of pallor ( reduced oxyhemoglobin in skin or mucous membranes ) , fatigue , lightheadedness , and weakness associated with low hemoglobin . Iron deficiency anemia ( IDA ) is mainly resulted from inadequate iron uptake of food , malabsorption of iron and blood loss . Adult female are easy to have IDA compared to male because of menstruation , pregnancy , lactation and low caloric uptake leading to iron deficiency . In Taiwan , cancer-related and chronic kidney disease also lead to insufficient secretion of erythropoietin ( EPO ) . The cost of long-term use EPO and its derivative drugs is high . Besides , drug resistance , risk of tumor growth and cardiovascular disease are all important issues . However , ferrotherapy will induce GI upset , muscle pain and skin hives . Also , iron supplementation can lead to an increase in infectious disease morbidity in areas where bacterial infections or where malaria are common .

University of Washington,NCT04688346,Cardiovascular Effects of Racemic Epinephrine Pellets,University of Washington,2,1,Epinephrine Causing Adverse Effects in Therapeutic Use,Drug,HemeRX epinephrine pellets,Other,,"The primary aim of this study was to determine if topical racemic epinephrine pellets affect heart rate ( HR ) , systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) , diastolic blood pressure ( DBP ) or mean arterial pressure ( MAP ) in children receiving dental care under general anesthesia ( GA ) . Thirteen patients requiring prefabricated zirconia crowns on both primary maxillary first molars were recruited into a split-mouth randomized controlled pilot study . Patients received a continuous infusion of propofol and remifentanil with inhaled nitrous oxide/oxygen . After patient randomization and tooth preparation , either saline pellets ( control ) or racemic epinephrine pellets ( treatment ) were applied directly to gingival tissue . Vital sign measurements were recorded for 5 minutes . The procedure was repeated with either control or treatment on the contralateral side .","Dental caries is the most common chronic disease of childhood . 3-6 % of US children experience early childhood caries , a condition that may necessitate restorative dental treatment . Prefabricated crowns are the treatment of choice for children with rampant caries involving large or multiple surface lesions or developmental defects . In such situations , crowns reinforce the tooth and provide increased durability and longevity over intracoronal restorations such as fillings . They also reduce the chance that the tooth will experience recurrent decay . In routine clinical practice , preformed metal crowns , also known as stainless steel crowns ( SSC ) are frequently indicated due to their extreme durability , relatively low cost , and minimal technique sensitivity . Stainless steel crowns ( SSC ) are no longer the only standard of care in restoring primary teeth . Although SSCs are highly effective , esthetics can be a concern for parents . Prefabricated zirconia crowns provide an esthetic solution . Zirconia is a crystalline dioxide of zirconium that has mechanical properties similar to those of metals while its color is similar to that of teeth . According to a recent randomized controlled trial , both SSC and zirconia crowns proved to be an excellent choice for molar teeth full coverage restorations . However , zirconia crowns performed better from the standpoint of esthetics , gum tissue response and plaque retention . ( Abdulhadi Bashaer S , Abdullah Medhat M , et al . Clinical evaluation between zirconia crowns and stainless steel crowns in primary molars teeth . Journal of pediatric dentistry . 2017 , Vol 5 , issue 1 ; 21-27 . ) Both Stainless steel crown and zirconia crown preparations include removing caries , followed by reducing the height of the tooth by 1.5 mm , reducing the sides of the tooth to make the pre-fabricated crown fit on the tooth . The SSC preparation requires subgingival reduction 1-2 mm below the gumline on anterior and posterior surfaces ( not medial and lateral ) . The only additional preparation step that zirconia crown preparation involves is medial and lateral reduction of the tooth ; therefore , there is little additional time that is needed for preparation of the crown since the only difference is the depth of the side reduction and preparing it circumferentially . In addition , the Primary Investigator ( PI ) is the provider who will be treating all patients . The PI is an experienced pediatric dentist and has been providing both types of crowns to patients under general anesthesia every week for many years . The average time for a dental procedure under general anesthesia is between 1-3 hours . Factors that increase time include extent of disease , number of fillings/crowns placed , and pediatric dentist 's experience . The pediatric dentist that will be doing the surgery on all patients has been practicing for many years and has prepared thousands of SSC and zirconia crowns . Therefore , it is not anticipated that it will require additional time to prepare the zirconia crowns versus stainless steel crowns . Vital signs ( BP and HR ) will be monitored for 4 minutes/tooth , 5-8 minutes total ( See attached chart showing the difference ) . During this time the patient will be continuously anesthetized and under close observation by the attending anesthesiologist . This constitutes a minimal risk to a child 's health . According to studies , epinephrine half-life is about two minutes and once the epinephrine pellet is removed , concentrations will drop by 93.75 % over 4 half-lives which is about 8 minutes . Therefore , if there is any effect on blood pressure it will show immediately and will go back to normal within the time frame that we are recording data . The procedure will be stopped if the blood pressure is at a harmful range to patient . All children will have both of their maxillary primary first molars ( # B , # I ) prepared for prefabricated Zirconia crowns . Teeth that require pulpotomy or pulpectomy treatment will be excluded from the study . In the control group , hemostasis will be achieved by using two pellets soaked with 0.9 % sodium chloride ( physiological saline ) . In the intervention group , hemostasis will be achieved by using two racemic epinephrine HCl pellets ( HemeRX , Racellet # 3 , Sprig Oral Health Technologies , Inc. Loomis , CA ) . Racellet # 3 contains an average of 0.55 mg ( 0.42 to 0.68 mg/pellet ) of racemic epinephrine hydrochloride per pellet . A standard general anesthesia protocol will be used during the study . All monitoring equipment will be applied at this time for the measurement of vital signs throughout the anesthesia . Vital signs will include : respiratory rate , oxygen-saturated hemoglobin percentage , heart rate ( HR ) in beats per minute ( bpm ) and cardiac rhythm , which will be continuously recorded from a 3-lead electrocardiogram ( ECG ) . The systolic blood pressures ( SBP ) and diastolic blood pressures ( DBP ) will be measured in millimeters of mercury ( mmHg ) via ankle artery cuff connected to monitors . Investigators will use a randomization software before the enrollment of the first subject to randomly determine if the right or the left side of the mouth will be the intervention . Once consent is obtained , randomization software will be used again to determine whether the patient will be given control or intervention treatment first . Once patients are under anesthesia and after other dental treatments are completed , the maxillary first primary molars ( # B , # I ) will be prepared for Zirconia crowns . The crowns will be prepared independently . One tooth will be prepared first , the pre-fabricated crown will be tried on to make sure the fit is correct . Next either intervention or control pellets will be placed around the gumline of the tooth and removed after one minute . The vital signs will continue to be recorded for the next 4 minutes meanwhile he crown is being cemented on the tooth . Once that is done the operator will move to the other tooth and repeat the same steps . The process of preparing the tooth for a Zirconia crown requires a circumferential subgingival preparation . Tissue irritation and bleeding is inherent in this process . Once the crown is ready to be permanently cemented hemostasis becomes very important . In both the control and intervention group of teeth , two pellets will be applied directly around the gingival tissue of the prepared tooth and held for one minute with direct pressure and then removed based on the manufacturer 's recommendation . The time of application will be recorded . The adequacy of hemostasis will be determined subjectively by the attending dentist and recorded as `` adequate '' or `` inadequate '' at 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 minutes after placement . Adequate hemostasis is defined as gingival tissue being dry and hemorrhage-free . Inadequate hemostasis is defined as inability to keep the gingival tissue dry and without hemorrhage . If hemostasis is not achieved after four minutes of managing a subject during the study intervention ( saline or epinephrine pellets ) to which a tooth has been randomized , we will revert to the standard of care in order to stop the bleeding . Lidocaine will not be administered as a primary local anesthetic nor would it be used during our study . Only epinephrine pellets and saline pellets will be used in the study for achieving hemostasis . Cardiovascular outcomes of patient 's systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) , diastolic blood pressure ( DBP ) and heart rate ( HR ) will be collected by the graduate researcher during the procedure . The researcher will record the blood pressure/HR before placement of pellets , immediately after placement and at 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 minutes after placement . The pellets will stay on the tissue for 1 minute only and then removed . The researcher will also record hemostasis efficacy as per dental surgeon as either `` adequate '' or `` inadequate '' during the procedure . In addition to the above measurements , cardiac rhythms will be assessed continuously via ECG and recording any arrhythmias . Mean arterial pressure ( MAP ) , the amount of time in surgery and anesthesia medications used for each patient will also be recorded . All patients will be discharged on the same day after adequate recovery observation time .",2020-11-02,"May 12, 2021","Inclusion Criteria : Children ages 2-9 years undergoing general anesthesia for comprehensive dental treatment at the University of Washington Center of Pediatric Dentistry .

Singapore General Hospital,NCT04400929,Using GM-CSF as a Host Directed Therapeutic Against COVID-19,Singapore General Hospital,2,1,COVID,Drug,Sargramostim,Treatment,Double,"The coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID-19 ) has rapidly become a pandemic . COVID-19 poses a mortality risk of 3-7 % , rising to 20 % in older patients with co-morbidities . Of all infected patients , 15-20 % will develop severe respiratory symptoms necessitating hospital admission . Around 5 % of patients will require invasive mechanical ventilation , and up to 50 % will die . Evidence in severe COVID-19 suggests that these patients experience cytokine storm and progressed rapidly with acute respiratory distress syndrome and eventual multi-organ failure . Early identification and immediate treatment of hyperinflammation is thus recommended to reduce mortality . Granulocyte Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor ( GM-CSF ) has been shown to be a myelopoietic growth factor that has pleiotropic effects in promoting the differentiation of immature precursors into polymorphonuclear neutrophils , monocytes/ macrophages and dendritic cells , and also in controlling the function of fully mature myeloid cells . It plays an important role in priming monocytes for production of proinflammatory cytokines under TLR and NLR stimulation . It has a broad impact on the processes driving DC differentiation and affects DC effector function at the mature state . Importantly , GM-CSF plays a critical role in host defense and stimulating antiviral immunity . Detailed studies have also shown that GM-CSF is necessary for the maturation of alveolar macrophages from foetal monocytes and the maintenance of these cells in adulthood . The known toxicology , pharmacologic and safety data also support the use of Leukine® in hypoxic respiratory failure and ARDS due to COVID-19 . This study aims to recruit patients with evidence of pneumonia and hypoxia who have increased risk for severe disease and need for mechanical ventilation . The overall hypothesis is that GM-CSF has antiviral immunity , can provide the stimulus to restore immune homeostasis in the lung with acute lung injury from COVID-19 , and can promote lung repair mechanisms , which would lead to improvement in lung oxygenation parameters .","The hypothesis of the proposed intervention is that GM-CSF has profound effects on antiviral immunity , can provide the stimulus to restore immune homeostasis in the lung with acute lung injury post COVID-19 , and can promote lung repair mechanisms , which would lead to an improvement in lung oxygenation parameters . This hypothesis is based on experiments performed in mice showing that GM-CSF treatment can prevent mortality and prevent ARDS in mice with post-viral acute lung injury . In the interim analysis of the SARPAC trial , patients who received nebulised Leukine® via a mesh inhaler showed a trend in improvement in their P ( A-a ) O2 gradient at day 6 compared to the SOC group . There are however , anticipated logistical difficulties of training and infection control concerns with administering of nebulised Leukine® via a specialised inhaler in the negative pressure room . Hence we propose to randomize patients with confirmed COVID-19 and acute hypoxic respiratory failure ( saturation < 94 % on room air or PaO2/FiO2 < 350 ) to receive iv Leukine® 125mcg/m2 once a day for 5 days on top of SOC ( treatment group A ) , or to receive SOC treatment only ( placebo group B ) . Dosing of systemic Leukine® is based on prior experience of using this drug in patients with pneumonia-associated ARDS . To measure the effectiveness of Leukine® in restoring lung homeostasis , the primary endpoint of this intervention is measuring oxygenation after 5 days of intravenous treatment through assessment of pre-treatment and post-treatment ratio of PaO2/FiO2 , and through measurement of the P ( A-a ) O2 gradient , which can easily be performed in the setting of clinical observation of inpatients . During the 5-day treatment period , we will perform daily measurements of oxygen saturation ( pulse oximetry ) in relation to FiO2 , and the slope of alterations in these parameters could also be an indicator that our hypothesis is correct . Comparison will be between group A receiving iv Leukine® on top of standard of care ( SOC ) and placebo group B receiving SOC only . Data from the Wuhan COVID-19 epidemic show that patients that deteriorate are facing a prolonged period of mechanical ventilation . Therefore , the study will be unblinded at day 5 , or at any time within the first 5 days of study should the patient deteriorate clinically with need for supplemental oxygen FiO2 requirement ≥ 0.5 . Patients in group B will then have the option to receive 5 days of iv Leukine® , based on the treating physician 's assessment . This group will be group D. Patients who require mechanical ventilation also have the option to receive an additional 5 days of iv Leukine® , based on the treating physician 's assessment ( group C and E ) . A total of 30 patients with confirmed COVID-19 and acute hypoxic respiratory failure will be enrolled , 15 who will receive Leukine® + SOC , and 15 who will receive placebo + SOC . The target group of subjects is defined as confirmed COVID-19 patients with acute hypoxic respiratory failure admitted to the COVID-19 isolation ward . Subjects will be recruited from the isolation wards located in Singapore General Hospital ( SGH ) . Subjects will be identified by the primary managing physicians who are infectious diseases physicians . Safety data , including blood leukocyte counts , will be collected in all patients . Efficacy data will also be collected and will include arterial blood gases , oxygenation parameters , need for ventilation , lung compliance , organ function , radiographic changes , ferritin levels , triglyceride levels , etc . as well as occurrence of secondary bacterial infections .

This Randomized Clinical Trial seeks to evaluate whether Rituximab biosimilar maintains drug-free disease remission in patientswith steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome for 12-24 months and verify its superiority vs. mycophenolate mofetil , the reference standard therapy . The investigators will compare the risk of relapse to test this hypothesis ( primary outcome ) . Secondary objectives will include assessing short- and long-term side-effects and developing specific biomarkers of sensitivity to therapy . Patients will be recruited , treated and followed at IRCCS G Gaslini and IRCCS Bambino Gesù where laboratory studies will be performed at in-site facilities","Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome ( NS ) is characterized by proteinuria and hypoalbuminemia associated with dyslipidemia and hypercoagulability . Oral corticosteroids are the cornerstone of therapy and induce disease remission in approximately 90 % of cases . However , up to 85 % of patients relapse and many develop steroid dependence ( SDNS ) , requiring prolonged dose of steroids to maintain remission . Clinical practice guidelines ( KDIGO ) suggest using low-dose prednisone to maintain remission in SDNS and Mycophenolate Mofetil ( MMF ) or calcineurin inhibitors ( CNI ) as corticosteroid-sparing agents for children who develop steroid adverse effects . Given the toxicity of all these drugs ( steroids , CNI and MMF ) , there is a need to investigate alternative options . Recent evidence supports the use of chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies in simple SDNS ( Rituximab , RTX ) . The RTX4 trial is an open-label , two-parallel-arm , controlled and randomized clinical trial testing the superiority of RTX over MMF in maintaining steroid free disease remission in patients with SDNS . Eligible participants are children and young adults ( age between 3 and 24 years ) with nephrotic syndrome who are dependent on prednisone 0.3-1mg/Kg/day and have received prednisone for at least six months before enrolment . Previous treatment with MMF will be allowed . All participants will enter a 45 days run-in period , during which children treated with steroids alone will start MMF 1,200 mg/1,73 sqm orally in 2 daily doses and will taper steroids after 15 days by 0.3 mg/kg per week until complete withdrawal . Patients already receiving MMF alone will continue the treatment . During the same period , instruction on urine collection and dipstick readings will be carefully reviewed and compliance assessed . After run-in period , children will be randomized to either the intervention arm ( Rituximab , 375mg/m2 ) or the comparator arm ( continuing or starting MMF ) . In the intervention arm , 1 month after infusion MMF will be decreased by 50 % and withdrawn within 2 additional weeks , whereas MMF will be maintained in the comparator . All patients will be followed for up to 24 months . In case of relapses during this period ( see outcome section for definition ) patients will be treated with oral prednisone ( 60 mg/sqm day ) . Following remission , steroids will be maintained at the initial dose for 7 days and then tapered off by 0.3 mg/kg per week until complete withdrawal in patients of the MMF arm . Patients of the intervention arm will instead be treated with another infusion of RTX ( same dose ) immediately following steroid-induced remission . After infusion of RTX , steroids will be maintained at the initial dose for 7 days and then tapered off by 0.3 mg/kg per week until complete withdrawal . In this way relapsed patients in both arms will receive the same cumulative dose of prednisone . In case following relapse of proteinuria patients fail to respond to prednisone ( they will terminate the study and be considered as treatment failure ) . The study allows drop-in from one arm to the other after 3 relapses ( i.e. , investigators will be allowed to use RTX in the comparator arm and vice versa MMF in intervention arm ) . The economic balance will be calculated on the basis of RTX doses needed to maintain remittance . All patients will be followed for 24 months . In person visits will occure at enrollment , at T0 ( infusion ) , after 1 month and every 3/6 months later .

Part 1 will be an open-label , 4-sequence , escalating repeat-application study comprised of up to 4 cohorts ( 3 subjects per cohort , with 3 up to 6 in Cohort 4 , or the final Part 1 cohort ) . In each cohort , subjects will be given topical VT30 for a 4-week Treatment Period . Subjects will begin treatment with the designated dose on Day 1 . After 2 weeks , the Investigator will examine the treated surface area and determine if the formulation is tolerated such that the subject may apply the next dose strength of VT30 gel for the remaining duration of the Treatment Period . Specifically , the following gel dose strengths ( concentrations ) are planned for Cohorts 1 through 3 in Part 1 : Cohort 1 : initiate dosing with 0.12 % ( w/w ) gel and progress to 0.6 % ( w/w ) gel for the final 2 weeks of the Part 1 Treatment Period ( if the lower dose is tolerated ) Cohort 2 : initiate dosing with 0.6 % ( w/w ) gel and progress to 1.2 % ( w/w ) gel for the final 2 weeks of the Part 1 Treatment Period ( if the lower dose is tolerated ) Cohort 3 : initiate dosing with 1.2 % ( w/w ) gel and progress to 2.3 % ( w/w ) gel for the final 2 weeks of the Part 1 Treatment Period ( if the lower dose is tolerated ) A Safety Review Committee ( SRC ) , with sponsor , investigator and independent medical representation , will provide oversight and guidance for study conduct . After 3 subjects have been dosed for at least 21 days in any of the first three Part 1 cohorts , the SRC may request additional data , approve initiation of the subsequent cohort , or mandate that additional subjects to be enrolled at either the higher or lower dose within the cohort . After 9 subjects in Cohorts 1 through 3 ( 3 subjects per cohort ) have completed the 4-week Treatment Period , the SRC will determine if additional subjects should be assigned to Cohort 4 ( or the final Part 1 cohort ) to receive the MTD ( maximum tolerated dose ) or MFD ( maximum feasible dose ) strength of VT30 . Subjects in Cohort 4 will receive the designated dose strength and regimen of VT30 for a full 4 weeks . Following the completion of Cohort 4 in Part 1 , the SRC will determine whether to authorize initiation of Part 2 and will confirm the dose level and regimen to be administered in Part 2 . Part 2 will be a randomized , placebo-controlled , double-blind study containing 36 subjects assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive either VT30 or placebo . Up to 12 subjects who complete Part 1 may enroll in Part 2 , provided they meet all Part 2-specific inclusion criteria with no applicable exclusions . After the first 12 subjects in Part 2 have completed 4 weeks of treatment , the SRC will conduct a review of blinded safety data to confirm no revisions or changes are needed to the protocol . Subsequent reviews may also be conducted to ensure continued acceptable safety and tolerability . After subjects complete their designated Treatment Period ( in Part 1 or Part 2 ) , they will participate in a 4-week post treatment Follow-up Period .",2020-05-11,"August 1, 2022","Inclusion Criteria : Have signed the current approved informed consent form Have a clinically or phenotypically defined VM , LM , or mixed VLM affecting the skin Lesion genotyping confirms either PIK3CA or TEK mutations , known to be pathogenic Agrees to use contraception if of childbearing potential Be willing and able to comply with the protocol and be available for the entire study Be at least 18 to 60 years of age Lesion must be amenable to defining a contiguous study treatment area of 140 cm2 Exclusion Criteria : Lesion to be treated is on the face or involves mucosa Presence of ulcerations on the target-treatment lesion Known systemic hypersensitivity to the VT30 drug substance , its inactive ingredients , or the vehicle Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus Hyperlipidemia that is poorly controlled on current treatment Pregnant or nursing , planning to become pregnant , or planning to father a child during the study History of malignancy except successfully treated nonmetastatic cutaneous squamous cell or basal cell carcinoma and/or localized carcinoma in situ of the cervix Major surgery within 8 weeks of Screening , or a surgical , laser or other procedure involving the target lesion within 8 weeks of Screening , or planned to occur during the study Any other medical or personal condition that , in the opinion of the Investigator , may potentially compromise the safety or compliance of the subject , or may preclude the subject 's successful completion of the clinical study Medically significant infection ( eg , cellulitis or abscess , or a systemic infection ) within 8 weeks of Screening Ongoing therapy with another topical treatment or any medication that inhibits PI3K , Akt pathway , or the mTOR pathway , or in the opinion of the Investigator , the subject requires systemic therapy for their vascular malformation condition Use of a biologic or systemic immunosuppressive agent within 3 months of Screening Systemic use of corticosteroids , within 30 days of Screening Treatment with a small molecule investigational product within 30 days of Screening , or with any investigational biologic products within 3 months of Screening Positive for hepatitis C antibody , hepatitis B surface antigen , hepatitis B core antibody , or human immunodeficiency virus Alanine transaminase or aspartate transaminase laboratory values in excess of 1.5X the upper limit of normal at Screening Hemoglobin A1c is > 8 % Any other clinically significant laboratory or testing abnormality that , in the opinion of the Investigator , might confound the study , interfere with the subject 's ability to complete the study , or represent a meaningful safety risk upon study enrollment",15,0,18 Years,60 Years

Sodium Cromoglycate ( SCG ) has a very nice safety profile but is less effective when compared to inhaled corticosteroids in asthma patients . However , SCG has been shown to be especially effective in exercise-induced asthma and to reduce metabolite secretion in athletes due to hyperpnoea . Although commercial interest in the drug has fainted , from a clinical point of view , it remains the ideal candidate to be used in adolescents with features of EIB at risk to develop asthma in whom today no treatment would be initiated . This clinical trial ( s63147 ) , which is WP3 of the FWO-TBM project , is a randomized double-blinded trial with subjects who tested positive for the diagnosis of EIB in either WP1 or WP2 .

Universidad Central de Venezuela,NCT04545307,Transplantation of Allogeneic MSC in Patients With Pulp Necrosis and Chronic Apical Periodontitis,Universidad Central de Venezuela,2,1,Pulp Necroses,Biological,Allogenic transplant of BM-MSC in a root canal from patients with immature apexes and pulpar necrosis and apical periodontitis,Treatment,,"The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effect of Mesenchymal Stromal Cell ( MSC ) implantation on pulp and periapical regeneration of immature teeth with pulp necrosis and chronic apical periodontitis . BACKGROUND : Post-traumatic pulp necrosis prevents root development in children and adolescents . The multipotent ability of MSC to differentiate into bone-forming cells ( osteoblasts ) and dentin-forming cells ( Odontoblast ) has allowed the development of protocols to induce dental pulp regeneration in preclinical models and patients with immature teeth with pulpal necrosis . IMPACT : Worldwide , post-traumatic pulp necrosis in children and adolescents constitutes a health problem in the endodontic area . Treatment with MSC would provide an effective therapeutic alternative to patients with pulp necrosis and incomplete root formation . The possible pulp and periapical regeneration of immature teeth induced by MSC would have a huge impact on the treatment of these patients . Eligibility for EMC implant study Age : 6 to 16 years Sex : Male or Female Healthy volunteers accepted : NO . TREATMENT GROUPS : In the present study , the implantation of MSC will be performed in patients with immature teeth with pulpal necrosis with apical periodontitis , who will receive the appropriate endodontic treatment ( according to the guidelines of the American Association of Endodontics ) and implantation of allogeneic BM-MSC . This group will be compared with the history made in the Postgraduate Endodontics of the Universidad Central de Venezuela ( UCV ) and with international case series made by revascularization . Clinical follow-up of each patient : Clinical controls ( facial evaluation , gingival evaluation , apical palpation , horizontal and vertical percussion , cold and heat sensitivity tests ) will be carried out on days 0 , 7 , 30 , 90 , 180 and 364 . Additionally , a clinical evaluation will be carried out at the two years post-implantation of MSC . Radiological controls will be carried out on days 0 , 7 , 30 , 90 , 180 and 364 . Additionally , they will be carried out two years post-implantation of MSC . A tomographic evaluation will be performed when was evident periapical repair in a periapical radiograph . To measure root formation , root canal narrowing and verification the periapical repair in 3D .","The endodontic procedure in the patients included in this study will focus on cases of pulp necrosis with apical periodontitis without evidence of infectious processes . MATERIALS AND METHODS . Reagents Murine monoclonal antibodies , directed against human differentiation antigens ( CD34 , CD45 , CD14 , CD90 , CD73 , CD29 , CD49b , CD166 ) , conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate ( CFI ) or phycoerythrin ( PE ) were purchased from BD Biosciences ( USA ) . Isolation and culture of mesenchymal stromal cells ( MSC ) obtained from human bone marrow . In the present study , isolated EMFs from bone marrow ( BM ) from patients with a diagnosis of post-traumatic nonunion ( failure of a bone union at fracture sites ) will be used . These cells were transplanted into the pseudoarthrosis site to induce bone regeneration in these patients . The protocol for bone regeneration through EMF transplantation was carried out at the University Hospital of Caracas , Hospital Universitario de Los Andes , Hospital Pérez de León II and has the approval of the Bioethics Committees of each institution and each patient through informed consent . In this protocol , the BM of each patient was isolated by a puncture in the iliac crest . This procedure was performed in the operating room , under anesthesia and by a medical specialist . The MO aspirate was placed in alpha-MEM medium ( Invitrogen , USA ) with heparin ( Sanofi Aventis ) . The mononuclear cells were separated by centrifugation on a Ficoll-Hypaque gradient ( GE Healthcare , Sweden ) and cultured in alpha-MEM-Chang medium ( Irvine Scientific , USA ) enriched with 20 % autologous serum . These cells were kept in culture in a controlled environment at 37ºC and 5 % CO2 . After 72 hours , non-adherent cells were eliminated , and a basal culture medium ( alpha-MEM-Chang / 20 % autologous serum ) was added . Their adherence to the plastic isolated the MSCs . Culture medium exchanges were made until reaching a confluence close to 70-80 % . The MSCs were expanded by pealing the cultures , following the process described above . Microbiological examinations were performed after obtaining the BM and before performing the MSC implantation . After using MSC , a batch of these cells were cryopreserved at -70 -C. Phenotypic characterization of MSC . Phenotypic characterization studies of MSC were carried out by flow cytometry . For which the MO adherent cells were detached from the culture flask by using trypsin-like enzymes . Subsequently , the cells were incubated with antibodies specific for MSC markers ( CD90 , CD73 , CD105 , CD29 , CD166 and CD49b ) and hematopoietic ( CD34 , CD45 and CD14 ) . Cytometric analysis of the expression markers showed that 100 % of the cells used for transplantation in each patient were MSC . MSC differentiation studies . The multipotential differentiation capacity of MSCs was examined by culturing these cells in osteogenic , chondrogenic and adipogenic differentiation media , following a methodology similar to that previously described . Briefly , the MSCs were detached and seeded in 24-well culture plates at a cell density of 5x104 per well , proceeding to add the corresponding differentiation medium . For osteogenic differentiation , MSCs were cultured in the presence of basal medium enriched with dexamethasone ( 100nM , Biotech ) , ascorbic acid ( 10mM , Sigma ) , inorganic phosphate ( 1.8mM , Merck ) and beta-glycerol phosphate ( 2mM , Sigma ) . For chondrogenic differentiation , cells were cultured in a commercial medium for chondrocytes ( Cell Application , USA ) and for differentiation towards the adipogenic lineage the commercial medium NH Adipodiff Human ( Miltenyi , USA ) was used . In all cases , the cells were kept in culture for 21-28 days with medium changes every 4-5 days . To demonstrate the changes associated with the differentiation process , the cells were fixed using paraformaldehyde ( Merck , USA ) and specific stains were performed for each case . Briefly , alizarin red to detect calcium deposition ( evidence of osteogenesis ) , Alcian blue to detect proteoglycans ( evidence of chondrogenesis ) , and oil red ( Oil Red ) to see lipids ( evidence of adipogenesis ) . In all cases , microscopic observation and photographic registration were carried out . For endothelial differentiation ( CEn ) , EMFs were cultured in MCDB 131 medium ( Invitrogen , USA ) enriched with 10 % autologous serum , 10µg / ml of human epidermal growth factor ( hu-EGF , R & D ) and hydrocortisone ( 1µg / ml , Sigma ) . MSC implantation in patients with pulp necrosis and apical periodontitis . All MSC processing procedures will be carried out in the cleanroom of the IVIC Cell Therapy Unit following the standards of good manufacturing practice ( GMP ) . Allogeneic BM-MSC from patients diagnosed with post-traumatic nonunion and treated with implantation of these cells will be used to induce bone regeneration . The MSC to be used in this protocol have previously been phenotypically and functionally characterized . The MSC will be thawed , grown and expanded as previously described . A part of the cells will be kept in a medium for MSCs , and another part will be cultured in endothelial differentiation medium ( CEM-Endo ) . Once the required number of MSCs and MSCs-Endo have been reached , a suspension of these cells ( 75,000 cells from each of them ) will be placed in sterile culture tubes containing DMEM-F12 culture medium , without phenol red , supplemented with 20 % autologous serum . Each tube containing MSC / MSC-Endo will be transported in a small biological sample transport cellar , at room temperature , to the Dentistry Service of the Instituto Venezolano de Investigaciones Científicas ( IVIC ) . Under sterile conditions , the patient will be locally anesthetized in the affected tooth area ; the root canal of the affected tooth will be exposed and prepared to perform the MSC / MSC-Endo / PRP implant . At the same time , the culture medium supernatant is removed from each tube and the CEM / CEM-Endo `` button ( pellet ) '' is resuspended in autologous platelet-rich plasma ( PRP ) . Subsequently to the MSC / Endo / PRP suspension , 5 % CaCl2 and thrombin will be added . Immediately , and before the clot forms , 20 microliters of the CEM / CEM-Endo / PRP suspension will be placed in the root canal , covered with a collagen membrane .

Severe pneumonia associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) is the most threatening and feared complication of COVID-19 infection , with mortality rates close to 50 % in some groups . Autopsies between these severe cases reveal severe capillary involvement , with signs of intense inflammatory changes , microvascular thrombosis , endothelial injury and abnormal tissue repair . The available evidence suggests that abnormal activation or imbalance in the counter-regulation of the kallikrein-kinin system may play a central role in a positive feedback cycle , leading to consequent diffuse microangiopathy . Blockade of the kallikrein-kinin system can therefore prevent deterioration of lung function by reducing inflammation , edema and microthrombosis .

Universiteit Antwerpen,NCT04544787,A Phase 2 Study to Evaluate the Safety and Immunogenicity of Two Oral Poliovirus Vaccine Candidates,Pierre Van Damme,2,1,Poliomyelitis,Biological,Novel OPV2 candidate 1,Prevention,Quadruple,This study is designed to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of two novel type 2 oral poliovirus vaccine ( nOPV2 ) candidates ( nOPV2 candidate 1 and nOPV2 candidate 2 ) in adults . The primary objectives of the study include the general safety and immunogenicity of the two candidate vaccines in healthy volunteers previously vaccinated with Sabin monovalent OPV or inactivated polio vaccine ( IPV ) only .,"Two nOPV2 vaccine candidates have been developed as attenuated serotype 2 polioviruses derived from a modified Sabin 2 infectious complementary deoxyribonucleic acid ( cDNA ) clone . nOPV2 Candidate 1 ( S2/cre5/S15domV/rec1/hifi3 ) and nOPV2 Candidate 2 ( S2/S15domV/CpG40 ) were generated by modifying the Sabin-2 ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) sequence to improve phenotypic stability and make the strains less prone to reversion to virulence . The novel vaccine will eventually be licensed based on 3 criteria : a similar safety profile to the currently licensed monovalent OPV2 ( mOPV2 ) of the Sabin strain , non-inferior immunogenicity , and reduced reversion to virulence . Due to the withdrawal of Sabin monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 and prohibition of its use from April 2016 onward , well before the availability of nOPV2 for clinical testing , a head to head comparison of nOPV2 and mOPV2 is not possible . For these reasons , Phase 4 trials have been conducted with Sabin mOPV2 to provide control data on safety , immunogenicity , against which data for nOPV2 in subsequent Phase I and II studies will be evaluated and compared . The Phase 4 trials of Sabin mOPV2 were designed to parallel the expected design of the Phase 1 and 2 nOPV2 studies with respect to overall design , inclusion of similar study cohorts . This study is designed to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of two novel type 2 OPV candidates in adults before testing in young children and then infants . The study will include both OPV-vaccinated and IPV-vaccinated adults to provide safety and immunogenicity data relevant to the decision to advance to future studies with testing in children who have not been exposed to OPV2 . The primary objectives of the study include the general safety and immunogenicity of the two candidate vaccines , primarily based on comparison with historical data obtained in a Phase 4 study of Sabin mOPV2 for OPV-vaccinated subjects , in order to establish non-inferior immunogenicity and acceptable safety profile . Assessment of the general safety of the 2 candidate vaccines in IPV-only vaccinated participants will be based on comparison with data from a placebo group . The phase 4 control study ( UAM1 ) used for the comparison in this study is registered with EudraCT ( 2015-003325-33 ) . Participants were healthy adults aged 18-50 years with documented history of at least three polio vaccinations , including OPV , and were randomly assigned to either one dose or two doses of monovalent OPV2 .

Mechanistically , tolerogenic fibroblasts produce anti-inflammatory and immune modulatory factors , which appear to be therapeutic in the context of autoimmunity , including IL-10 and TGF-beta . Additionally , tolerogenic fibroblasts produce neurotrophic mediators that enhance myelin production and/or prevent neuronal apoptosis . This study will assess primary safety and secondary efficacy endpoints of intravenous administration of 100 million tolerogenic fibroblasts to 5 patients with relapsing remitting MS resistant to interferon .

Research Hypothesis : Intravenous administration of 100 million tolerogenic fibroblasts will be well tolerated and induce a therapeutic effect in relapse remitting MS patients . Rationale : The family of Mesenchymal Stem Cells ( MSCs ) is immune-modulatory , and bone marrow MSCs ( BM-MSCs ) have induced therapeutic responses in patients with MS [ 1 ] . Tolerogenic fibroblasts possess superior immune modulatory activity compared to BM-MSCs and adipose MSCs .

Rehman Medical Institute - RMI,NCT05348980,Intramuscular Phenylephrine HCL for Prevention of Spinal Anesthesia Induced Hypotension,Rehman Medical Institute - RMI,4,1,Hypotension,Drug,Phenylephrine Hydrochloride 4 mg,Prevention,Triple,"Background : Spinal anesthesia ( SA ) is preferred over general anesthesia in Cesarean section ( CS ) due to its better safety profile but SA induced hypotension remains a big challenge for the clinical Anesthetist . Different methods including 15° left lateral table tilt , leftward uterine manual displacement , fluid pre-and co-loading have been used but drop in Systolic Blood Pressure ( SBP ) jeopardizing maternal and fetal well-being still occurs . Timely administered Phenylephrine HCL , an α-1 adrenergic agonist , is a recommended remedy . Subjects and methods : Sixty parturients of American Society of Anaesthesiologists ( ASA ) physical status 1 and 2 , scheduled for elective CS under SA were enrolled in this prospective double-blinded study and randomly divided into two equal groups , P4 and P8 . They received intramuscular ( IM ) Phenylephrine HCL 04 mg and 08 mg respectively before SA . Spinal block up to T6 was achieved with 12.5 mg 0.5 % Bupivacaine HCl heavy . The incidence and intensity of hypotension , rescue doses of Phenylephrine HCL and any adverse event , were recorded . Data collected was analyzed using Epi lnfo ™ version 7.2 .","Introduction : World Health Organization ( WHO ) defines maternal death as a death while pregnant or within 42 days of the end of gestation , from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management ( excluding accidental or incidental causes ) . In 2017 global Maternal Mortality Ratio ( MMR ) reported by United Nations ( UN ) is 211 deaths per 100,000 live births . MMR in Pakistan , with inter-provincial variability , is 186 deaths per 100,000 live births according to the latest Pakistan Maternal Mortality Survey ( PMMS ) report published in August , 2020 by United Nations Population Fund ( UNFPA ) , a subsidiary organ of United Nations General Assembly . CS requires general anesthesia , SA or epidural anesthesia ; however , SA is preferred . SA is believed to be safe , though severe complications like profound hypotension compounded by aorto-caval compression might happen . World Health Organization ( WHO ) defines ideal CS rate below 10 to 15 % . According to 1990-91 and 2017-18 Pakistan Demographic and Health Survey data , rate of C-section has been raised from 3.2 % to 19.6 - 22.3 % . Higher rate of anesthesia and surgery in a developing country like Pakistan has a direct bearing on MMR , patient 's morbidity , cost of medical services and siphoning scarce resources . The first case of cardiac arrest occurring after SA was reported in 1940 and since then , the ability of SA to cause cardio-pulmonary arrest was considered . Hypotension and bradycardia are the most common side effects of SA . SA induced hypotension , which is a substantial clinical challenge , is caused by pharmacological sympathectomy . The incidence is reported around 80 % . Hypotension occurs despite fluid preload , left lateral uterine displacement and left lateral table tilt . Duration and severity of hypotension is responsible for maternal ill effects like nausea/vomiting initially and later culminating to dyspnoea , apnea and circulatory arrest if poorly managed . Additionally there will be poor apgar score or even fetal demise depending upon the severity . Energetic use of strong vasopressors has been recommended . Phenylephrine HCL is considered to be the vasopressor of choice in parturients due to its propensity to cause less fetal acidosis . Phenylephrine HCL being an α-1adrenergic agonist counters the decrease in Systemic Vascular Resistance ( SVR ) induced by SA and can be administered by subcutaneous , intravenous and IM routes . Its onset and duration of action are 1-3 minutes and 5- 20 minutes respectively , when given intravenously ( IV ) ; and 10-20 minutes and an hour respectively when given IM . Clinically , 50-100 microgram boluses of Phenylephrine HCL is used intravenously to address hypotension . The investigators , in the current study exploited its lesser reported IM route . Rationale : IM Phenylephrine HCL shortly before administering SA can prove a better option to prevent hypotension even for longer duration due to its slower absorption and can provide longer hemodynamic stability , lesser drop in fetal pH and apgar score . Objectives : The primary objective of the study was to determine appropriate dose of IM Phenylephrine HCL in preventing hypotension due to SA administered for CS in ASA 1 and 2 parturients . Secondary objectives were to determine the need for total rescue doses of Phenylephrine HCL , measure drop in SBP in the two trial groups ; and observe any side effects associated with IM injection of Phenylephrine HCL .",2022-04-04,"April 21, 2022","Inclusion Criteria : All pregnant ladies of American Society of Anesthesiologists ( ASA ) physical status 1 or 2 with Singleton Pregnancy , Full term pregnancy , and Admitted for elective CS Exclusion Criteria : All those participants having ; Blood pressure ≥140/90 mm of Hg , ASA 3 or above status , Contraindication to spinal anesthesia Fetal anomalies/ Abnormal placentae Refusal to consent",60,1,18 Years,45 Years

BS-COPD patients have a greater risk of exacerbations in comparison to the emphysema phenotype . Therefore , individualizing treatment in both phenotypes may be very useful among the clinical practitioners . The investigators expect treatment with FF/V to be superior in preventing COPD exacerbations than the U/V combination in patients with COPD-asthma phenotype ; andU/V to be superior than FF/V in patients with the emphysema phenotype . The general objective of the study is to determine the exacerbations outcome in patients with COPD-asthma vs emphysema phenotype patients , treated with both drugs .

Background : COPD associated to biomass smoke ( BS-COPD ) represents the third of all COPD cases in Latin America , and almost the 2 % in general population prevalence studies . BS-COPD clinical spectrum is different to the one seen in COPD associated to tobacco smoke ( TS-COPD ) . While BS-COPD patients present COPD-asthma phenotype or asthma-COPD overlap syndrome ( ACOS ) , TS-COPD patients present mostly the emphysema phenotype . COPD-asthma phenotype in BS-COPD , probably explains that they have a greater risk of exacerbations in comparison to the emphysema phenotype . Therefore , individualizing treatment in both phenotypes may be very useful among the clinical practitioners , because even though those patients are not included in traditional clinical trials , they are part of every day 's practice . In this sense , providing a specific treatment in this group of patients could change the disease progression , improving symptoms , quality of life , reducing costs , side effects and exacerbations . The investigators hypothesize that COPD-asthma phenotype or asthma-COPD overlap syndrome ( ACOS ) , may get a greater benefit by using a combination LABA/ICS ( Fluticasone Furoate/Vilanterol - FF/V ) therapy , whereas those with the emphysema phenotype with LABA/LAMA ( Umeclidinium/Vilanterol U/V ) therapy The upside of these drugs is that both of them have the same easy-to-use device , and it is inhaled once a day only . Their efficacy and safety have been tested in TS_COPD but not in BS-COPD . This trial will allow us to have a clinically and functionally characterization ( using biological markers ) of the BS-COPD phenotype and to compare those patients with those with the emphysema phenotype . Hypothesis : Treatment with FF/V will be superior in preventing COPD exacerbations than the U/V combination in patients with COPD-asthma phenotype ; while U/V will be superior than FF/V in patients with the emphysema phenotype . General objective : To determine the exacerbations outcome ( exacerbations free interval , exacerbations frequency , severe exacerbations that needed hospitalization frequency , exacerbations frequency according to absolute and percentage ( > 3 % ) blood eosinophils , exacerbations percentage for emphysema phenotype and COPD-asthma phenotype ) in patients with COPD-asthma vs emphysema phenotype patients , treated with Fluticasone Furoate/Vilanterol 100/25 mcg/day vs Umeclidinium/Vilanterol 55/25 mcg/day , after 6 months of treatment . Secondary objectives : To determine in both groups : ( 1 ) Pulmonary function change ( FEV1 , FVC and inspiratory capacity ) ( 2 ) Impulse oscillometry resistance change ( 3 ) FeNO change ( 5 ) Quality of life change ( CAT and Saint George ) ( 6 ) Dyspnea change ( mMRC , BDI y TDI ) ( 7 ) Functional capacity change ( 6MWT distance ) . ( 8 ) To characterize and establish the frequency of the COPD-asthma phenotype in BS-COPD patients and emphysema-phenotype in TS-COPD patients . Methods : Randomized double blind controlled clinical trial . Patients with at least one exacerbation in the last 12 months ( confirmed by the prescription of antibiotic and/or oral steroid ) , and a smoking index > 10 packs/year or a biomass smoke exposition index > 100 hours/year . One hundred BS-COPD patients and one hundred TS-COPD patients will be included ; both groups will be exposed to the two treatment options . Fifty patients from each group ( BS-COPD and TS-COPD ) will be assigned with FF/V and 50 from each group with U/V . Emphysema phenotype and air-trapping pattern will be determined with a CT image . All CTs will be assessed by a radiologist . Baseline DLco will also be correlated with the emphysema CT findings . Blood eosinophils , blood levels IgE , bronchodilator reversibility and baseline FeNO . Rate of exacerbations will be determined in both groups for a time period of 6 months . At the end of the study , the phenotype of each patient will be determined and treatment efficacy will be evaluated according to the phenotype . The sample size was chosen conventionally by considering that there are no other centers with a BS-COPD cohort . Treatment will be randomly assigned using a random numbers table . Safety evaluation includes severe adverse events ( SAE ) assessment ( mainly pneumonia ) . During the informed consent signing visit ( day -15 ) , BS-COPD or TS-COPD diagnosis will be confirmed . There will be four in-clinic visits ( baseline ; +30 days ; +90 days and +180 days ) where the symptoms diary will be evaluated to determine the rate of exacerbations or other health resources use . Also , pulmonary function tests ( spirometry pre and post-BD , IC ) and functional capacity tests ( 6MWT ) will be performed by each patient . Health related quality of life ( SGRQ and CAT ) and dyspnea ( mMRC and BDI/TDI ) questionnaires will also performed .

The major thermoregulatory defences in humans are sweating , arteriovenous shunt vasoconstriction , and shivering . Inadvertent hypothermia often complicates prolonged surgery . In patients becoming sufficiently hypothermic , reemergence of thermoregulatory vasoconstriction usually prevents further core hypothermia . The extent to which anesthetics reduce the vasoconstriction threshold depends on the type of drug and its concentration .","When propofol induces anesthesia , blood pressure decreases due to vasodilation , which is due to direct action on vascular smooth muscle and vasodilation due to blockage of the sympathetic nervous system . This results in a redistribution of body temperature , resulting in hypothermia . The effects of remimazolam on the central nervous system , respiratory and cardiovascular system have been studied . Remimazolam , a new type of benzodiazepine drug acts on the GABA-A receptor and has the advantages of rapid induction , rapid recovery , stable hemodynamics , and mild respiratory inhibition . At present , there is little literature on its practice in intraoperative thermoregulation under general anesthesia . Investigators hypothesized that the type of anesthetic agents might affect thermoregulatory mechanisms such as the redistribution of body heat , cutaneous heat loss or inhibition of thermoregulatory vasoconstriction .

Promising results of oral zinc gluconate in improving acne vulgaris has been described . A randomized , double blind , placebo-controlled clinical trial was utilized for this study with the objective to assess the efficacy of oral zinc gluconate in the improvement of disease activity in acne vulgaris patients as measured by the inflammatory score and Global Acne Grading System ( GAGS ) score .","Acne has four main pathogenic contributors : follicular hyperkeratinization , increased sebum production , Propionibacterium acnes ( P. acnes ) within the follicle , and inflammation . Treatment options for acne vulgaris include benzoyl peroxide , topical and oral retinoids , topical and oral antimicrobials , oral corticosteroids , and physical modalities such as acne surgery , laser and light therapy . Reports show that antibiotic resistance is a growing issue in the treatment regimen of acne vulgaris , making it less and less suitable for long-term treatment , hence other options that can be substitutes or adjuncts to treatment may be useful in this condition . For long-term or maintenance therapy , physicians should consider effectivity , cost , and adverse effects . Several studies have explored the effect of oral zinc on acne vulgaris . Since zinc is more cost-effective and has less adverse effects compared to most antibiotics , this may prove helpful for the Filipino patient in terms of safety and economy for long-term therapy . The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of oral zinc gluconate in the improvement of disease activity in acne vulgaris patients , to determine the demographic and clinical profile of Acne Vulgaris patients , to determine the disease activity measured by the inflammatory score and GAGS score of acne vulgaris patients on initial consult , at 4 weeks , and at 8 weeks , and to determine if there is a significant difference in disease activity as measured by the inflammatory score and GAGS score among acne vulgaris patients given placebo and oral zinc gluconate .

The extent of the arterial deoxygenation may be influenced by a histamine-mediated inflammatory response at the pulmonary capillary-alveolar membrane limiting oxygen diffusion . Moreover , while EIAH has been routinely explored in running and cycling , swimming is understudied despite potential mechanistic avenues which may put swimmers at further risk for EIAH . The purpose of this study is threefold : 1 ) to determine whether highly-trained swimmers experience EIAH during submaximal and maximal exercise , 2 ) to determine the extent to which histamine release influences oxyhemoglobin saturation during swimming exercise , and 3 ) to determine whether nedocromil sodium ( NS ) , a mast cell stabilizer , and cetirizine HCl ( CH ) , an H1-receptor competitive inhibitor , can improve oxyhemoglobin saturation during submaximal and maximal swimming exercise . Twenty-six ( 13 men , 13 women ) highly-trained swimmers will complete an intense swimming protocol to assess the histamine response to intense exercise . A subset with the highest histamine responses will participate in three additional sessions ( placebo , NS , and CH conditions ) which will include a swimming aerobic capacity test and 5-minutes of swimming at both 70 and 85 % of their maximal oxygen uptake .","For the first testing session , participants will report to the Indiana University Human Performance Laboratory to complete a medical screening and , if willing , consent to the procedures of the study . The medical screening will include measurements of height , weight , resting heart rate , resting blood pressure , and resting pulmonary function along with a health history questionnaire . The second testing session consists of an assessment of risk factors for development of EIAH , specifically changes in blood biomarkers pre- and post-swimming exercise . Participants will report to the Counsilman-Billingsley Aquatics Center and complete an exercise protocol designed to elicit an inflammatory response . Venous blood draws will be performed to assess participants ' pre-exercise complete blood count and pre- and post-intense exercise concentrations of plasma IL-1β , IL-8 , plasma histamine , whole blood histamine , and histamine release . Measurements of hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit will also be performed pre- and post-exercise in order to correct biomarker concentrations for fluid loss during exercise . Swimmers of each sex that exhibit the largest histamine release will be selected for further study until at least four swimmers of each sex complete all three experimental trials . Participants that exhibit increases in inflammatory markers following swimming exercise will visit the Human Performance Laboratory on three occasions separated by at least 48 hours and no more than 60 days . Apart from receiving a placebo ( PL ) or different drug treatment ( nedocromil sodium , NS ; cetirizine HCl , CH ) prior to exercise , participants will perform identical protocols on each visit to the laboratory . Participants will report to the lab and consume either a placebo or CH pill , followed by a health history update questionnaire and their resting pulmonary function will be measured . Participants will then complete a self-selected warm-up that will be standardized across all three testing sessions , followed by administration of either a placebo or NS through an inhaler and instrumentation . The exercise protocol beings with a progressive swimming test to maximum aerobic capacity ( V̇O2max ) in a swimming flume , followed by two constant load work bouts at approximately 70 and 85 % of the previously recorded HRmax while peripheral capillary oxyhemoglobin saturation ( SpO2 ) is continuously monitored . Participants will receive a 20-min break between each work bout .

Recently , the short-chain fatty acid , butyrate , has been reported to have some effect on blood pressure . Butyrate is not normally ingested since it is made by bacteria in the gut as a byproduct of fiber fermentation . In this proof of concept study , the investigators will investigate the effect of butyrate absorbed in the gut ( via the participant self-administering an enema with butyrate ) has on blood pressure .","Description : African Americans ( AA ) have the greatest burden of hypertension . Recently , gut microbial dysbiosis ( a term that describes a poorly diverse gut microbial profile and lower short-chain fatty acid ( SCFA ) production ) has been linked to hypertension and may be involved in the pathogenesis of hypertension in African Americans . African Americans have been reported to have lower gut SCFA and SCFA can reduce blood pressure . This is a proof of concept pilot study to determine the relationship between gut SCFA and blood pressure ( BP ) . Delivery of butyrate to the gut will be via enema . Objectives : The objectives of this research are to 1 . Identify gut microbial taxa ( SCFA butyrate-producing microbes ) and circulating butyrate levels associated with hypertension via a cross-sectional design in AA without and with hypertension . 2 .

Though OPV is safe and effective , it can mutate and reacquire neurovirulence in rare circumstances . This can result in vaccine-associated paralytic polio ( VAPP ) and circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses ( cVDPVs ) on rare occasions . Use of tOPV , therefore , had the risk of generating VAPP and seeding new type 2 circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses ( cVDPV2 ) , even though the wild type 2 virus was eradicated in September 2015 . For this reason tOPV vaccine was withdrawn globally in April 2016 and switched to the bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine ( bOPV ) . Circulating vaccine-derived type-2 poliovirus ( cVDPV2 ) outbreaks have occurred in sixteen countries after cassation of OPV2 . Using stockpiled mOPV2 to respond to this situation risks propagating new cVDPVs and this phenomenon has already been observed in multiple geographies following the switch . Inactivated polio vaccine ( IPV ) induces only limited intestinal mucosal immunity and is not effective to interrupt fecal-oral route transmission in settings of poor hygiene and sanitation . Therefore , development of novel oral polio vaccine/s with enhanced genetic stability and lower risk of reversion to neurovirulence compared to current Sabin 2 strains is a major priority of the global polio eradication Program . Knowledge gap : The current clinical development plan outlines studies through Phase II development with the nOPV2 candidate strains being tested in adult , toddler , and infant populations who have received prior dose/s of OPV and/or IPV . No study has been conducted in truly naive newborns with no prior receipt of any polio vaccines to strengthen the clinical evidence in favour of utilizing these novel OPV strains . Relevance : Existing Sabin type 2 polio virus vaccines can mutate in to pathogenic virus and become neurovirulent , causing VAPP and cVDVP . So novel type 2 polio virus candidate vaccines is an urgent need especially for outbreak situations . The nOPV2 strains are intended for use as safer alternatives to mOPV2 vaccines for outbreak response . Data from this proposed study result will further strengthen the clinical evidence base to deploy novel , genetically stable OPV strains to reduce the risk of generating cVDPV and VAPP . The study will generate data on novel OPV2 candidates for pre-licensure use in outbreak scenarios and for eventual full licensure and WHO Prequalification . Hypothesis : Vaccinating healthy newborns with novel type 2 polio virus candidate vaccines ( nOPV2 ) is safe and can induce a putatively protective immune response . Objectives : Primary Objectives : Safety : • To evaluate the safety and tolerability after one and two doses of nOPV2 vaccine candidates 1 , given 4 weeks apart in poliovirus vaccine-naïve newborns . Immunogenicity : • To evaluate the immune response ( measured by seroconversion rate ) to vaccination after one and two doses of nOPV2 vaccine candidate 1 , given 4 weeks apart in poliovirus vaccine-naïve newborns . Secondary objectives : Immunogenicity : To evaluate seroprotection rate , geometric mean and median titers to vaccination after one dose of nOPV2 vaccine candidate 1 in poliovirus vaccine-naïve newborns . To further evaluate seroprotection rate , geometric mean and median titers to vaccination after two doses of nOPV2 candidate 1 in poliovirus vaccine-naïve newborns .

To assess the extent of fecal viral shedding ( the quantity of nOPV2 virus shedding , measured asCCID50 per g of stool ) at fixed time points following one and two doses of nOPV2 vaccine candidate 1 in newborns . Exploratory objective : • To assess genetic stability through genetic deep sequencing assay and neurovirulence test through transgenic mice NV assays from a subset of participants stools samples . Methods : The study is a Phase II clinical trial which will be conducted in rural Bangladesh at Matlab . The total enrolment target for the clinical trial is 330 , with 220 in nOPV2 candidate 1 arm and 110 in placebo arm .

In order to record any immediate reaction participants will be observed for 30 minutes following each dose of vaccination . Study staff will visit homes of the participants daily for 7 days to collect systemic solicited adverse events after study vaccination using electronic dairy cards . Unsolicited adverse events , adverse events of special interest and serious adverse events will be collected throughout the entire study period by weekly home visit . Mothers of the participant will be provided a telephone number to communicate with the investigator for any adverse or serious adverse events .

New York State Psychiatric Institute,NCT04697693,Antidepressant Response in Older Adults With Comorbid PTSD and MDD,New York State Psychiatric Institute,4,0,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,Drug,Escitalopram,Treatment,,"In the Investigator 's ongoing studies of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) in older adults , it has been found that older adults with PTSD frequently meet the criteria for comorbid Major Depressive Disorder ( MDD ) . Moreover , relative to trauma-exposed healthy controls ( TEHCs ) , elders with PTSD manifest executive function deficits , fatigability , and mobility and physical function deficits that are consistent with what the investigator has observed in depressed older adults . Yet , the investigator has found that very few older adults with combined PTSD/MDD have received appropriate antidepressant treatment for their condition . These findings give rise to the questions of ( 1 ) how effective is antidepressant treatment for depressive symptoms in the context of PTSD/MDD and ( 2 ) are cognitive and physical function deficits in PTSD/MDD patients reversible with effective antidepressant treatment ?","Chronic PTSD in older adults leads to increased risk of mortality from cardiovascular disease , metabolic syndrome , diabetes mellitus , and ulcerative gastrointestinal disease . PTSD appears to promote aging-associated syndromes such as frailty , and older patients with PTSD exhibit faster cognitive decline and have twice the risk of dementia compared to individuals without PTSD . In addition , laboratory studies report accelerated biological signatures of aging in PTSD patients , including shortened leukocyte telomere length , increases in pro-inflammatory cytokines , and increased oxidative stress . PTSD is associated with similar anatomical brain changes to those occurring with cognitive aging , including bilateral hippocampal volume reductions , specifically affecting the dentate gyrus ( DG ) and CA3 subregion , and increased microvascular lesions ( white matter hyperintensities [ WMH ] ) . These observations suggest that the adverse health and functional outcomes associated with chronic PTSD in older patients may be explained by a deleterious interaction between pathophysiologic changes underlying PTSD and the biology of aging , the end result of which is to accelerate senescence throughout the body and particularly in the brain . However , no prior study has explicitly tested this hypothesis by examining indices of aging in older adults with and without PTSD . In our ongoing IRB # 7489 , The investigator hypothesize that chronic PTSD , over and above other contributing factors , accelerates biological aging in the brain and body , leading to adverse behavioral consequences such as frailty and cognitive decline . To test these hypotheses , 150 individuals are being recruited who are aged≥50and diagnosed with PTSD . A control group of 150 age- , sex- , and trauma exposure-matched subjects without PTSD are being recruited and assessed . Included subjects undergo comprehensive neuropsychological assessment and cerebral blood volume functional magnetic resonance imaging ( CBV-fMRI ) to assess regional hippocampal metabolic activity and function . Structural MRI is performed to quantify WMH , regional brain volume , and cortical thickness while resting-state fMRI measures functional connectivity within hippocampal networks . PTSD subjects and controls are compared on measures of aging within the following domains : neural ( DG CBV , WMH , morphology ) , cognitive ( processing speed , memory , executive function , pattern separation ) , somatic ( peripheral inflammatory markers , leukocyte telomere length , and measures of oxidative stress ) , and behavioral ( grip strength , gait speed , fatigue levels ) . By elucidating the interaction of chronic PTSD with aging processes , data from this project may contribute to the development of rationally designed , personalized , and age-appropriate novel treatments . Interim analyses of PTSD subjects in this study demonstrate a high degree of comorbidity with MDD . Among participants with PTSD enrolled to date , 67.1 % meet the criteria for MDD and the mean Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression ( HRSD ) is 18.1 . The most prominent cognitive differences observed to date in our study between PTSD and TEHC subjects is executive dysfunction , which is common in late-life depression . PTSD subjects have dramatically increased fatigability and prevalence of frailty criteria compared to TEHCs , abnormalities which are also frequently seen in our older MDD samples . Yet , the investigator has found that less than 25 % of these individuals are currently receiving an adequate dose and duration of first-line pharmacotherapy for MDD , while only one-third report any past medication treatment . These data raise the question of whether patients with combined PTSD/MDD could benefit from adequate antidepressant medication treatment and to what degree their cognitive and physical function deficits would be reversible with this therapy .",2021-01-04,"April 12, 2022","Inclusion Criteria : Individual has completed IRB 7489 Diagnosed with DSM 5 MDD HRSD > =18 Willing to and capable of providing informed consent and complying with study procedures .

Universidad Autonoma de San Luis Potosí,NCT04698525,Comparative Study Between Valproate and Memantine in the Prophylactic Management of Episodic Migraine.,Universidad Autonoma de San Luis Potosí,3,1,Migraine Headache,Drug,Valproate Sodium,Treatment,Single,"Migraine is one of the three most disabling diseases worldwide . Constituted by recurrent episodes of headache , characterized by unilateral location , throbbing character , moderate or severe intensity , worsening with physical activity , and association with nausea or photophobia and/or phonophobia . There are two types of drug treatment : abortifacient and prophylactic . The American Academy of Neurology classifies sodium valproate as level A ; however , some patients do not obtain a satisfactory response rate and/or have adverse effects . Therefore , the search for new pharmacological treatments continues . In 2015 , a double-blind , randomized clinical trial with a placebo was carried out to assess Memantine 's efficacy in the prophylactic treatment of migraine without aura , which reported a reduction of 2.3 migraine attacks per month compared to the placebo group . Memantine could be a new effective treatment alternative , which is why we will compare the efficacy of Memantine against sodium valproate as a prophylactic migraine treatment . Main objective : To compare the efficacy of Memantine at a rate of 20mg divided into two doses a day against sodium valproate ( VPA ) at a rate of 1000mg divided into two doses a day prophylactic treatment of migraine for three months . Study design : a prospective controlled , randomized , double-blind clinical trial . Inclusion criteria : Men and women aged 18 to 65 years with a diagnosis at least one year before the study must present at least 2 to 8 migraine attacks per month and less than 15 days with headache per month , which should not be receiving prophylactic treatment for migraine and sign an informed consent Sample size calculation and statistical analysis : It is calculated using the normal distribution model , where the recommended sample size is 196 participants . Since a pilot study will be conducted , 10 % of the sample size will be taken to make it representative , a sample size of 20 participants is decided for each group .","Migraine is a primary headache , currently one of the three most disabling diseases globally . It has an annual and lifetime prevalence of 18 % and 33 % in women , and 6 to 13 % in men , respectively , with a predominance in women ( 3 : 1 ) . The age of onset with the highest prevalence is between 25 and 55 years . Migraine is described by the International Headache Society ( IHS ) as recurrent episodes of headache lasting 4 to 72 hours , characterized by unilateral location , pulsatile character , moderate or severe intensity , worsening with physical activity , and association with nausea or photophobia and phonophobia . The IHS also classifies migraine based on the frequency of attacks : episodic migraine when the headache occurs on less than 15 days a month , and chronic migraine , when the headache occurs 15 or more days a month for three months and at least eight days a month with characteristics of migraine headache . The subtypes of migraine concerning their clinical presentation are migraine with aura and without aura.4 Up to one-third of patients present migraine aura , with visual symptoms being the most frequent . Four phases have been identified during a migraine : prodromal phase , aura , headache , and postdrome . The prodromal phase is characterized by premonitory symptoms hours before the headache , including difficulty concentrating , irritability , fatigue , repetitive yawning , stiff neck , and photophobia . Recurrent episodes characterize the aura , lasting from 5min to 60min , with transient unilateral visual , sensory , or other CNS symptoms that develop progressively , usually precede headache and symptoms associated with migraine.4 The aura 's genesis is activated by the NMDA ( N-methyl-D-aspartate ) receptor and disseminated cortical depression . Disseminated cortical depression is an extreme depolarization of the cell membranes of the glia and neurons that produce an alteration of the ionic gradient , an increase in extracellular potassium concentrations , glutamate release , and a transient increase followed by a decrease in cerebral blood flow . The pain phase in migraine is due to the activation and sensitization of the trigeminovascular pain pathway , which innervates intracranial structures , including the eye , the dura mater , large braincases , and the venous sinuses . It has been shown to involve neuronal presynaptic activation by ID serotonin receptors ( 5-HT 1D ) , resulting in the release of the calcitonin gene ( CGRP ) and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide ( PACAP-38 ) , which are neuroinflammatory peptides . The post-synaptic effect on the meninges includes the activation of the arachidonic acid cascade , which conditions inflammation and vasodilation , stimulates the nociceptive afference of pain first branch of the trigeminal nerve . The diagnosis of migraine is clinical and must meet the criteria of the IHS International Classification of Headaches ( ICH-3 ) , which are for migraine without aura : At least five crises that meet criteria B-D. A. Headache episodes are lasting 4 to 72 hours ( untreated or unsuccessfully treated ) . B . The headache has at least two of the following four characteristics : Unilateral location . Pulsatile character . Pain of moderate or severe intensity . Made worse by or conditions the abandonment of habitual physical activity ( e.g. , walking or climbing stairs ) . C. At least one of the following during the headache : Nausea and vomiting . Photophobia and phonophobia . D. No better explanation by another diagnosis of ICHD-III . The non-pharmacological treatment of migraine goes hand in hand with the pharmacological one ; one is to avoid the triggers of the migraine attacks and carry out the lifestyle modifications . Pharmacological treatment is divided into acute ( administered at the time of headache ) and prophylactic ( administered daily to reduce the chances of migraine episodes ) . The objective of prophylactic treatment is to reduce the frequency , duration , and severity of migraine attacks , improve the response to acute treatment , improve functionality , and reduce disability . The American Academy of Neurology recommends initiating prophylactic treatment in patients with migraine with one or more of the following characteristics9 Recurrent migraine , which interferes with the patient 's daily life and quality of life . Frequent headaches . That they have an inadequate response or contraindication to abortive treatment . Adverse events to abortion treatment . Uncommon migraine conditions : ophthalmoplegic migraine , basilar migraine , hemiplegic , prolonged aura , migraine infarction . The IHS defines the response to treatment as a decrease equal to or greater than 50 % in the frequency of migraine attacks compared to the baseline situation . The American Academy of Neurology guideline for the prophylactic drug treatment of episodic migraine classifies divalproex sodium , valproate sodium ( VPA ) , topiramate , metoprolol propranolol as level A ( Drugs with established efficacy ) . Valproic acid ( 2-propylpentaenoic acid ) was first synthesized in 1882 as an analog of valeric acid , naturally found in valerian . Anyone of Valproic acid , sodium valproate , or a mixture of the two ( sodium valproate ) has a mechanism of action characterized by increasing or improving GABA neurotransmission , blocking voltage-gated sodium channels , and T-type calcium channels . In 2013 , Cochrane conducted the review : Valproate for the prophylaxis of episodic migraine ( Linda et al . ) , where they evaluated ten clinical trials . Two crossover clinical trials for sodium valproate demonstrated a significant reduction in headache frequency than placebo ( MD -4.31 95 % CI -8.32 to -0.30 ) , which shows us in clinical terms an approximate reduction of four headaches for every 28 days . Jensen 199413 showed that sodium valproate is superior to placebo ( OR 4.67 ; 95 % CI 1.54 - 14.14 ) , suggesting that patients are three times more likely to present a reduction equal to or greater than 50 % in the frequency of headaches compared to placebo . The recommended dose for migraine headaches is 500-1000mg per day . The most common adverse effects are asthenia , fatigue , dizziness/vertigo , nausea , tremor , and weight gain . In recent years , interest has increased in glutamate receptor antagonists for migraine prophylaxis , such as memantine . Within the pathophysiology of migraine , glutamate is implicated in disseminated cortical depression , trigeminal-vascular activation . Other studies corroborate its role by reporting elevated glutamate levels in the cerebrospinal fluid in patients with chronic migraine in the ictal period and elevated serum levels in migraine patients . Besides , after experimental stimulation in the dura and the ventral-posteromedial thalamic nucleus structures , elevated levels of glutamate in the trigeminal-cervical complex have been evidenced . fifteen In 2008 Bigal and colleagues conducted the first open clinical trial , a pilot study to evaluate memantine 's efficacy and safety as a prophylactic treatment in patients diagnosed with refractory migraine . A sample of 28 participants who had a baseline frequency of headache days of 21.8 days per month received memantine from 10mg to 20mg per day for three months . A decrease in the frequency of headache days was obtained to 16.1 ( P < 0.01 ) . Therefore , the authors concluded that memantine as a prophylactic treatment is safe and effective in refractory migraines . In 2015 , Noruzzadeh and colleagues conducted the first randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate memantine 's efficacy as a prophylactic treatment of migraine without aura With a sample of 52 participants , 25 with memantine ( 10 mg/day ) and 27 with placebo . The memantine group had a more significant reduction in the frequency of migraine attacks compared to placebo , which was a difference of 2.3 attacks per month with a P < 0.001.14",2020-12-08,"May 13, 2023","Inclusion Criteria : Men and women from 18 to 65 years old .

ECG morphology effect . In the above entitled studies we are going to determine the effects of the above two 4th generation fluoroquinolones drugs on the blood glucose levels and ECG morphology effect.of euglycemics healthy volunteers.The drug will be gave as per approved standard adult dose.The drug is FDA approved and marketed drug.No risk is to the patient only 3-5 ml of the blood will be taken at baseline and after the drug completion at steady state concentration .,"The study will be conducted under good clinical practice guidelines and a consent form will be signed from the healthy volunteers as per design of World health organization.The study has no harmful effects on the heaths of the volunteers as we are conducting the study for five dose/one pack drug will be gaven . The volunteers will be sampled randomly and the effect of the said drugs will be determined on blood glucose and insulin level . Diabetes mellitus ( DM ) , a non-communicable disease , which is considered now-a-days a life threatening disease to the human health ( 1,2 ) .According to the report of International Diabetes Federation ( IFD ) and World Health Organization ( WHO ) , diabetes mellitus is one of the World 's fifth leading cause of mortality and about 415 million people of the world 's population have diabetes mellitus in 2018 ( 3 ) . After every 6 seconds , a person dies from diabetes mellitus ( 4 , 5 ) . Pakistan is a country with 7th highest diabetic population in the world and it is assumed to rise to 4th highest place by 2030 ( 6 ) . Due to sedentary life style of People , there is a maximum increase of DM in the last decade ( 7 ) . DM is classified into two classes i.e . Type I and Type II ( 8 ) . The Type I diabetes is much more common . It is due to defective insulin secretion or insulin action or both ( 9 ) . The Type II diabetes is now-a-days attributed to genetic disorders affecting the beta cells of the pancreas ( 10 ) , or the ability of body cells to respond to insulin action leading to insulin resistance DM ( 11 , 12 ) . Fluoroquinolones ( FQs ) are a group of antibacterial antibiotics . Newer fluoroquinolones has expanded its traditional coverage from Gram-negative coverage to Gram-positive as well as to anaerobic organisms ( 14-16 ) . It has been used since 2-3 decades and has been observed to have excellent anti-microbial coverage , but unfortunately the FQs are associated with adverse drug events including strong dysglycemic effects which has also led to irreversible brain damage and even death ( 17 ) . Till date , six different types of adverse drug reactions have been reported with Fluoroquinolones . These include prolongation of QT interval , Photo toxicity , hepatotoxicity and alteration in the blood glucose hemostasis ( hyperglycemia or sometimes hypoglycemia ) , damage to the tendons leading to tendinitis ( 18 ) . Canadian Adverse Drug Reaction Monitoring Program ( CADRMP ) reported that three marketed fluoroquinolones namely gatifloxacin , levofloxacin and moxifloxacilin are under Metabolic and Nutritional Disorders category . Among them Temafloxacin , levofloxacin and gatifloxacin have been reported to be associated with hemolysis ( 19 ) . It has been assumed that the dysglycemic effects of FQs mainly occur through their action on the ATP- sensitive K + channels . According to definition , an agent that causes the selective relaxation of an induced contractility due to low K+ ( 20-25 mM ) is grouped as K+ channel opener . From the studies it can be assumed that fluoroquinolones may block the ATP-sensitive K+ channels as well as the opening of as Calcium channels that are voltage dependent ( 22 ) . These opened Calcium channels further depolarize the membrane potential ultimately releasing insulin . These Studies reveals that fluoroquinolones have pancreatic beta cell cytotropic activity , however the dysglycemic effects of Moxifloxacin and Gemifloxacin have not been proven but very strong associations have been demonstrated via some case report studies ( 21 ) . Keeping in view all these studies and developments regarding the adverse effects associated with fluoroquinolones specially the dysglycemic effects due to cytotropic influence on the beta cells of the pancreas it is now very much needed to actually correlate these effects seen in the beta cells of the pancreas with the pancreatic tissue histopathological changes . Since , Moxifloxacin and Gemifloxacin are a new generation quinolones , thus our study focuses on them to get a clear picture of its possible shift of blood glucose and insulin in our society . Thus the hallmark of our study is to focus on dysglycemic effects ( either hyperglycemic or hypoglycemic effects ) associated with quinolones , it is not clear to get a clear picture on blood glucose level until it is tested in control environment of a preclinical study , and to translate the possible effects of the preclinical study in a controlled clinical trial of healthy volunteers who are euglycemics as well .",2020-12-29,"April 10, 2023",Inclusion Criteria : Healthy volunteers having age from 20- 40 years Non-Diabetic Non-Alcoholics Non-Smokers Non-Hypertensive Exclusion Criteria : Patients with QT interval prolongation in ECG Patients unwilling to give consent Patients already on antibiotic therapy for a period one to two week or above .

"Ophirex, Inc.",NCT04969991,Study of Varespladib in Patients Hospitalized With Severe COVID-19,"Ophirex, Inc.",2,0,Coronavirus Disease 2019,Drug,Varespladib,Treatment,Quadruple,"This is a 2-part , multi-center , randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , phase 2 study designed to evaluate the safety , tolerability , and efficacy of oral varespladib , in addition to standard of care , in patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 .","The goals of this 2-part , multi-center , randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , phase 2 study are to define a safe dose for the population and to assess the safety , tolerability , and efficacy of orally dosed varespladib to improve survival without respiratory failure in patients hospitalized with severe coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID-19 ) , when given in addition to the institutional standard of care therapy . Mortality rates of COVID-19 are strongly linked to acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) which may be , additionally , correlated with elevations of secretory phospholipase 2 ( sPLA2 ) and widespread loss of functioning lung tissue . Upregulation of sPLA2 is thought to be involved in the dysregulated inflammatory cascade pathways ( increased markers of immune activation , also known as cytokine release syndrome ) and enzymatic degradation of lung surfactant linked to the development of ARDS . It is believed that treatment with varespladib , a potent inhibitor of sPLA2 , might prevent or mitigate progression of pulmonary dysfunction in COVID-19 patients by two mechanisms : suppression of sPLA2-induced inflammation and , uniquely , preservation of pulmonary surfactant by direct inhibition of the enzyme responsible for surfactant phospholipid degradation : sPLA2 . Data from previous phase 2 clinical trials of varespladib suggested it had potential to reduce mortality in severely septic patients with ARDS , particularly when treatment was initiated within 18 hours of identification of organ failure . The study will be conducted in two parts . Both parts will be randomized and double-blind . Part 1 will be dose-finding in four parallel treatment groups randomized to treatment with varespladib ( at 250 mg once daily [ QD ] , twice daily [ BID ] , or three times daily [ TID ] [ 250 , 500 , or 750 mg/day ] ) or placebo in a 5:5:5:3 ratio . After all participants in Part 1 have completed Day 28 , a data safety monitoring board ( DSMB ) will review the safety results from Part 1 , including all available safety data through Day 60 , and will recommend the dose regimen to be used in Part 2 . Part 2 will randomize an additional 72 participants to the dose regimen selected from Part 1 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio . In both parts of the study , eligible participants will be enrolled and randomized to receive active varespladib or placebo in addition to institutional standard of care for 7 days . Participants will be assessed daily per standard of care while hospitalized and on a regular basis after discharge . The Day 1 , 4 , 7 , 14 , and 28 visits will be performed in person ( either at the hospital/site or via a home health provider ) to assess safety , obtain blood and urine samples for laboratory tests , and obtain clinical outcome data . The Day 2 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 , 45 , and 60 visits for discharged participants may be conducted by phone or via electronic patient-reported outcome ( ePRO ) devices . Efficacy will be assessed by respiratory failure-free survival at Day 28 . Safety will be assessed by evaluating adverse events ( AEs ) , vital sign measurements , use of oxygen therapies , changes in levels of biomarkers , clinical laboratory test results , electrocardiograms ( ECGs ) , physical examination findings , and concomitant medications and therapies . A DSMB will evaluate safety data at specified intervals during both parts of the trial . Pharmacokinetic ( PK ) samples will be drawn from all participants in Part 1 and in a subset of approximately 14 participants in Part 2 in order to enable estimation of PK parameters in approximately 22 participants receiving active treatment with varespladib .",2021-07-08,"August 3, 2023","Inclusion Criteria : Participant is hospitalized with severe COVID-19 illness , defined in accordance with the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) Guidance for Industry - COVID-19 : Developing Drugs and Biological Products for Treatment or Prevention ( May 2020 ) : a .

Screening and Enrollment This trial will enroll over a 6-month period and take place at three sites ( Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children 's Hospital of Chicago , Cincinnati Children 's Hospital Medical Center and The Children 's Hospital of Philadelphia ) that are or were members of the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network ( PECARN ) , a federally funded network of 18 pediatric EDs that have an established and successful history of completing large-scale clinical trials in the ED . This study will enroll 36 patients in total ( 2 patients per month , per site ) . Clinical research coordinators ( CRCs ) at participating EDs will screen potentially eligible patients with respiratory tract symptoms and discuss eligibility with the treating attending physician . If thought to be eligible and a diagnosis of CAP is presumed by the treating physician , the CRC will approach the patient to complete screening procedures . The study will proceed in 2 stages , each with its own informed consent process . During Stage 1 , baseline characteristics and serum PCT levels will be ascertained . Stage 2 will consist of a randomized trial of amoxicillin vs. placebo in the subset of patients from Stage 1 that have PCT < 0.25 ng/mL . Randomization After enrollment and confirmation of a PCT < 0.25 ng/mL , patients will be randomized to a 10-day course of either amoxicillin ( 80-100 mg/kg divided BID up to 4,000 mg/day ) or placebo . Randomization to amoxicillin or placebo will be at a 1:1 ratio with block sizes of 2 and 4 . Patients will be stratified by the clinical site and randomization will be performed through an online system . As a double-blind clinical trial , the study patients and their parents/guardians , investigators and study staff will be blinded to study treatment assignment for the duration of the study . Study Drug Administration Local investigational drug pharmacies will be provided with active study medication ( i.e. , amoxicillin ) and matching placebo . Site pharmacies at each institution will store study drug and dispense as needed . Study medications will both be liquid reconstituted from powder , and will resemble each other with regards to appearance , favor , consistency and packaging . Study products will be labeled with numerical codes that will maintain allocation concealment . Site investigational pharmacies will be provided with amoxicillin and placebo , in addition to the randomization scheme . The pharmacy will aliquot amoxicillin and placebo into blinded bottles based on randomization scheme . Follow-up The guardians of participants will be asked to complete a daily symptom diary , using an online data collection form in REDCap , during the first 7 days after the initial Emergency Department study visit . The follow-up will assess patient condition , clinical response , signs or symptoms of clinical deterioration and other adverse effects . The primary outcome will be assessed at day 7 ( +/- 2 days ) , using video chat technology that is standard on most smart phones , tablets , and computers . Video follow-up will be performed by site clinician investigators . In the rare case that a mobile device or computer with video chat technology is not available to the family , the day 7 follow-up will occur by telephone or text through an online system . A final follow-up , performed by site research staff , by telephone call , will occur at Day 21 ( +/- 2 days ) to assess overall disease course and secondary outcomes . Data Collection At baseline , demographics , medical history , and history of current illness will be obtained from all participants during stage 1 ( pre-randomization ) . Vital signs will be obtained and a brief physical examination will be performed . After the initial ED visit , patients will record symptoms on daily basis for 6 days via an online data collection form . Follow-up assessments will be completed via telehealth visit or telephone for days 7 and 21 . Follow-up visits will collect data regarding symptoms , adverse events and return to medical care , in addition to assessing adherence to study procedures ( i.e. , medication adherence and daily symptom diary completion ) .

Design : A single-blinded , prospective randomized parallel controlled clinical trial was designed and conducted from December 2019 to November 2020 . The study was conducted in an academic hospital . 82 patients with a gallstone , gallbladder polyp and other benign gallbladder diseases were enrolled in this study . Finally , 82 patients were randomly divided into the Micro Hand S surgical robot group and the da Vinci surgical robot group . Interventions : Standard robot-assisted transabdominal cholecystectomy was conducted using the Micro Hand S robot or the da Vinci robot . Main outcomes and measures : The main outcome was the success rate of operation . Surgical success was defined as that the surgical procedures were completed by the experimental or control product without transferring to non-robotic surgery . Secondary outcomes included assembly time , operation time , intraoperative hemorrhage , time to first flatus , postoperative pain , comprehensive complication index , resident time and patient satisfaction . Background : Cholecystectomy is one of the most common operations in general surgery , with about half a million patients getting cholecystectomy each year in the United States . In the 1990s , minimally invasive surgery ( MIS ) , as a new technology , greatly improved the traditional open abdominal surgery , of which defects are known as the big wound and long time to recover . Today , nearly 90 % of cholecystectomy are performed laparoscopically . Previous studies have shown that laparoscopic cholecystectomy may reduce postoperative pain , shorten the hospital stay , and save the overall cost in hospital , which has become the standard operation for the treatment of gallbladder disease . In recent years , robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery has become more and more widely used in general surgery because of its advantages of 3D visions , high magnification , tremor suppression , and precise manipulation . According to a reported retrospective study , the da Vinci robot-assisted cholecystectomy showed excellent operation security , which can achieve the same therapeutic effect as the conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy . But studies also reported that the increased cost may be the main problem of the da Vinci robot-assisted cholecystectomy . The Micro Hand S surgical robot is a new generation of Chinese independently developed surgical robot system . Apart from the flexibility and intelligence in operation manipulation , the Micro Hand S surgical robot also has the advantages of small size , portable equipment , low maintenance costs and outstanding equipment compatibility . After initial preclinical trials , the Micro Hand S surgical robot has been successfully applied in clinic , and proved security and feasibility in various gastrointestinal surgery . Since 2019 , investigators in this group have designed and taken up research to assist laparoscopic cholecystectomy with the Micro Hand S surgical robot , which is noted as a prospective , randomized , single-blind , and parallel controlled clinical trial . The primary purpose of this study is to determine whether the newly developed Chinese Micro Hand S surgical robot results in non-inferiority outcomes in cholecystectomy compared with the prevalent da Vinci robot . Method : The study was designed as a single-blind prospective randomized clinical trial since it is inevitable for the surgeon to know what kind of robot to use during the operation . After obtaining the approval of the Ethics Review Committee and other relevant institutions of the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University , a total of 82 patients were included in this study from December 2019 to November 2020 . Finally , 82 patients were randomly divided into the Micro Hand S robot group and the da Vinci robot group . All enrolled patients were fully informed and signed the informed consent . Patients were randomly assigned to each group in a 1:1 ratio , and information of the grouping and intervention measures were not available to patients . Patients of each group were matched for age , sex , body mass index ( BMI ) , and complications to reduce confounding intervention factors . Surgical procedure : The patient was placed in the supine position after general anesthesia . The Veress needle was inserted at 2cm below the umbilicus ( point A ) to establish the CO2 artificial pneumoperitoneum . A 12mm trocar was inserted into the abdominal cavity and the pneumoperitoneum tube was connected to the trocar . The intra-abdominal pressure was set at 11-13mmHg , and then the preheated three-dimensional laparoscope and cold-light source were placed into the abdominal cavity through the trocar . Then a thorough examination was taken on the intended trocar points and the surgical area . After adjusting the patient with a Trendelenburg position inclined to the left , 10.5mm magnetic trocars were respectively placed at 2-3cm medial side of the right anterior axillary line , 8-10cm below the costal margin ( point B ) ; and 2-3cm below the costal margin of the left mid-clavicular line ( point C ) ; and were connected to the robotic arms No . 1 and 2 . Besides , a 10mm trocar were placed at point D ( lateral inferior of the line connecting point A and C ) as the auxiliary channel . The surgeon held the neck of the gallbladder or Hartmann 's Pouch with bipolar forceps , and pulled the neck to the right upper to open the serosal layer of the cystic duct . The cystic duct and the cystic artery were then separated by blunt dissection so as to distinguish the common bile duct , hepatic common bile duct , and cystic duct . Clamp and cut off the cystic duct near the gallbladder 's neck with a Hemo-lock clamp . The cystic artery was found medial posterior side of the cystic duct . Clamp and cut off the cystic artery with Hemo-lock clamp . Pull the gallbladder 's neck upward and remove the gallbladder by anterograde resection with an ultrasonic knife . The assistant assisted in dragging the gallbladder and the liver bed to keep a certain tension . The intact gallbladder was put into the specimen bag and removed . Bleeding and bile leakage was carefully checked , and the gallbladder bed was coagulated . The operating instruments were withdrawn from the patient 's abdominal cavity after checking the instruments and the gauze . The pneumoperitoneum was exsufflated and the incisions were closed . During the operation , the assembly time , intraoperative blood loss , operation time , operation success rate , and the adjacent organ and vascular injury caused by the failure of the tested system were recorded . Pain score was analyzed 24±2 hours after the surgery . The vital signs ( temperature , pulse , respiration , blood pressure ) were measured on the 3rd day postoperatively . Meanwhile , the routine blood test ( red blood cells , white blood cells and neutrophils , platelet , hemoglobin ) , liver and renal function ( ALT , AST , TP , ALB , GLU , TBIL , BUN , and CREA ) , the electrolyte ( K , Na , Cl , Ca ) , blood sugar , and color ultrasound of liver , gallbladder , pancreas and spleen were checked . Operating surgeons filled in the satisfaction questionnaire postoperatively . Furthermore , the patients ' postoperative condition changes , postoperative medication , the first postoperative anal exhaust , postoperative complications , and resident time were also recorded . All the patients were followed up by telephone at 30±5 days postoperatively to evaluate the incidncee of adverse events .",2021-03-12,"March 16, 2021","Inclusion Criteria : from 18 to 65 years old ; patients with acute or chronic cholecystitis , gallstone , gallbladder polyp and other benign gallbladder diseases ; BMI was 18-30 kg/m2 ; the American Society of Anesthesiologists ( ASA ) classification was I , II , or III .

National University of Malaysia,NCT04573218,Supplementation of Oil Palm Phenolics to Improve Lipid Profile in Subjects With Minor Hyperlipidaemia,Isa Naina Mohamed,2,1,Hyperlipidemias,Drug,Placebo,Treatment,Triple,"An unpublished study by the investigators on healthy participants has shown that the supplementation of oil palm phenolics ( OPP ) at 250 mg is the optimum dose to demonstrate the ability to lower total and LDL cholesterol . There is no clinical evidence as yet on that optimum dosage of OPP supplementation in improving fasting lipid profile in minor hyperlipidemia subjects . The investigators hypothesize that in a clinical study , OPP supplemented to the minor hyperlipidemic participants will elicit a reduction in total and LDL cholesterol while maintaining safety and tolerability . OPP may have the potential to be positioned as natural health supplement in improving lipid profile .","Oil palm phenolics ( OPP ) is a product filtrated from vegetation liquor of an aqueous waste stream following palm oil milling process . A novel process to recover OPP that contains a high amount of phenolic from the waste has been explored tremendously . Due to the high phenolic content , OPP has been postulated in possessing various medicinal properties such as antioxidant , anti-inflammatory , neuroprotective and anti-tumour effects . Hyperlipidemia is a well-known risk factor for cardiovascular diseases ( CVD ) . It can be defined as elevations of fasting total cholesterol or triglyceride concentration or both . According to a previous research , OPP supplementation to hamster animal model has shown positive effects in the reduction of total cholesterol and triglycerides as well as improvement of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL-C ) . In a previous study using the rabbit animal model , OPP has shown a protective effect against atherosclerosis , a condition whereby fat and cholesterol plaques are deposited inside the arteries . Based on the current evidence from the preliminary studies on OPP , the investigators hypothesize that supplementation of OPP may prevent or delay the development of CVD . In the investigator 's previous clinical trial phase I , an optimum dosage of OPP has been obtained . Therefore , the investigators proposed a phase II clinical trial to evaluate the ability of OPP to reduce the total and LDL cholesterol in minor hyperlipidemic participants . This study will be initiated with the recruitment of 50 volunteers with minor hyperlipidemic condition . In this study , the participants will be supplemented with placebo/OPP capsules for 60 days . Participants will be required to take the placebo/OPP capsules in front of the study staff to ensure compliance . Blood samples will be withdrawn at baseline , day 30 and day 60 , and will be analyzed for lipid profile , antioxidant and anti-inflammatory status .

Leiden University Medical Center,NCT04577066,Safety and Preliminary Protective Efficacy of Genetically Attenuated GA2 Parasites.,Leiden University Medical Center,1,1,Plasmodium Falciparum Malaria,Other,GA2,Prevention,Double,This study will consist of two phases and be aimed at assessing the safety and tolerability of the new genetically attenuated GA2 malaria parasite ( Phase 1 ) and its preliminary protective efficacy against controlled human malaria infection ( Phase 2 ) in healthy Dutch volunteers .,"Malaria is one of the most common tropical diseases , accounting for 228 million infections and 450.000 deaths each year . It is caused by five species of protozoan parasites belonging to the genus of the Plasmodia . Plasmodia have a complex life cycle : they are injected into the human host by female Anopheles mosquitos , migrate to the liver to replicate and then enter red blood cells . The typical symptoms of malaria with fever episodes are caused by the bursting of red blood cells , as the parasites leave to infect new cells . The rising resistance of both parasites against anti-malarial drugs and mosquitoes against insecticides , make the need to eradicate malaria even more impellent . A promising approach to disease control is the development of an effective vaccine . Among the different approaches to vaccine development , live attenuated parasites stand out for their high protective efficacy ( > 90 % ) . The GA2 parasite , a new genetically attenuated malaria parasite , which is derived from the NF45 Plasmodium falciparum strain and has been engineered to arrest development in the liver before entering the bloodstream , was recently created . It should therefore not be able to cause malaria in humans . The idea is that the GA2 parasite will prime the immune system for recognition of non attenuated parasites in the future without causing disease itself . In other words , exposure to the innocuous GA2 parasite could confer protection against pathogenic malaria parasites . Hence , this study is aimed at investigating the safety and tolerability of the GA2 parasite and at determining its potential protective efficacy against controlled human malaria infection . The former question will be investigated by exposing volunteers to sequentially increasing numbers of GA2-infected mosquito bites . The latter question will be investigated by repeatedly ( 3 times ) exposing volunteers to the GA2 parasite and once to unattenuated parasites . The efficacy of the GA2 parasite will be compared to another genetically attenuated parasite , the GA1 , which in previous studies has been shown to be safe and well-tolerated but only have limited protective efficacy . There will also be a placebo group .",2020-09-22,"January 12, 2023","Inclusion Criteria : Subject is aged ≥ 18 and ≤ 35 years and in good health .

To evaluate safety and efficacy of a bolus loading dose and continuous intravenous infusion of L-Citrulline compared to placebo in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infection ( SARS-CoV-2 ) .","Intravenous L-citrulline ( Turnobi ) administration will safely restore the homeostasis of nitric oxide synthase by increasing both plasma citrulline and arginine levels . Investigators also reason that restoration of citrulline/arginine balance through citrulline administration will safely re-establish homeostasis of NOS , lower oxidative stress , and reduce inflammation , thereby delaying and potentially preventing the need for invasive mechanical ventilation in participants hospitalized with COVID-19 infection ( SARS-CoV-2 ) . The body lives in a delicate balance of homeostasis . The urea/NO cycle plays a critical role in maintaining redox homeostasis and as such , also plays a role in regulating inflammation . The biochemical relationships are complex and depend on inter-organ transfer , membrane transport , and intracellular compartmentation . However , data above demonstrate that citrulline , arginine , and NO are critical in maintaining this homeostasis through their regulation of NOS . Inflammation , especially from infection , results in decreased activity of CPS1 and increased activity of arginase , which decreases levels of both citrulline and arginine . These decreased levels result in dysregulated and uncoupled NOS , which drives both overexuberant NO production and formation of ROS . Both the NO production and ROS further exacerbate the inflammatory cascade , resulting in other organ dysfunctions , including acute lung injury . Both inflammation and oxidative stress have been shown to be driving forces for the development of ALI and regulated NOS function is vital to reducing both . Both plasma citrulline and arginine are deficient in sepsis and levels are inversely associated with development of ALI . Furthermore , citrulline replacement safely increases plasma levels of both citrulline and arginine in healthy volunteers , BMT patients , adults with sepsis , children with sickle cell disease , and children after congenital heart surgery . It seems highly likely that citrulline therapy in the setting of COVID-19 ( SARS-CoV2 ) induced acute hypoxemic respiratory illness will safely increase citrulline and arginine levels and help re-establish NOS homeostasis , resulting in NO production in compartments that are more homeostatically appropriate so as to reduce pulmonary vascular resistance and enhance coupling of NOS to minimize superoxide production thus reducing free radical mediated ALI .",2020-09-17,"January 26, 2023","Inclusion Criteria : Age 18-65 years .

The SSTS is non-invasive and imposes no restrictions on patient mobility , which renders it particularly suitable for clinical conditions where early mobilization is a key component of successful surgical outcome . The present study tests the hypothesis that SSTS is an efficient and safe analgesic technique allowing fast track rehabilitation after total knee arthroplasty in a prospective cohort design .","Total knee arthroplasty is one of the most common major procedures performed today with a significant impact on health care budgets . Fast track rehabilitation programmes are being developed to control hospitalization costs associated with this procedure . Interestingly , such pathway controlled fast track programs also appear to enhance functional recovery and to reduce complications . These beneficial effects are mainly attributed to the practice of rapid mobilization and early intensified physiotherapy which can only be achieved with effective analgesic techniques . Current PCA techniques - predominantly morphine based - are the gold standard for this purpose but they involve intravenous access and a programmable computer system requiring close supervision . Reported shortcomings are systems failure leading to analgesic gaps , drug errors and restrictions in mobility since patients are tethered to IV poles . The SSTS may overcome these limitations because the opioid used , sufentanil , has a more predictable time of onset , the delivery system does not require programming , and the device does not limit patient 's mobility . It retains the benefits of potent analgesia as well as patient empowerment and is particularly suited to target the analgesic effect precisely to the level required in physiotherapeutic sessions .

( Control Group ) in patients undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass grafting surgery ( CABG ) at a tertiary care cardiac center of Karachi , Pakistan . STUDY DESIGN : Randomized control trial PLACE & DURATION OF STUDY : The research will be conducted in the Department of Anesthesia & Intensive Care , National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases ( NICVD ) , Karachi . 6 months ( 01/08/2021 to 31/1/2022 ) . DATA COLLECTION PROCEDURE : This study was conducted among 60 patients allocated randomly into two groups . In the study group ( group D ) , dexmedetomidine was given as an infusion of 0.4 μg/kg/h from induction of anesthesia for 24 hours . In the control group ( group C ) , the patients were receiving an equal volume of normal saline . PRIMARY OUTCOME : The primary outcome of the study was Serum Creatinine ( mg/dl ) which was measured before the surgery at baseline and then 48 hours after surgery . SECONDARY OUTCOMES : The secondary outcomes were incidence of urine output per hour for up to 48 hours after surgery , operative time from induction of anesthesia till skin closure , aortic cross-clamp time from application of aortic cross-clamping till aortic declamping , CPB time from connecting the patient to extracorporeal circulation till termination of CPB , duration of ICU stay from transferring the patient from the operating room to the ICU till patient discharge to the ward , episodes of bradycardia and hypotension , dosage of inotropics and hemoglobin levels at baseline and up to 48 hours . KEYWORDS : cardiac surgery-associated acute kidney injury , dexmedetomidine , serum creatinine .","INTRODUCTION : The incidence of cardiac surgery-associated acute kidney injury ( CSA-AKI ) varies from 5 to 42 % .1 This percentage was found to be 7.86 % according to study conducted in Pakistan . 2 Severe CSA-AKI is independently associated with three to eight-fold higher perioperative mortality , prolonged ICU and hospital length of stay , and increased cost of care.3 The etiology of renal injury is mainly due to elevation of renin levels as a result of sympathetic overactivity in addition to nephrotoxic inflammatory and hemodynamic components.4 The risk risk factors , even for those patients with complete renal recovery.3 As yet , there is no definite strategy for preventing AKI after cardiac surgery.5 Dexmedetomidine is a selective and potent α2-adrenoceptor agonist that is used for its anxiolytic , sedative , and analgesic properties.6 It decreases central nervous system sympathetic outflow in a dose-dependent manner and has opioid-sparing analgesic effects . There is increasing evidence of its organ-protective properties against ischemic and hypoxic injury , including cardioprotection , neuroprotection , and renoprotection.7,8 Peng et al . in his meta-analysis has highlighted the significant role of dexmedetomidine in reducing AKI after bypass surgeries.8 Then , R.Shi and H-T. Toe have also pointed out the promising renoprotective role of Dexmedetomidine in CABG surgeries . 10 Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes ( KDIGO ) is one of the latest classifications of identifying AKI and is commonly used in various studies . 11 In 2016 , Ammar AS et al . in their study documented the reno-protective role of peri-operative dexmedetomidine infusion in cardiac surgery.4 The aim of this study is to use infusion of dexmedetomidine for renal protection in cardiac surgeries . PATIENTS AND METHODS : The aim of this study was to compare the changes in serum creatinine and urine output up to 48 hours of surgery in patients receiving dexmedetomidine infusion in addition to standard protocol as compared to the patients receiving standard protocol alone , and see if dexmedetomidine infusion reduced the incidence of Acute Kidney Injury ( AKI ) in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery ( CABG ) in a tertiary cardiac center of Karachi , Pakistan . This study , a randomized control trial , was conducted in the Department of Anesthesia & Intensive Care , National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases ( NICVD ) , Karachi , for a period of 6 months ( 01/08/2021 to 31/1/2022 ) , after approval from the ethical review committee of NICVD , Karachi . Sample size for the study was calculated using G * Power version 3.1.9.2 using method of sample size calculation for two-sided hypothesis testing of two independent mean . Taking mean and standard deviation of serum creatinine after 48 hours of CABG in Dexmedetomidine and control group reported by Ammar AS et al . [ 3 ] , at 5 % level of significance and 90 % power of test , the minimum required sample size of n=6 patients in each group was calculated . Considering the design effect , a sample size of 30 patients in each group was decided . N = 60 = 30 ( control ) + 30 ( treatment ) . Patients aged between 18 and 65 years , undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass grafting , and having ASA physical status class IV were included in the study . All patients with preoperative renal impairment ( elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels ) , on diuretic use , preexisting hepatic or pulmonary disease , peripheral vascular disease , previous cardiac surgery , emergency surgery , reopening surgeries , surgeries requiring a deep hypothermic circulatory arrest , preoperative use of inotropes or vasopressors , perioperative use of diuretics , perioperative episode of CPR , preoperative hemoglobin level less than 12 mg/dl , hematological disorders and with morbid obesity were excluded . Preoperatively , careful assessment of the cardiovascular system and investigations for the exclusion criteria and routine investigations which included complete blood count , coagulation profile , liver , and renal function tests , blood grouping , chest radiography , ECG , and echocardiography was done . On the day of surgery in the Operation Theatre ( OT ) , wide bore intravenous cannula ( 16G ) was inserted . Midazolam ( 0.01-0.02 mg/kg ) was given as premedication . Arterial cannulation was applied under local anesthesia in the radial artery . In the operative room , pulse oximeter ( SpO2 ) , a five-lead ECG , and invasive arterial blood pressure monitoring was applied . Doses of induction was adjusted according to the hemodynamics and myocardial function of the patient . Anesthesia was induced by propofol ( 1-5 mg/kg ) in addition to nalbuphine ( 0.1-0.2 mg/kg ) and atracurium ( 0.6 mg/kg ) . After preoxygenation for 3 min and finally , a suitable-sized endotracheal tube was inserted , and the patient was connected to IPPV . Anesthesia was maintained with an inhalational agent ( isoflurane ) ( 1-2 % ) in 100 % oxygen with the intent to maintain the mean arterial blood pressure and heart rate within 20 % of the baseline . Atracurium will be administered , at a dose of 0.1-0.2 mg/kg to maintain muscle relaxation throughout the procedure . We divided a total of 60 patients after informed and written consent , in to two groups using computer generated random allocation based on Bernoulli distribution with probability of success ( allocation of treatment group ) as 0.50 . In Dexmedetomidine Group ( Group D ) , patients received Dexmedetomidine infusion in addition to standard management protocol ( 0.4 μg/kg/h from induction of anesthesia till the end of surgery ) . Whereas , in Control Group ( Group C ) patients allocated to this group will receive standard management protocol alone . We have used Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes ( KDIGO ) protocol in order to evaluate incidence of acute kidney injury . This protocol defines acute kidney injury as increase in serum creatinine more than 0.3mg/dl within 48 hours OR urine volume of less than 0.5ml/kg/hr for 6 hours . 12 After induction of anesthesia , central venous line , urinary catheter , and temperature probe was inserted . Before skin incision additional nalbuphine was injected . Arterial blood gases , serum Na and K , hematocrit , and blood glucose was measured after induction of anesthesia , during CPB , after weaning from CPB and according to needs . Activated clotting time was measured at baseline , 3 min after heparin administration , during CPB , and finally after reversal of heparin with protamine sulfate . The primary outcome of the study was Serum Creatinine ( mg/dl ) which was measured before the surgery at baseline and then 48 hours after surgery . The secondary outcomes were incidence of urine output per hour for up to 48 hours after surgery , operative time from induction of anesthesia till skin closure , aortic cross-clamp time from application of aortic cross-clamping till aortic declamping , CPB time from connecting the patient to extracorporeal circulation till termination of CPB , duration of ICU stay from transferring the patient from the operating room to the ICU till patient discharge to the ward , episodes of bradycardia and hypotension , dosage of inotropics and hemoglobin levels at baseline and then up to 48 hours . . Hypotension was defined as decrease in systolic blood pressure < 90mmHg.12 Bradycardia was defined as heart rate less than 60 beats/min . 12 The staff involved in the clinical care and members of the study group obtaining the data were blinded to randomization for the period of data achievement and analysis . Group allocation was revealed after the final statistical analysis . Data was analyzed using IBM SPSS version 21 , data was summarized by computing descriptive statistics such as mean ± SD for continuous response variables ( including serum creatinine ( ng/dL ) , urine output , and creatinine clearance ) and frequency ( % ) for categorical response variables .

University of Montana,NCT05226299,Cough Desensitization Therapy: Pilot 2,University of Montana,1,1,Cough,Biological,Supra-threshold and progressive doses of diluted capsaicin via a dosimeter-controlled nebulizer,Treatment,Single,"The purpose of this study is to investigate a modified behavioral treatment for chronic cough due to cough hypersensitivity syndrome ( CHS ) . This type of CC is a non-productive cough that is due , in part , to over-expression of transient receptor potential vanilliod ( TRPV ) receptors in the airway epithelium , which contribute to a dry cough elicited by typically non-tussive stimuli ( e.g. , cold air , smells ) or by low doses of tussive stimuli ( e.g. , smoke ) . Currently available treatment options are limited to neuromodulator medications ( e.g. , gabapentin , amytriptiline ) and behavioral cough suppression therapy ( BCST ) , neither of which is 100 % effective . The primary component of BCST is teaching patients to suppress their cough in the presence of an urge-to-cough . Studies have confirmed a reduction in cough sensitivity ( as tested with inhaled capsaicin ) following 1-4 weeks of successful cough suppression . However , patients with severe CHS are not able to suppress their cough in the presence of uncontrollable environmental stimuli and , hence , do not respond well to the therapy . The purpose of this study is to determine the potential of treating CHS by implementing BCST while stimulating cough with progressive concentrations of inhaled diluted aerosolized capsaicin . The investigators hypothesize this treatment will result in a reduction in cough-reflex sensitivity , cough-related quality of life , and cough frequency .","The study will be a randomized , placebo-controlled , blinded study . It will take place in three phases , across 10 weeks . WEEK 1 : BASELINE TESTING AND TRAINING ( approximate time = 1 hour ) . Cough sensitivity testing : Standardized procedures that have been established and approved by the FDA will be used to determine cough sensitivity . Participants will inhale capsaicin vapor ( a known cough stimulant ) through a nebulizer with dosimeter , that delivers a specific dose of capsaicin in a mist form . They will inhale doubling doses of capsaicin mist from .49 micromolar to 1000 micromolar . The testing will be stopped when the investigators find the dose that causes five coughs or after giving the 1000 micromolar dose , whichever comes first . This testing will take approximately 30 minutes . Urge-to-cough ( UTC ) testing : Participants be asked to report their UTC on a scale from 0 ( no UTC ) to 10 ( maximum UTC ) after each mist of capsaicin and after being presented with the following stimulants/tasks that cause some people to cough : perfume , bleach , vinegar , wood chips , laundry soap , cleaning wipe , deep and fast breath through the mouth , sustained voicing , reading a 55 word passage , and yelling a short phrase ) . This testing will take about 10 minutes . Cough-related quality of life : Participants will complete the Leicester Cough Questionnaire which is a 23-item validated questionnaire designed to measure cough-related quality of life . It will take about 5 minutes . Visual analogue cough severity ( VAS ) : Participants will rate their cough severity on a visual analogue scale by placing a tick mark on a 100 mm line where 0 mm indicates `` no cough '' and 100 mm indicates `` worst possible cough '' . WEEKS 2-7 : TREATMENT . Participants will attend treatment sessions twice per week for up to six weeks . Participants will use the breathing strategies following inhalation of either the active substance ( experimental condition ) or repeated exposures to an inactive substance ( placebo condition ) . Participants will do this no more than twelve times per session . Each session will take 45-60 minutes . If a participant misses a treatment session , the investigators will attempt to re-schedule that session . Each participant must complete at least 10 treatment sessions to remain in the study .

Acute myocardial infarction is the leading cause of heart failure ( HF ) . It induces myocardial denervation predisposing to ventricular rhythm disorders and death . This denervation linked to infarction 's size occurs by direct ischaemic mechanisms during the initial coronary occlusion ( initially non-vascularised zone ) and secondarily by cardiac remodelling in the context of the heart failure ( HF ) . In usual practice , cardiac denervation which intensity is correlated with rhythm and mortality risks , can be evaluated by scintigraphy . In a murine reperfusion model of ischemia , the direct anti-inflammatory effect of colchicine reduces the size of the necrosis and improves post-ischemic remodeling .

Symptoms vary between people and may be mild to severe . common symptoms include painful and swollen joints , fever , chest pain , hair loss , mouth ulcers , swollen lymph nodes , feeling tired , and a red rash which is most commonly on the face . Often there are periods of illness , called flares , and periods of remission during which there are few symptoms.painless passage of blood or protein in the urine may often be the only presenting sign of kidney involvement . Acute or chronic renal impairment may develop with lupus nephritis , leading to acute or end-stage kidney failure . Because of early recognition and management of SLE , end-stage renal failure occurs in less than 5 % of cases ; except in the black population , where the risk is many times.Nephritis is the most severe manifestation of lupus . Between 1950s and 1970s , corticosteroids were used for the treatment of lupus nephritis ( LN ) , and using of cyclophosphamide ( CPM ) , improved the outcome dramatically with 5 years survival increasing from 17 % to 80 % .Subsequently , intravenous ( iv ) CPM became the standard of care in induction regimes ; however , ivCPM was associated with complications such as bladder toxicity , gonadal problems , and infections . To reduce the toxicity , low-dose of 500mg iv ( CPM ) every two weeks for six months showed equivalent efficacy and less side effect .

"National Cancer Institute, Egypt",NCT04813016,Intraperitoneal Tramadol Versus Dexmedetomedine for Analgesia After Abdominal Laparoscopic Cancer Surgeries,"National Cancer Institute, Egypt",2,1,Analgesia,Drug,Tramal 1,Treatment,Double,"Multiple modalities for postoperative analgesia after laparoscopic procedures has been used , of them intraperitoneal route ( IP ) was used to decrease the analgesic requirements . Both early and late bupivacaine and tramadol versus bupivacaine and dexmedetomedine will be tried to choose which is having a better analgesic profile .","Recently laparoscopic procedures have become popular and familiar to both surgeons and anesthetists . They have many advantages such as rapid postoperative recovery , low postoperative complication rates , early mobilization , and early home discharge ; consequently reduce hospital stay and costs . Although previous studies have been shown that laparoscopy is associated with less pain than laparotomy , it is not totally pain free . Some laparoscopic procedures for abdominal cancer surgeries has shown that there may be more intense pain and greater analgesic requirements in the immediate postoperative period than after open laparotomy . Thoroughly understanding the difference of pain generators in laparotomy than in laparoscopy gave some ideas helping in the control of each of them . While laparotomy results mainly in parietal pain , visceral pain remains predominantly in patients after laparoscopic surgeries resulting from the stretching of intra-abdominal cavity , peritoneal inflammation and phrenic nerve irritation caused by residual carbon dioxide in the peritoneal cavity resulting in postoperative abdominal and shoulder pain after laparoscopy . Hence , Intraperitoneal ( IP ) administration of some drugs can be effective for pain relief after laparoscopic surgery . The results have been variable as the published studies are heterogeneous and often lack appropriate controls . For that , no definitive conclusion can yet be made regarding its value and effectiveness . The α2-adrenergic agonist provides excellent sedation , anxiolysis , analgesia and sympatholysis . Of them , dexmedetomidine has become one of the frequently used drugs in anaesthesia aiming to its hemodynamic , sedative , anxiolytic , analgesic , neuroprotective and anaesthetic sparing effect . In addition , the high selectivity of dexmedetomidine to α2- receptors favored its widespread use in regional anaesthesia practice and local nerve blocks techniques . As noradrenergic neurons descending through the dorso-lateral funiculus from the brainstem to the dorsal horn significantly contribute in the modulation of pain by controlling impulse transmission ( descending inhibitory pathway ) . Adrenergic agonists , such as dexmedetomedine , possess significant antinociceptive activity by a central action on the brainstem and a spinal action on the substantia gelatinosa of the dorsal horn . Tramadol is a synthetic opioid pain medication used to treat moderate to moderately severe pain . It exerts its analgesic effects through a variety of different targets on the noradrenergic , serotoninergic and opioid receptors systems . It also exists as a racemic mixture , the positive enantiomer inhibits serotonin reuptake while the negative enantiomer inhibits noradrenaline re-uptake , by binding to and blocking the transporters . Finally , tramadol has also been shown to act as a serotonin releasing agent . Both enantiomers of tramadol are agonists of the μ-opioid receptor and its M1 metabolite , O-demethylate , which is also a μ-opioid receptor agonist but is 6 times more potent than tramadol itself . All these effects work synergistically to induce analgesia . The aim of this study is to examine and compare the effect of both early and late intraperitoneal bupivacaine/tramadol and bupivacaine/dexmedetomedine analgesia on the effectiveness of postoperative analgesia and the requirement of postoperative rescue analgesics after laparoscopic surgery for abdominal cancer surgeries .",2021-03-20,"June 1, 2022","Inclusion Criteria : ASA II or III .

"Insel Gruppe AG, University Hospital Bern",NCT04911660,Impact of the SGLT2 Inhibitor Empagliflozin on Urinary Supersaturations in Kidney Stone Formers,"Insel Gruppe AG, University Hospital Bern",2,1,Kidney Stone,Drug,Empagliflozin 25 MG,Prevention,Quadruple,"The aim of this study is to test the effect of a new drug on the composition of the urine in kidney stone patients . This new drug ( Jardiance® , substance : empagliflozin ) is currently approved in Switzerland for the treatment of patients with diabetes . Data from previous studies with and without diabetes suggest that it may have a beneficial effect on the composition of the urine and thereby reduce the risk of developing kidney stones .","Kidney stones - a global epidemic associated with obesity and diabetes Kidney stones are a worldwide healthcare problem with a current lifetime risk of ~18.8 % in men and ~9.4 % in women in Western civilizations . Recurrence rates are high , up to 40 % and 75 % at 5 and 10 years , respectively . Hospitalizations , surgery and lost work time associated with kidney stones cause enormous healthcare-related expenditures . Although kidney stone disease is traditionally considered an isolated renal disorder , there is overwhelming evidence that it is in fact a systemic disease . Arterial hypertension , obesity , diabetes mellitus , gouty diathesis , dyslipidemia , cardiovascular disease , chronic kidney disease and low bone mass are much more prevalent in kidney stone formers than in non-stone formers . It is currently unknown if stone disease is a cause of this co-morbidity per se or if it is a consequence of the same underlying conditions that lead to these disorders and kidney stones . Clearly , however , these co-morbidities contribute significantly to stone-related morbidity and mortality . The strong , positive and independent association of Body Mass Index ( BMI ) with kidney stone disease is well established . The magnitude of the increased risk is larger in women than in men . In addition to BMI , significant weight gain is also associated with a greater risk of developing symptomatic kidney stone disease in the future . In recent decades , the prevalence of both kidney stone disease and obesity increased significantly , irrespective of age , sex and race . In large cross-sectional analyses , the prevalence of both symptomatic and asymptomatic kidney stones increased proportionally with the number of metabolic syndrome features present . Both calcium and uric acid stones are associated with obesity , but the ratio of calcium stones to uric acid stones is lower in obese compared to non-obese stone formers , suggesting a disproportionate increase of uric acid stone disease in obesity . Absolute urinary excretion rates of stone formation promoters ( calcium , phosphate , oxalate and uric acid ) as well as urinary supersaturation ratios for calcium oxalate and uric acid are increased in obese individuals . In addition , there is a well documented negative association of BMI with urinary pH in both stone formers and non-stone formers , and low urinary pH is the main driver of uric acid stone formation . The latter may be explained by insulin resistance which affects the generation of renal ammonium by direct and indirect mechanisms . In contrast to urinary pH , urinary calcium excretion ( the main driver for calcium stone formation ) is not independently associated with BMI but rather due to other factors known to affect urinary calcium excretion ( e.g . secondary to increased sodium and animal protein intake ) . Supersaturation - driver of kidney stone formation Supersaturation , the presence of a material in solution at a concentration above its own solubility , is the driving force for crystallization and therefore kidney stone formation . Relevant supersaturations for kidney stones disease in humans include calcium oxalate , brushite ( calcium phosphate ) and uric acid . At a supersaturation 1 , crystals form . Urinary supersaturations calculated from ambulatory 24 h urine collections accurately reflect the long-term average supersaturation values in the urine and are highly correlated with the kidney stone composition encountered in the individual kidney stone former . Treatments that reduced stone events in Randomized Controlled Trials ( RCTs ) are highly correlated with reductions in urinary supersaturations . A recent analysis of a large 5-year kidney stone RCT revealed that as early as 1 week after randomization , every 10 % reduction of urinary calcium oxalate supersaturation from baseline was associated with an 8 % reduction in the risk of stone recurrence during follow-up . SGLT2 inhibitors - a promising new drug class for kidney stone formers Inhibitors of the sodium/glucose co-transporter isoform 2 ( SLC5A2 or SGLT2 ) belong to a new class of oral hypoglycemic drugs . SGLT2 resides in the brush border membrane of proximal tubular cells in the kidney and reabsorbs ~90 % of glucose filtered at the glomerulus . SGLT2 inhibitors block the physiological glucose reabsorption in the proximal tubule from the glomerular filtrate , thereby inducing significant glucosuria accompanied by a reduction of blood glucose levels . Empagliflozin , the clinically best characterized SGLT2 inhibitor to date , decreases cardiovascular mortality , death from any cause , hospitalizations for heart failure , decline of GFR and need for renal replacement therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes . Some of these findings were also observed with two other SGLT2 inhibitors canagliflozin and dapagliflozin in large outcome trials . Due to their unique mode of action , SGLT2 inhibitors induce weight loss , decrease blood pressure and increase urinary volume , the latter being a very effective measure to reduce stone recurrence . Driven by promising results in RCTs , SGLT2 inhibitors are currently widely tested in non-diabetics e.g . for the treatment of heart failure , non-diabetic kidney disease , arterial hypertension or obesity ( www.clinicaltrials.gov ) . The pleiotropic beneficial effects make SGLT2 inhibitors also a very attractive class of drugs for kidney stone formers , which often suffer concomitantly from arterial hypertension , CKD , obesity and diabetes . Effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on bone fractures , mineral metabolism and kidney stone events Therapy with SGLT2 inhibitors as monotherapy or add-on therapy to various glucose-lowering agents is generally well tolerated . An increased incidence of genital infections and ( although rare ) euglycemic ketoacidosis are known side effects of this new class of medications . The latter is mainly observed in type I diabetics and less frequently in type II diabetics . To the best of our knowledge , no cases of euglycemic ketoacidosis in individuals without diabetes treated with SGLT2 inhibitors have been reported . In the large canagliflozin outcome study CANVAS , an increased incidence of lower extremity amputations was noted . This adverse effect has not been reported with other SGLT2 inhibitors . In addition , both canagliflozin and dapagliflozin have been associated with an increased risk of bone fractures compared to placebo . In a short term study in healthy volunteers , canagliflozin increased serum phosphate , plasma fibroblast growth factor 23 ( FGF23 ) and plasma parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) and decreased the level of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. Similar results were obtained in individuals with diabetes treated with dapagliflozin . In contrast , pooled analyses of phase I , II and III trials of patients with type 2 diabetes treated with empagliflozin encompassing > 15'000 patient-years of exposure did not reveal an increased rate of bone fractures , alterations of blood electrolytes , PTH , 25-dihydroxyvitamin D or bone turnover markers . While blood electrolyte and mineral metabolism parameters in patients treated with SGLT2 inhibitors have been well studied in healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes , there is a lack of data on the impact of SGLT2 inhibition on urinary parameters , especially on parameters that influence the kidney stone formation rate . Also , to our knowledge , no studies have been conducted thus far with SGLT2 inhibitors in kidney stone formers . Interestingly , in pooled analyses of phase I , II and III trials , the rate of kidney stone events tended to be 30-50 % lower in patients treated with 10 or 25 mg empagliflozin versus placebo . However , detailed analyses for kidney stone events in empagliflozin outcome trials have not been reported . Reported stone event rates in these pooled empagliflozin trials ( 0.5 - 1/100 person years ) are similar to what has been observed in individuals with diabetes in three large prospective US cohorts ( Nurses ' Health Study I , the Nurses ' Health Study II and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study . In contrast , stone event rates are considerably ( 10 - 100-fold ) higher in patients with a history of kidney stone disease . RCTs testing dietary or pharmacologic measures for recurrence prevention typically included patients with stone event rates between 20 and 200 events/100 person-years . In summary , SGLT2 inhibitors represent a promising new drug class for kidney stone formers . Kidney stone formers are likely to profit from the metabolic and cardiovascular effects of SGLT2 inhibition . In addition , SGLT2 inhibitors may decrease the stone formation rate . Based on the overall experience thus far , empagliflozin seems to have by far the most favorable side effect profile . Clearly , there is a dire need for clinical studies with SGLT2 inhibitors in kidney stone formers .",2021-05-06,"May 11, 2023","Inclusion Criteria : Informed Consent as documented by signature Age between 18 and 74 years old One or more kidney stone event ( s ) in the past Any past kidney stone containing ≥ 80 % of calcium or ≥ 80 % of uric acid HbA1c < 6.5 % Exclusion Criteria : Patients with secondary causes of recurrent nephrolithiasis : Severe eating disorders ( anorexia or bulimia ) Chronic bowel disease , past intestinal or bariatric surgery Sarcoidosis Primary hyperparathyroidism Complete distal tubular acidosis Patients with the following medications : Anti-diabetic treatment ( insulin and non-insulin agents ) Patients not able or not willing to stop the following medication during the period of participation in the trial ( including a time window of 4 weeks wash out prior to randomization ) : Diuretics ( thiazide and loop diuretics ) Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors ( including topiramate ) Xanthine oxidase inhibitors Alkali , including potassium citrate or sodium bicarbonate Treatment with 1,25-OH Vitamin D ( calcitriol ) Calcium supplementation Bisphosphonates , Denosumab , Teriparatide Glucocorticoids Obstructive uropathy , if not treated successfully Genito-urinary infection , if not treated successfully Chronic kidney disease ( defined as CKD-EPI eGFR < 60 mL/min per 1.73 m2 body surface area ) Kidney transplant Pregnant and lactating women [ urine pregnancy test to be performed for women of childbearing potential ( defined as women who are not surgically sterilized/ hysterectomized , and/ or who are postmenopausal for less than 12 months ) ] or women of childbearing potential that refuse to use an effective contraceptive method ( birth control pill or IUD ) .

University of Ibadan,NCT04858074,Study to Investigate the Effect of Hypoestes Rosea Powder in Parkinson's Disease,University of Ibadan,1,1,Parkinson Disease,Drug,Hypoestoxide,Treatment,Double,"Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) is a progressive neurological disease characterized by resting tremors , limb stiffness , impaired balance , and slow movement . There is no known cure for PD although levo-3,4 dihydroxyphenylalanine ( L-DOPA ) and dopamine agonists are effective for improving PD symptoms in the early years following diagnosis . Hypoestes rosea is an evergreen shrub which has anti-inflammatory , anticancer and antimalarial properties . Recent studies showed that the active pharmaceutical ingredient ( API ) of Hypoestes rosea , Hypoestoxide , was effective in modifying disease progression in a transgenic mouse model of PD . The aim of this study is to determine the efficacy of Hypoestoxide , as contained in Hypoestes rosea dry leaf powder , in improving motor symptoms in consenting PD patients . The study design is a double-blind , placebo-controlled cross-over trial involving 30 patients with mild to moderate disease ( Stages 1-3 of Hoehn and Yahr scale over an 8-week period . The symptoms of the participants will be monitored using mobile phones with an established quantitative assessment tool , mPower2.0 , which was previously developed for monitoring symptoms and disease progression in PD patients . In addition , the motor examination component of the International Movement Disorders Society scale will be administered and correlated with the finding on the mobile phone . The outcome measure is an improvement in the motor variables of the study participants with a 10 % change from baseline over the 8 weeks of using Hypoestes .","Justification Age-associated disorders are increasing in many low- and middle-income countries due to population ageing and changing lifestyles . PD is a devastating condition which , in the advanced stages , is associated with immobility and uncontrollable tremors . Life then becomes miserable for the sufferers . Unfortunately , there is no cure for the disease except control of symptoms with medications . Any treatment combination that leads to better symptom control will go a long way in improving the quality of life for PD patients . This proof-of-concept study ( POC ) , if successful will give a new lease on life to PD patients . Hence it is considered worthwhile to treat PD patients with a new compound that is contained in a local plant that is readily available and holds promise for efficacy based on its mode of action specifically in reducing the formation of alpha synuclein which underlies the neuronal death in PD . OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY The aim of this study is to determine the efficacy of Hypoestoxide , as contained in Hypoestes rosea dry leaf powder ( PECKO-D ) , in improving motor symptoms in consenting PD patients over an 8-week period . Specific Objectives : • To determine the efficacy of Hypoestes rosea in improving motor performance of PD patients through traditional clinical evaluation , use of the selected components of the Motor Examination section of the International Movement Disorders Society Scale and ActiGraph wearable as a quantitative assessment tool . To document the side effect profile of the herbal product Methodology Study site : University College Hospital , Ibadan Study design : Single-center , randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial Study Type : Interventional ( Clinical Trial ) Allocation : Randomized Masking : Double Primary Purpose : Treatment Study participants : Patients with mild to moderate Parkinson 's disease symptoms . Eligibility Criteria Ages eligible for study : 30 years and older ( Adult , older adult ) Sexes Eligible for Study : All Accepts healthy volunteers : No Sample size : Being a proof-of-concept study , 19 PD patients will participate in this phase of the study Inclusion criteria : • Willing and able to give informed consent . Willingness and ability to comply with study requirements . PD diagnosis must be confirmed by bradykinesia plus one of the other cardinal signs ( resting tremor , rigidity , postural instability ) being present . Age > 30 years Men and women with mild to moderate PD : Hoehn and Yahr scale stages 1 - 3 . Participants may be on current therapeutic agents ( including levodopa , dopamine agonists , anticholinergics , amantadine or selegiline ) to treat PD symptoms at the time of enrollment and may remain on these agents throughout the 5-month study period . Women of childbearing potential ( i.e. , those not postmenopausal or surgically sterile ) may participate provided that they are using adequate birth control methods for the duration of the study . Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at baseline and be non-lactating . Exclusion : Subjects with advanced , severe disease , including those with dementia , severe osteoarthritis , allergies , stroke , and visual impairment . Presence of atypical PD syndromes due to drugs ( e.g. , metoclopramide , flunarizine ) , metabolic identified neurogenetic disorders ( e.g. , Wilson 's disease ) , encephalitis , or other degenerative diseases ( e.g. , progressive supranuclear palsy ) . Any clinically significant medical condition ( e.g. , active neoplasm , angina ) or laboratory abnormality , which would in the judgement of the investigator interfere with the subjects ' ability to participate in the study or be followed . Study Procedure : In this study , participants with mild to moderate PD , whether treated or untreated , will be randomized into one of two study arms following an initial baseline assessment to determine motor activity status of each participant as follows : Baseline Determination : Measurement of motor activities of all participants will be determined for 3 weeks while on regular PD medication ( s ) . The International Movement Disorders Society Scale - Motor Examination ( 10 selected items on Slowness , Posture , Tremor , Rigidity and Gait ) will be utilized for the quantitation of the motor activities . Drug arm : 15 patients will receive 4 capsules each containing 350 mg orally twice a day of PECKO-D Forte for 8 weeks as add-on therapy to patients ' regular PD medication ( s ) . Placebo arm : 15 participants will receive 4 capsules orally twice a day of United States Pharmacopeia ( USP ) -grade starch for 8 weeks as add-on to regular PD medication ( s ) . Wash-Out : Wash-out will be for a duration of 4 weeks in which patients assigned to both arms will take no capsules . The Switch over : Following the wash-out period , the PECKO-D Forte group will receive 4 capsules of USP-grade starch powder taken orally twice a day for 8 weeks . The placebo group will receive 4 capsules of PECKO-D forte taken orally twice a day for 8 weeks . Symptoms of the participants will be monitored using traditional clinical evaluation and daily using ActiGraph as an established quantitative assessment tool Once enrolled and given the ActiGraph kit , the participants will be asked to perform four ( 4 ) separate study tasks daily during the baseline determination period and throughout the treatment period : gait , tremor , tapping and balance . The International Movement Disorders Society Scale ( MDS ) - Motor Examination ( 10 selected items on Slowness , Posture , Tremor , Rigidity and Gait ) will be utilized for the quantitation of the motor activities . Data collected using the ActiGraph will be computer-analyzed and the MDS - Motor items will then be analyzed for significant changes in symptom severity relative to baseline status . Measurements : These include compliance , gait and balance measures before , during , and after treatment with PECKO-D . Participants will remain on their standard of care PD medications throughout the POC study and possible adverse side effects of the PEKO-D will be monitored . The following variables will be documented for each of these key measures : i ) Compliance : hours of device worn per day hours of device wear compliance per week hours of device worn per treatment period hours of device worn over the course of the study ii ) Gait measures : start time of walking period in milliseconds end time of walking period in milliseconds Duration of walking period in seconds Distance walked per walking period in meters Average gait speed per walking period in meters Number of steps per walking period Average stride period per walking period in seconds Freeze index per walking period iii ) Balance measures per detected walking period : X ( lateral ) axis variability in g Y ( forward ) axis variability in g Z ( vertical ) axis variability in g X-Y ( horizontal ) variability in g Freeze Index ( ratio ) OUTCOME MEASURE : 10 % Mean change in motor assessment parameters using the International Movement Disorders Society Scale - selected motor examination items while on the Hypoestes . This equates to 1- to 2-point improvement in motor performance over a 2-month period on Hypoestes in the absence of side effects which will be monitored using pharmacovigilance tools .

Posture : Instructions to examiner : Posture is assessed with the patient standing erect after arising from a chair , during walking , and while being tested for postural reflexes . If you notice poor posture , tell the patient to stand up straight and see if the posture improves ( see option 2 below ) . Rate the worst posture seen in these three observation points . Observe for flexion and side-to-side leaning . 0 : Normal : No problems . Slight : Not quite erect , but posture could be normal for older person . Mild : Definite flexion , scoliosis or leaning to one side , but patient can correct posture to normal posture when asked to do so . Moderate : Stooped posture , scoliosis or leaning to one side that can not be corrected volitionally to a normal posture by the patient . Severe : Flexion , scoliosis or leaning with extreme abnormality of posture . 2 . Global spontaneity of movement ( body bradykinesia ) Instructions to examiner : This global rating combines all observations on slowness , hesitancy , and small amplitude and poverty of movement in general , including a reduction of gesturing and of crossing the legs . This assessment is based on the examiner 's global impression after observing for spontaneous gestures while sitting , and the nature of arising and walking . 0 : Normal : No problems . Slight : Slight global slowness and poverty of spontaneous movements . Mild : Mild global slowness and poverty of spontaneous movements . Moderate : Moderate global slowness and poverty of spontaneous movements . Severe : Severe global slowness and poverty of spontaneous movements . 3 . Rigidity : Instructions to examiner : Rigidity is judged on slow passive movement of major joints with the patient in a relaxed position and the examiner manipulating the limbs and neck . First , test without an activation maneuver . Test and rate neck and each limb separately . For arms , test the wrist and elbow joints simultaneously . For legs , test the hip and knee joints simultaneously . If no rigidity is detected , use an activation maneuver such as tapping fingers , fist opening/closing , or heel tapping in a limb not being tested . Explain to the patient to go as limp as possible as you test for rigidity . 0 : Normal : No rigidity . Slight : Rigidity only detected with activation maneuver . Mild : Rigidity detected without the activation maneuver , but full range of motion is easily achieved . Moderate : Rigidity detected without the activation maneuver ; full range of motion is achieved with effort . Severe : Rigidity detected without the activation maneuver and full range of motion not achieved . 4 . Finger tapping : Instructions to examiner : Each hand is tested separately . Demonstrate the task , but do not continue to perform the task while the patient is being tested . Instruct the patient to tap the index finger on the thumb 10 times as quickly AND as big as possible . Rate each side separately , evaluating speed , amplitude , hesitations , halts , and decrementing amplitude . 0 : Normal : No problems . Slight : Any of the following : a ) the regular rhythm is broken with one or two interruptions or hesitations of the tapping movement ; b ) slight slowing ; c ) the amplitude decrements near the end of the 10 taps . Mild : Any of the following : a ) 3 to 5 interruptions during tapping ; b ) mild slowing ; c ) the amplitude decrements midway in the 10-tap sequence . Moderate : Any of the following : a ) more than 5 interruptions during tapping or at least one longer arrest ( freeze ) in ongoing movement ; b ) moderate slowing ; c ) the amplitude decrements starting after the 1st tap . Severe : Can not or can only barely perform the task because of slowing , interruptions , or decrements . 5 . Toe tapping Instructions to examiner : Have the patient sit in a straight-backed chair with arms , both feet on the floor . Test each foot separately . Demonstrate the task , but do not continue to perform the task while the patient is being tested . Instruct the patient to place the heel on the ground in a comfortable position and then tap the toes 10 times as big and as fast as possible . Rate each side separately , evaluating speed , amplitude , hesitations , halts , and decrementing amplitude . 0 : Normal : No problems . Slight : Any of the following : a ) the regular rhythm is broken with one or two interruptions or hesitations of the tapping movement ; b ) slight slowing ; c ) amplitude decrements near the end of the ten taps . Mild : Any of the following : a ) 3 to 5 interruptions during the tapping movements ; b ) mild slowing ; c ) amplitude decrements midway in the task . Moderate : Any of the following : a ) more than 5 interruptions during the tapping movements or at least one longer arrest ( freeze ) in ongoing movement ; b ) moderate slowing ; c ) amplitude decrements after the 1st tap . Severe : Can not or can only barely perform the task because of slowing , interruptions or decrements . 6 . Arising from a chair Instructions to examiner : Have the patient sit in a straight-backed chair with arms , with both feet on the floor and sitting back in the chair ( if the patient is not too short ) . Ask the patient to cross his/her arms across the chest and then to stand up . If the patient is not successful , repeat this attempt up to a maximum of two more times . If still unsuccessful , allow the patient to move forward in the chair to arise with arms folded across the chest . Allow only one attempt in this situation . If unsuccessful , allow the patient to push off using his/her hands on the arms of the chair . Allow a maximum of three trials of pushing off . If still not successful , assist the patient to arise . After the patient stands up , observe the posture . 0 : Normal : No problems . Able to arise quickly without hesitation . Slight : Arising is slower than normal ; or may need more than one attempt ; or may need to move forward in the chair to arise . No need to use the arms of the chair . Mild : Pushes self up from the arms of the chair without difficulty . Moderate : Needs to push off but tends to fall back ; or may have to try more than one time using the arms of the chair but can get up without help . Severe : Unable to arise without help . 7 . Gait Instructions to examiner : Testing gait is best performed by having the patient walking away from and towards the examiner so that both right and left sides of the body can be easily observed simultaneously . The patient should walk at least 10 meters ( 30 feet ) , then turn around and return to the examiner . This item measures multiple behaviors : stride amplitude , stride speed , height of foot lift , heel strike during walking , turning , and arm swing , but not freezing . Observe posture for item 1 0 : Normal : No problems . Slight : Independent walking with minor gait impairment . Mild : Independent walking but with substantial gait impairment . Moderate : Requires an assistance device for safe walking ( walking stick , walker ) but not a person . Severe : Can not walk at all or only with another person 's assistance . 8 . Postural Stability Instructions to examiner : The test examines the response to sudden body displacement produced by a quick , forceful pull on the shoulders while the patient is standing erect with eyes open and feet comfortably apart and parallel to each other . Test retropulsion . Stand behind the patient and instruct the patient on what is about to happen . Explain that s/he is allowed to take a step backwards to avoid falling . There should be a solid wall behind the examiner , at least 1-2 meters away to allow for the observation of the number of retropulsive steps . The first pull is an instructional demonstration and is purposely milder and not rated . The second time the shoulders are pulled briskly and forcefully towards the examiner with enough force to displace the center of gravity so that patient MUST take a step backwards . The examiner needs to be ready to catch the patient but must stand sufficiently back so as to allow enough room for the patient to take several steps to recover independently . Do not allow the patient to flex the body abnormally forward in anticipation of the pull . Observe for the number of steps backwards or falling . Up to and including two steps for recovery is considered normal , so abnormal ratings begin with three steps . If the patient fails to understand the test , the examiner can repeat the test so that the rating is based on an assessment that the examiner feels reflects the patient 's limitations rather than misunderstanding or lack of preparedness . Observe standing posture . 0 : Normal : No problems . Recovers with one or two steps . Slight : 3-5 steps , but subject recovers unaided . Mild : More than 5 steps , but subject recovers unaided . Moderate : Stands safely , but with absence of postural response ; falls if not caught by examiner . Severe : Very unstable , tends to lose balance spontaneously or with just a gentle pull on the shoulders . 9 . Rest tremor amplitude Instructions to examiner : This and the next item have been placed purposefully at the end of the examination to allow the rater to gather observations on rest tremor that may appear at any time during the exam , including when quietly sitting , during walking , and during activities when some body parts are moving but others are at rest . Score the maximum amplitude that is seen at any time as the final score . Rate only the amplitude and not the persistence or the intermittency of the tremor . As part of this rating , the patient should sit quietly in a chair with the hands placed on the arms of the chair ( not in the lap ) and the feet comfortably supported on the floor for 10 seconds with no other directives . Rest tremor is assessed separately for all four limbs and also for the lip/jaw . Rate only the maximum amplitude that is seen at any time as the final rating . Extremity ratings 0 : Normal : No tremor . Slight : < 1 cm in maximal amplitude . Mild : ≥ 1 cm but < 3 cm in maximal amplitude . Moderate : ≥ 3 cm but 75 % of the entire examination period . Total Score : ( out of 40 ) Additional measures include : Compliance , Gait and Balancing before , during , and after treatment with PECKO-D . Participants will remain on their standard of care PD medications throughout the POC study and possible adverse side effects of the PECKO-D will be monitored .

Research has shown that health-damaging behaviors such as a sedentary lifestyle can be attributed in part to a lack of self-control . There is some evidence that self-control strategies can be improved with targeted interventions . The overall aim of the proposed study is to test self-control as a behavior change mechanism for physical activity and to investigate whether a smartphone-based self-control intervention can increase physical activity among sedentary middle-aged and older adults . To test the effect of this self-control intervention , participants will be randomized into two conditions : The self-control treatment group and the control group . Both groups will track their daily physical activity using a Fitbit step counter over eight weeks . Additionally , the self-control intervention group will receive a 7-week smartphone-based self-control intervention to learn strategies how to potentiate desirable impulses or weaken undesirable ones . It is expected that the self-control treatment group will show greater increases in physical activity and that changes will last longer compared to the control group . Self-control is expected to mediate the relationship between condition and physical activity . It is predicted that the self-control treatment group will show greater changes in self-control compared to the control group and that people who increase more in self-control also increase more in their physical activity . Two versions of the MindHike smartphone application will be used to communicate with all participants . The self-control treatment group will receive a version delivering a self-control intervention . The control group will receive a minimal version without the interventional components .

NorthShore University HealthSystem,NCT04525898,Intraoperative Methadone for Postoperative Pain Control After Thoracic Surgery,NorthShore University HealthSystem,4,0,Postoperative Pain,Drug,Methadone,Prevention,Quadruple,"Pain following surgery continues to be an important adverse outcome that may impact postoperative recovery . Opioids like fentanyl and hydromorphone are the primary medications used to provide analgesia , but paradoxically , may actually worsen pain when administered in the operating room . Methadone is a unique opioid which has N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor blocking properties , which may prevent the development of opioid-induced tolerance and hyperalgesia ( increased sensitivity to pain induced by a drug ) . Studies have demonstrated that methadone reduces the need for analgesic medications and decreases pain after surgery . Furthermore , the addition of methadone to a standard anesthetic has been demonstrated to increase patient satisfaction with pain management and reduce the need for opioid analgesic medications during the first month after surgery . Some investigators have described methadone as a `` opioid-sparing opioid '' and recommended its use as part of a multimodal pain management strategy . There is a growing interest in reducing the use of traditional opioids in the operating room . The aim of this clinical trial is to compare pain scores and analgesic requirements in two groups of patients ; one group will be randomized to receive a small dose of methadone at the start of surgery . The other group will be randomized to receive an equal volume of saline ( salt water-control group ) at the start of surgery . We hypothesize that patients randomized to be administered methadone at the start of surgery will have less postoperative pain and may require lower doses of pain medications than those given saline-control ..","Despite the development of a number of treatment strategies for pain after surgery , many patients continue to experience moderate-to-severe pain in the early postoperative period . Traditionally , opioids are the primary method of providing analgesia in the operating room , postanesthesia care unit ( PACU ) , intensive care unit , and surgical wards . However , a number of potentially life-threatening complications can develop following opioid administration including severe respiratory depression . In addition , studies have demonstrated an association between the dose of opioid used in the operating room and the intensity of pain after following surgery ; paradoxically , the greater the dose of opioid administered , the higher the reported pain scores are in the early recovery period . This is likely secondary to two interrelated phenomena : tolerance and opioid-induced hyperalgesia . Tolerance , a pharmacologic concept , can develop acutely after a single dose of opioid in the operating room . This can result in increased requirements for postoperative pain medications . Opioid-induced hyperalgesia ( OIH ) , a clinical concept , involves enhancement of existent pain stimuli ( normally minimally painful incisions may feel much worse ) and facilitation of chronic pain development . Therefore , it may be beneficial to use lower doses of intraoperative opioids on all surgical patients . Using a multimodal approach to pain management has been demonstrated to reduce the requirements for postoperative analgesic agents and improve pain scores . A number of different agents have been investigated including gabapentinoids , lidocaine , steroids , and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents . Although it is an opioid , another medication that may be considered as part of a multimodal treatment of pain is methadone . Methadone has several unique properties that may beneficially impact the recovery of the surgical patient . It has been extensively studied as an agent to provide prolonged postoperative analgesia . When larger doses of methadone have been administered intravenously at induction of anesthesia , a median duration of analgesia lasting more than 25 hours has been reported . In patients undergoing abdominal , orthopedic , or gynecologic surgery , the use of a single dose of methadone ( 20 mg or 0.2-0.3 mg/kg ) before surgical incision resulted in improved analgesia for the first 24-48 hours after surgery , when compared to other intraoperative opioids . In these investigations , patients in the methadone groups required significantly less postoperative pain medication and reported lower pain scores during the first or second postoperative days . However , other investigations have demonstrated significant analgesic effects of smaller doses of methadone ( 0.1 to 0.15 mg/kg ) . Furthermore , reductions in pain scores and need for oral opioid medications for the first 30 postoperative days have been observed in surgical patients administered 0.15 mg/kg of methadone . In addition to a long plasma half-life , methadone has other properties which may be advantageous in surgical patients . Recent evidence has demonstrated that methadone has the ability to block N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA ) receptors . NMDA receptors have been implicated in the development of postoperative hyperalgesia ( amplification of pain stimuli ) , and techniques which block NMBA receptors reduce pain . Therefore , methadone may attenuate postoperative pain via this additional mechanism . NMDA receptor stimulation is also thought to play an important role in the development of chronic pain . Although unproven , it has been hypothesized that methadone may reduce the risk of development of chronic postsurgical pain via inhibition of NMDA receptors . No adverse events directly attributable to methadone have been reported in any of the published clinical trials . The aim of this randomized clinical investigation is to assess two cohorts of patients ; one group will receive a dose of methadone at induction of anesthesia ( 0.15 mg/kg ideal body weight ( IBW ) -methadone group ) ) . The other group will be randomized to be administered an equal volume of saline in an identical appearing syringe ( control group ) .. The primary endpoint will be pain scores 24 hours after surgery . Secondary endpoints will include pain scores on arrival and discharge from the postanesthesia care unit ( PACU ) , and at 2 , 6 , 24 , 48 , and 72 hours ( if the patient remains in the hospital ) after surgery . Analgesic requirements in the PACU and surgical wards will be assessed . In addition , the incidence of potential methadone-related side effects will be measured ( delayed emergence , nausea and vomiting , respiratory depression ) ) . Furthermore , methadone has been documented to potentially reduce the incidence of chronic postsurgical pain . A survey with a self-addressed stamped envelope will be provided to patients at 1 , 3 , 6 , and 12 months after surgery to complete to assess the effect of methadone on this important outcome variable .",2020-02-12,"December 6, 2021","Inclusion Criteria : Patients undergoing any thoracoscopic procedure under general anesthesia Exclusion Criteria : American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status 4 or 5 , active heart failure , significant liver disease , previous adverse reactions to methadone , preoperative recent history of opioid or alcohol abuse , renal failure , or inability to comprehend the English language",40,0,18 Years,80 Years

University of Cape Town,NCT04523090,Catalysing the Containment of COVID-19,University of Cape Town,2,0,COVID-19,Drug,Nitazoxanide,Treatment,Triple,"COVID-19 due to SARS-CoV-2 infection is a rapidly escalating global pandemic for which there is no proven effective treatment . COVID-19 is multi-dimensional disease caused by viral cytopathic effects and host-mediated immunopathology . Therapeutic approaches should logically be based on interventions that have direct anti-viral effects and favourably modulate the host immune response . Thus , an optimal drug regimen in ambulatory patients should collectively ( i ) target and reduce viral replication , ( ii ) upregulate host innate immune anti-viral responses , ( iii ) have favourable immunomodulatory properties , and ( iv ) minimise disease progression to hospitalisation thus circumventing the 'cytokine storm ' that likely underpins ARDS and multi-organ failure . Nitazoxanide ( NTZ ) is an antiprotozoal drug that is FDA-approved for treating Cryptosporidium and Giardia and has an excellent safety record for a variety of indications , but primarily as an anti-parasitic agent . It has proven broad anti-viral activity as it amplifies cytoplasmic RNA sensing , potently augments type I interferon and autophagy-mediated anti-viral responses , has immunomodulatory properties e.g inhibits macrophage IL-6 production , and interferes with SARS-CoV-2 glycosylation . It has been shown to have anti-viral activity against several viruses including Ebola , influenza , hepatitis B and C , rotavirus and norovirus . With regard to respiratory viral infections , NTZ was evaluated in uncomplicated influenza and demonstrated a reduction in the median time to symptom recovery . By contrast , NTZ failed to show benefit in hospitalised patients with severe influenza suggesting that , as with oseltamivir ( Tamiflu ) , it likely needs to be administered early in the course of the disease . NTZ has proven in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 . NTZ inhibited the SARS-CoV-2 at a low-micromolar concentrations and in vivo evaluation in patients with COVID-19 has been strongly recommended . NTZ has an excellent drug-drug interaction profile . No clinically significant interactions are expected with commonly used antihypertensive agents , anti-diabetics drugs , antiretroviral agents , steroids or commonly prescribed analgesics/anti-inflammatory agents . The investigators propose NTZ for the treatment of mild COVID-19 in non-hospitalised patients with HIV co-infection and/or enhanced risk for progression to severe disease ( age > 35 years and/or with comorbidity ) . The investigators will perform a randomised controlled trial enrolling 440 patients with mild disease . The primary outcome measure will be the proportion progressing to severe disease ( hospitalisation ) based on the WHO clinical progression scale ( stage 4 and beyond ) . Secondary outcome measures will include disease rates in contacts and effect on viral load , productive infectiousness using viral cultures , and ability to abrogate the generation of infectious aerosols using novel cough aerosol sampling technology . Recruitment is stratified and thus the study is powered to detect progression to severe disease in HIV-infected persons .","COVID-19 that is caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection is a rapidly escalating global pandemic ( 9 ) . The pandemic is on an upward and escalating trajectory in most countries though some countries like China have shown a substantial decrease in the number of new cases being recorded . It is unclear if there will be a second wave of the epidemic . Most cases of COVID-19 are either asymptomatic or have minimal symptoms ( ~80 % ) and act as carriers for disease transmission . Recent longitudinal studies indicate that the SARS-COV-2 viral load in the pharynx is highest during the prodromal phase of COVID-19 . Thus , early therapeutic intervention , prior to respiratory tract dissemination and disease amplification , is likely to be a promising strategy . Although such persons are advised to be in self isolation , many , especially in resource-poor settings ( due to several factors including poverty , overcrowding , environmental conditions , personal beliefs , stigma and human fallibility ) , continue to have contact with others thus fuelling the epidemic . Therefore , reducing the period of infectiousness in ambulatory patients will have major public health impact by shortening the epidemic , thereby reducing morbidity and mortality . Retarding the progression of the 15 to 20 % that will develop more severe disease will have benefits for the public health system , which is struggling to cope with a surge in cases and will thus have a likely impact on mortality . Thus , therapeutic agents that can reduce viral load , viral shedding , the duration of illness and progression to severe disease are urgently needed . It is important to note that HIV-infected persons and certain sub-groups ( including those > 35 years of age , and with comorbidities like diabetes and hypertension etc . ) may have 'enhanced risk ' of disease progression . Collectively such persons would constitute an enhanced risk group and are at the highest risk of disease progression . The risk of disease progression in HIV-infected persons and whether they will respond to the NTZ intervention to the same extent as HIV uninfected persons remains unknown . NTZ is licensed in the USA for treatment of diarrhoea caused by Cryptosporidium parvum and Giardia lamblia . NTZ is a pro-drug for tizoxanide , which also has broad spectrum antiviral properties , has many viral indications and shows promising pharmacodynamics against Coronaviridae . NTZ was identified as a first-in-class broad-spectrum antiviral drug and has been repurposed for the treatment of influenza . In vitro studies evaluating tizoxanide , the active circulating metabolite of NTZ , inhibits the replication of broad range of influenza A and B , HIN1 , H3N2 , H3N2V , H3N8 , H5N9 , H7N1 and oseltamivir resistant strain and coronaviruses . It has been shown to have anti-viral activity against several viruses including Ebola , hepatitis B and C , rotavirus and norovirus . A Phase 2b/3 clinical trial recently published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases found that oral administration of NTZ slow release formulation 600 mg twice daily for five days reduced the duration of clinical symptoms and reduced viral shedding compared to placebo in persons with laboratory-confirmed influenza . These dosages are suitable for treating viral respiratory infections caused by influenza and other viruses as in vitro IC50s are typically between 0.1 and 1ug/mL . The same study also suggested a potential benefit for subjects with influenza-like illness who did not have influenza or other documented respiratory viral infection . The broad-spectrum antiviral activity of tizoxanide is attributed to interference with host regulated pathways involved in viral replication . These pathways include IFN and mTOR1 ( autophagy ) signalling pathways . NTZ upregulates the innate anti-viral mechanisms by broadly amplifying cytoplasmic RNA sensing and type I IFN pathways . It is also a potent driver of autophagy , an antiviral and anti-bacterial mechanism . Thus , NTZ interferes with the viral infection by upregulating the precise host mechanisms that viruses target to bypass host cellular defences . Additionally , NTZ inhibits replication of a broad range of influenza viruses , including neuraminidase inhibitor-resistant strains by blocking the maturation of viral haemagglutinin at the post-translational level . NTZ impairs intracellular trafficking and insertion of viral haemagglutinin into the host plasma membrane . In cell culture studies , NTZ acts synergistically with neuraminidase inhibitors . NTZ may inhibit the glycosylation of the SARS-CoV-2 , similar to its action on the hemagglutinin antigen of the influenza virus . Additionally , NTZ also exhibits inhibitory activity against IL-6 production from murine macrophages both in vitro and in vivo . Moreover , there is a good possibility that diseases associated with IL-6 overproduction ( cytokine storm ) like SARS-CoV-2 could be ameliorated by NTZ . NTZ may be useful for the early treatment of COVID-19 when viral load is at its highest in the pharynx ; and could serve to limit viral shedding thus significantly reducing disease transmission . In the same group it may retard progression to severe disease . Although only 15 to 20 % of patients with COVID-19 may develop severe disease , large numbers of such patients will totally overwhelm healthcare systems as currently being experienced in the USA and the Western Cape province of South Africa . Thus , whether NTZ is useful in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 disease remains unclarified and urgently needs to be addressed . Unreliability with using duration of illness ( pre-symptomatic period is variable and symptom onset is subject to substantial recall bias ) and viral load ( may be different in different anatomical locations and will depend on tolerance and host immunity ) as proxy measures means that the investigators have to embark on a phase IIB/III study to determine whether NTZ effects a clinically meaningful outcome . Study design : A single-stage , double-blinded , randomised , placebo-controlled trial . Primary aim : To evaluate the effectiveness of nitazoxanide ( NTZ ) in reducing the progression from mild to severe COVID-19 in non-hospitalised patients . Significance and impact : The investigators will perform a randomised placebo-controlled trial recruiting 440 mildly symptomatic non-hospitalised COVID-19 patients at multiple sites from 4 cities in South Africa . The primary outcome measure will be time-specific ( 30- and 60-day ) disease severity based on the WHO clinical progression scale . This will have implications for disease transmission and amplification of the epidemic . The rate of progression to severe disease will determine hospitalisation rates , morbidity , and mortality . It will also have implications for reducing healthcare burden , costs and improving healthcare worker safety . The investigators predict that the progression to severe disease ( need for presentation or admission to hospital ) will be reduced with NTZ . As disease progression will more likely occur in those who are HIV-infected or with enhanced risk ( older patients or those with immunosuppression ) , the investigators will stratify randomisation for HIV-infected and enhanced risk patients .",2020-08-20,"August 12, 2022","Inclusion Criteria : Adults > 18 years of age .

Medication assisted treatment , including methadone and buprenorphine , is the standard of care for the treatment of opioid use disorder ( OUD ) . However , chronic pain can reduce treatment efficacy during medication assisted treatment and is associated with illicit substance relapse , dropout , and subsequent overdose . Mechanisms by which chronic pain may influence the impulsive decision making ( e.g. , drug relapse ) in persons with OUD have not been well characterized . A better understanding is needed of decision-making in this population . Two factors that can influence decisions to use drugs are impulsivity and acute opioid withdrawal . This proposal will test how chronic pain is associated with increases in impulsive decision making in OUD , whether impulsive decision making is greater when undergoing opioid withdrawal , and how catastrophizing may modify the association between withdrawal and impulsive decision making in patients with chronic pain and OUD . An ideal population for this developmental research project are methadone maintained patients , who show high treatment attendance rates and will therefore assure study efficiency and reliable completion .",This is an outpatient Phase 1 clinical trial investigating the effect of naloxone precipitated withdrawal on delay discounting . Eligible participants will undergo two experimental sessions presented in random order .

Multiple studies have found that the hyperinflammatory immune response induced by SARS-CoV-2 is one of the main causes of severity and death in infected patients . In severe COVID-19 patients , an association was found between pneumonitis and/or ARDS ( Acute Severe Respiratory Syndrome ) , increased serum levels of cytokines and chemokines , extensive lung damage and microthrombosis . Studies of both gene expression in lungs and blood cytokines and chemokines have related chemokine signaling clusters with COVID-19 severity , being CCL3 , CCL4 and CCL7 ( CC chemokine ligands 3 , 4 and 7 ) particularly interesting . All these are CCR5 ( CC chemokine receptor 5 ) ligands . A strategy to modulate activation and trafficking of leukocytes to the lungs is by blocking CCR5 by using maraviroc ( MVC ) , which has shown capable of modulating conditions of generalized inflammation . Along with a good regulation of the immune response , an antiviral that helps to reduce the viral load must be considered . Favipiravir ( FPV ) has shown to be capable to reduce the time of viral clearance by half . Hence , we propose that the conjoint use of MVC and FPV could help to reduce the progression of severe hospitalized COVID-19 patients to critical by decreasing the percentage of patients in need of mechanical respiratory support or death by at least 30 % . This is a randomized , controlled clinical trial that besides evaluating the safety and efficacy of MVC+FPV to avoid progression in severe COVID-19 patients as a primary endpoint , is also aimed at other secondary endpoints : A ) Evaluate the activation of CCR5 in peripheral blood lymphocytes , monocytes , and neutrophils . B ) Find possible modifications in the ongoing chemokine and cytokine storm in serum , particularly IL-6 , IL-1b , ( interleukins 6 and 1 beta ) TNF ( tumor necrosis factor ) , IFNa , IFNg ( interferons alpha and gamma ) , VEGF ( vascular endothelial growth factor ) , CXCL10 ( CXC chemokine ligand 10 ) , CCL7 , CCL3 , and CCL5 ( CC chemokine ligands 7 , 3 and 5 ) , C ) Search for alterations in the patterns of activation , trafficking , and exhaustion of peripheral blood lymphocytes , monocytes and neutrophils , and D ) Determine if it has an effect in viral loads in saliva . 100 severe patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 will be randomized in 4 treatment arms : Arm A : Currently used therapy ( CT ) only , Enoxaparin , dexamethasone , and antibiotics if associated bacteremia is present , as per currently used at Hospital General de México `` Dr. Eduardo Liceaga '' ) .

Pennington Biomedical Research Center,NCT04530747,Metabolic Effects of Metformin Therapy in Obstructive Sleep Apnea,Pennington Biomedical Research Center,1,0,"Sleep Apnea, Obstructive",Drug,Metformin + PAP,Prevention,Quadruple,The purpose of the study is to see if metformin improves metabolism in patients with obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) using positive airway pressure ( PAP ) therapy . Metformin is approved by the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) for the treatment and prevention of diabetes . It is not approved for use in patients with OSA .,"Positive airway pressure ( PAP ) is standard therapy for obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) but has shown mixed results for improvement of insulin sensitivity and does not reduce cardiovascular ( CV ) events and mortality , even in patients with established CV disease . Hence , eliminating intermittent hypoxia alone with standard PAP therapy may not be sufficient to restore metabolism . Additional adjunct strategies ( such as metformin ) known to improve metabolism may be required to reduce metabolic burden and CV risk in OSA patients . The aim of this study is to examine the longitudinal changes in metabolism of OSA patients receiving both PAP and metformin treatment . The MET-OSA study will last about 4 months . After screening the participants to determine eligibility , baseline study measures will be obtained and the participants will be provided with standard PAP for OSA treatment . Participants will also be randomized to receive either placebo or metformin treatment for 3 months . Compliance to study drug will be determined during monthly follow-up visits .

Data entery specialist Statistical Analysis Sample size : 1500 volanteer ( 750 in each group ) . We are planning a study of independent 2 groups with 1 control ( s ) per case . Prior data indicate that the incidence of infection among controls is 15 % . If the true incidence of infection rate for experimental subjects is 10 % , we will need to study 686 experimental subjects and 686 control subjects to be able to reject the null hypothesis that the failure rates for experimental and control subjects are equal with probability ( power ) 0.8 . The Type I error probability associated with this test of this null hypothesis is 0.05 . Based on this calculation , a total of 750 subject in each group will be calculated to compensate for the droup outs . Statistical methods The data will be analyzed by SPSS V. 23 ( SPSS Inc . Released 2015 . IBM SPSS statistics for windows , version 23.0 , Armnok , NY : IBM Corp. ) . Data will be expressed in Number ( No ) , percentage ( % ) mean ( x̅ ) , and standard deviation ( SD ) . OneWay ANOVA is a test of significance that will be used for comparison of quantitative variables of normally distributed data . In contrast , the Kruskal-Wallis test will be used for the comparison of quantitative variables between three groups of not normally distributed data . Primary efficacy analysis will be on an intention-to-treat basis and will include all the persons who will be randomized . The time to clinical improvement will be described by Kaplan-Meier plot and compared with a log-rank test . Hazard ratios with 95 % confidence intervals will be calculated through the Cox proportional-hazards model . Equipment All participating centers are well equipped with the necessary equipment ; either for patients care , laboratory testing , or radiology services . Cofedinitiality : A . Protection of Subject Privacy - All volunteers are assured of their confidentiality both verbally and in the informed consent forms . The facilities are strictly limited to the staff of the research institution , clinics and to research volunteers . This is accomplished by a variety of stringent security measures . All medical records are to be stored in locked areas . Access to these areas is limited to the clinical support staff and the PI of the study . Volunteers ' medical records are filed according to ID numbers . All forms on the chart , with the exception of consent form , display only the ID number . B . Database Protection - Electronic data storage is similarly restricted with only the data management staff having access to databases containing confidential clinical records , i.e . those containing name or other identifying information . C. Confidentiality during AE Reporting - Adverse events will be reported to the study PI , DSMB and notified to the IRB throughout the trial .

In this study , a combination of two drugs that have been shown to be effective against the germ that causes COVID-19 in the laboratory will be tested in patients diagnosed with moderate to severe COVID-19 . One of the drugs is called nitazoxanide and the second is atazanavir/ritonavir . Nitazoxanide has been used for the treatment of diarrhea since 2004 while atazanavir/ritonavir was approved for HIV treatment in 2003 . They are known to be safe in humans . In this pilot study , 98 COVID-19 patients will be recruited into two groups . The 49 patients in group 1 will receive the standard of care determined by their primary care providers while the 49 patients in group 2 will receive both the standard of care combined with the two study drugs . Patients in group 2 will receive the study drugs for 14 days and all patients will be monitored for a total of 28 days . The time it takes for the germ that causes COVID-19 to be completely removed from the body ( in nasal secretions ) and the time to clinical improvement will be monitored in all patients and compared between the two groups .","COVID-19 caused by a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( SARS-CoV-2 ) is an unprecedented global public health challenge which as at July 1 , 2020 has spread to over 210 countries with over 10.6 million cases resulting in 514,808 deaths . More than 1500 clinical trials are currently ongoing in an unprecedented global search for potential therapeutics and vaccines . With increasing number of cases reported in low- and middle-income countries and and the possibility of a second wave of infections in countries where the pandemic appears to have slowed , studies to investigate promising therapies are urgently needed , especially those that can significantly reduce time to viral clearance and mortality . Shortening SARS-CoV-2 clearance time will lower treatment cost and reduce the economic impact of the pandemic . The purpose of this phase 2 trial is to investigate the efficacy and safety of repurposed antiprotozoal and antiretroviral drugs , nitazoxanide and atazanavir/ritonavir , in achievement of SARS-CoV-2 PCR negativity and shorten the time to clinical improvement in patients diagnosed with moderate to severe COVID-19 . The selection of candidates for this COVID-19 drug repurposing trial was guided by three pharmacological considerations : ( 1 ) demonstration of in-vitro anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity at doses shown or predicted to be tolerated by humans , ( 2 ) the feasibility of achieving effective concentration in relevant compartments , and ( 3 ) established human safety record . This is a pilot phase 2 , open label randomized controlled trial . A total of 98 patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis ( defined as SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) positive nasopharyngeal swab ) will be recruited from participating treatment centres . Participants will be randomised to receive either the standard of care ( SOC ) plus nitazoxanide for 14 days , starting from day 1 or the SOC alone for 14 days . Participants will be recruited within 2 days of admission into COVID-19 treatment centre . Before enrollment , they will be given adequate information about the trial , opportunity to ask questions , and sufficient time to consider participation . Before any screening procedures , a written consent will be obtained from each eligible subject who agrees to participate in the trial . Participants will then be randomly allocated 1:1 to receive either the SOC alone ( control group ) or SOC plus study drug ( intervention group ) . Parallel assignment will be used to prevent sample size imbalance between groups and control for important covariates ( e.g . age , comorbidities , gender ) that may affect trial results . Participants in the intervention group will receive 1000 mg nitazoxanide ( two tablets of 500 mg each ) with meal two times daily ( 8 am and 8 pm ) and one tablet of 300/100 mg atazanavir/ritonavir with meal once daily ( 8 pm ) in addition SOC . Participants in the control arm will receive the SOC alone . SOC will be as determined by the clinical team at the treatment centres in line with the current National Interim Guidelines for Clinical Management of COVID-19 . The treatment duration for participants in the intervention group will be 14 days . However , follow up will continue until day 28 after study entry at the end of which all participants will exit the study . Evaluations at follow up visits will include daily symptoms monitoring using inFLUenza Patient-Reported Outcome ( FLU-PRO ) questionnaire , daily vitals , daily clinical improvement assessment , and swab and/or sputum collection for SARS-CoV-2 on days 2 , 4 , 6 , 7 , 14 , and 28 . Sample size estimation is based on the assumption that an improvement of at least 60-80 % in time to SARS-CoV-2 PCR negativity and symptoms resolution can be achieved in the intervention group compared with the control group . Hence , a total sample size of 89 will provide at least 80 % power to show or exclude 60 % improvement in time to SARS-CoV-2 PCR negativity . This assumes a two-sided and 5 % type 1 error rate . Therefore , providing for a 10 % loss to follow up rate , a total of 98 patients will be recruited .",2020-07-03,"February 14, 2022","Inclusion Criteria : Willingness and ability to provide written informed consent At least 18 and not more than 75 years of age at study entry SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by PCR test within 4 days before randomization Currently symptomatic ( fever or chills , cough , myalgia , sore throat , shortness of breath , or new onset of anosmia or ageusia ) and at COVID-19 isolation and treatment centre Exclusion Criteria : Inability to take orally administered medication or food Known hypersensitivity to study medication Pregnant or lactating ( unless practicing exclusive replacement feeding for the entire study duration ) Participation in any other interventional trial for COVID-19 ( observational study co-enrollment allowed ) Concurrent treatment with other agents with actual or possible direct-acting antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 less than 24 hours prior to study drug dosing Concurrent use of agents with known or uncertain interaction with study drugs , including ritonavir Requiring mechanical ventilation at screening Alanine Aminotransferase ( ALT ) or aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) above 5 times upper limit of normal ( ULN ) Creatinine clearance below 50 mL/min using the Cockcroft-Gault formula for participants above 18 years of age",57,0,18 Years,75 Years
University of Kentucky,NCT04454281,Topical Naloxone to Diagnose Ocular Pain,Seema Capoor,1,1,Dry Eye Syndromes,Drug,Naloxone Hydrochloride 0.4 MG/ML,Diagnostic,Triple,Chronic ocular neuropathic pain may be misdiagnosed as dry eye disease . Our study aims to identify a population with previous monocular trauma and dry eye symptoms and differentiate neuropathic from dry eye pain using topical corneal naloxone hydrochloride .,"Dry eye is a ubiquitous and debilitating ocular condition that affects tens of millions in the United States ( DEWS , 2007 ) . However , there is increasing evidence that the symptoms of dry eye overlap with the distinct condition of ocular neuropathic pain , and that many patients given a dry eye diagnosis are mislabeled ( Galor , 2017 ) . These shared symptoms include but are not limited to : hypoesthesia , hyperalgesia , and allodynia . According to the 2017 DEWS II ( Dry Eye Workshop ) pain and sensation report by the Tear Film and Ocular Surface Society , neuropathic pain can manifest itself in the eye and may present similarly to dry eye , but should not be classified as such ( Belmonte , 2017 ) . Our study aims to further characterize this distinction by translating the rodent model of latent sensitization to the human eye . Latent sensitization is a model of chronic pain that reproduces both its episodic nature and its sensitivity to stress . It can be induced by an array of insults and follows a characteristic time course in which a hyperalgesic pain phase is followed by pain remission phase . Of clinical relevance , administration of mu-opioid antagonists ( i.e . naloxone ) during the remission phase reinstates animal pain behavior and physiologic reflexes to peak levels seen in the hyperalgesia phase ( Marvizon , 2015 ) . This phenomenon suggests that the animals are in a state of latent sensitization that can be unmasked by blocking the activity of the opioid signaling pathway through compounds like naloxone hydrochloride . Furthermore , the undulating course of chronic pain syndromes can be mimicked by introducing environmental and physical stressors that trigger and exacerbate pain states ( Marvizon , 2015 ) . Neuropathic pain is a common cause of chronic pain . It is defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain as pain that arises as a direct consequence of a lesion or disease affecting the somatosensory system . In contrast , nociceptive pain is produced by the normal function of nociceptors . Hence , neuropathic lesions do not necessarily involve the nociceptive pathway ; instead , they can involve other somatosensory pathways including tactile , mechanical , and thermal pathways . These lesions manifest allodynia-a central pain sensation following a normally non-painful stimuli and a clinical hallmark of neuropathic pain . In the eye , allodynia may manifest as non-specific dry-eye-like-symptoms to stimuli including wind , temperature change , and humidity ( Galor , 2017 ) . Hyperalgesia is a heightened pain sensation to a normally painful stimulus and is another hallmark of neuropathic pain . Importantly , hyperalgesia is a symptom of both neuropathic and nociceptive pain , however the pathophysiologies are distinct . Neuropathic hyperalgesia is a sustained phenomenon that arises from neuronal remodeling and sensitization of nociceptive peripheral and/or central nerves . In distinction , nociceptive hyperalgesia arises from inflammatory cytokine mediators that sensitize nociceptors and resolves after the conclusion of inflammation . Given all of this , it can be difficult to clinically differentiate the two forms of hyperalgesia ; similarly , it can be difficult to differentiate between neuropathic and nociceptive pain . In our murine model ( Cho , 2019 ) , we study latent sensitization of the eye after injuring the cornea with an alkali solution . We find that pain behavior ( quantified by the number of eye wipes in thirty seconds after the topical administration of 2M NaCl to the corneal surface ) peaks at day 10 post injury and returns to baseline by day 14 post injury ( figure 3.1 ; next page ) . Topical administration of naloxone ( 100uM , one drop ) , reinstated peak pain behavior 16 weeks after initial corneal surface injury ( figure 3.2 ; next page ) . We hypothesize that our patient population with monocular trauma and dry eye symptoms mirrors our murine model . The monocular trauma represents the initial corneal surface injury , and the dry eye symptoms represent the breakthrough pain . It is important to note that in other models of latent sensitization , peak pain responses can be reinstated by stressors other than opioid antagonism . Specifically , novel environment stressors and forced swims reproduce peak pain behavior experienced in the hyperalgesic phase . In a similar way , our patient population endorses exacerbation of dry eye symptoms in the setting of stress , sleep , and environmental changes . Our study aims to differentiate dry eye disease from ocular neuropathic pain by testing the latent sensitization model in the human eye . Given that there is good data to suggest chronic pain states , including our ocular model , can be masked by upregulation of the mu-opioid receptor signaling pathway , we hypothesize that our naloxone hydrochloride drop will induce a hyperalgesic response to hypertonic saline in a population with dry eye diagnosis and monocular trauma . We believe a topical naloxone ophthalmic drop is a potentially easy , cheap , and safe diagnostic tool for ocular neuropathic pain .",2020-06-24,"November 4, 2022","Inclusion Criteria : monocular trauma dry eye disease diagnosis Exclusion Criteria : any pathology that might contribute to ocular pain , including corneal surface ulcers , uveitis , or other chronic inflammatory processes any current corneal surface pathology history of bilateral ocular trauma currently taking any of the following medications : TCAs , opioids , gabapentin , SNRIs pregnant nor breastfeeding .",1,0,18 Years,65 Years

We hypothesized that early use of corticosteroids , low dose , in mild disease , can decrease progression to respiratory failure and death .","We are in the middle of a coronavirus pandemic , facing a large number of infections in serious cases and an increasing number of deaths in Chile .

Most patients have mild disease , but older people and those with comorbidities can develop severe disease that requires hospitalization , some form of ventilatory support , and eventually intensive care unit admission . The pathophysiology occurs in two different overlapping phases , the initial pathogen with viral replication , followed by the host 's inflammatory response with varying degrees of severity associated with different clinical characteristics . The pathological progression in some cases of severe COVID-19 would be explained by an excess of proinflammatory cytokines , which leads to diffuse alveolar damage , with the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) and inflammatory compromise of multiple systems until death . In the absence of any proven antiviral therapy , current clinical treatment is primarily supportive care , supplemental oxygen , and mechanical ventilatory support .

University of Pittsburgh,NCT04790786,"UPMC OPTIMISE-C19 Trial, a COVID-19 Study",Erin McCreary,4,0,Covid19,Biological,Lilly Bamlanivimab,Other,,"Multiple monoclonal antibodies ( mABs ) have been shown to reduce viral burden and improve clinical outcomes , have been granted FDA Emergency Use Authorization ( EUA ) for use in select populations , and are routinely used in the UPMC Health System , which has made expanded access a priority . However , the comparative effectiveness of these mABS is unknown . The National Academies of Sciences , Engineering , and Medicine has called for expanded access and clinical use of mABs , noting it is `` critical to collect data and evaluate whether they are working as predicted '' . This pragmatic evaluation will determine the relative effects of the EUA-governed mABs versus each other . When U.S. government mAB policies change ( e.g. , FDA grants or revokes EUAs ) , UPMC Health System policies and the evaluated mABs will accordingly change .","While COVID-19 vaccination will reduce COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality , the learned immune response may vary between individuals . This means interventions such as monoclonal antibodies ( mAB ) will still be needed to prevent progression of COVID-19 illness . Monoclonal antibodies seek to mimic or enhance the natural immune system response against a pathogen and are often used in the care of patients with cancer or infection . For viral infections , mABs are created by exposing a white blood cell to a particular viral protein , which is then cloned to mass produce antibodies to target that virus . For SARS-CoV-2 , the virus that causes COVID-19 , IgG1 mABs target the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and block viral attachment and entry into cells . The SARS-CoV-2 mABs bamlanivimab and etesevimab , and the REGN-COV2 combination ( casirivimab + imdevimab ) reduce nasopharyngeal viral burden plus clinical outcomes including future emergency department visits and hospitalizations . Each received FDA Emergency Use Authorization ( EUA ) for use in selected populations . As of February 2021 , there are over 60,000 new cases of COVID-19 diagnosed daily in the US , with over 7000 daily COVID-19 related hospital admissions . Although case volumes are currently declining , COVID-19 remains a significant public health threat . Despite the EUAs , the clinical use of mABs is low due in part to lack of patient access , complexities in drug allocation , and lack of knowledge among providers are contributing factors . Further , the comparative effectiveness of different mABs is unknown and not yet directly studied . The National Academies of Sciences , Engineering , and Medicine recently called for expanded access and clinical use of mABs , noting it is `` critical to collect data and evaluate whether they are working as predicted '' . This evaluation seeks to determine their relative effects versus each other , starting with those governed by EUAs . OPTIMISE-C19 is a quality improvement ( QI ) study , governed by approvals from both the UPMC QI committee and the University of Pittsburgh IRB . Currently , mAB therapy is approved for use under EUA issued by the FDA . There are no data on the relative benefits of one mAB versus any other . mABs are ordered by UPMC physicians as a generic referral order and the order is filled by UPMC pharmacy via therapeutic interchange . The selection of mABs available within pharmacy is overseen by the UPMC pharmacy and therapeutics committee . OPTIMISE-C19 provides the therapeutic interchange via random allocation . The UPMC Quality Improvement Committee approved the OPTIMISE-C19 study , including the random therapeutic interchange . The University of Pittsburgh IRB considered the randomized therapeutic interchange to be quality improvement and approved the additional data collection and analyses . Patients provide verbal consent to receive mAB therapy . UPMC requires physicians to provide and review with patients the EUA Fact Sheet for each mAB , and explain that the patient could receive any of the EUA-governed mABs . As per EUA requirements , physicians discuss the risks and benefits of mABs with patients , and patients consent to receive a mAB as part of routine care , should they desire mAB treatment . Patients are told which mAB they are receiving , and physicians and patients can agree to the assigned mAB or request a specific mAB . It is the treating physicians ' and patients ' choice to accept the assigned mAB or not . The QI committee considered these steps to represent adequate consent to participate . The IRB considered that the provision of mAB therapy therefore fell under quality improvement and only the additional data collection and analyses represented research . The IRB waived any additional consent requirements .",2021-02-26,"May 21, 2023",Inclusion Criteria : COVID-19 positive patients Eligible for mAB under FDA EUA Exclusion Criteria : Death is deemed to be imminent or inevitable Previous participation in this REMAP within the last 90 days,4571,0,12 Years,120 Years

Without treatment , it can lead to severe visual impairment . Recurrence is the commonest complication and novel treatment approaches are crucial to prevent vision loss . The biological processes underlying the formation of pterygium are complex , but central to its pathogenesis is the angiogenic cytokine vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) . VEGF is upregulated under conditions of increased oxidative stress , which plays an integral role in pterygium development ( Cardenas-Cantu et al. , 2016 , Karaman , 2018 , Norrby , 1998 , Rossino et al. , 2020 , Shibunya , 2011 ) .Various biomarkers on pterygium have been identified and are useful to determine the effectiveness of new modality treatment for pterygium . These markers can be identified via histopathological stain such as Masson Trichrome to observe changes of collagen fibres . Other identifiable markers include the use of special immunohistochemical stain such as anti CD34 antibody for microvascular density and anti-8-OHdG antibody for oxidative changes in the pterygium tissue . By analyzing the changes with or without Ranibizumab injection in addition to observation of clinical recurrence rate of pterygium , we are able to conclude the effectiveness of anti-VEGF on pterygium recurrence . The aim of the study was to evaluate the association between collagen fibres changes , microvascular density changes and inflammation resultant from oxidative stress with the clinical recurrence of pterygium following intralesional Ranibizumab injection in comparison to control group .","This is a prospective interventional study conducted from May 2018 to April 2020 . Patients with primary pterygium who attended eye clinic Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia ( HUSM ) Kubang Kerian , Kelantan and fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria were recruited as participants of this study . Convenient sampling method was applied for participants ' recruitment where all patients will be given thorough explanation in regards to the study and subsequently divided into interventional and control group . Intervention group participants were given intralesional Ranibizumab ( 0.5mg/ 0.05mL ) 2 weeks prior to pterygium excision surgery . Both groups of participants undergo pterygium excision with autologous conjunctival graft surgery thereafter . Excised pterygium tissues were sent to the laboratory for slide preparation and staining with specific reagents including Masson Trichrome for collagen fibers , anti CD34 antibody for microvascular density and anti-8 OHdG antibody for oxidative stress changes .

The study is designed to test the requirements of predicted N. gonorrhoeae virulence determinants for gonococcal infection in the male urethra through infection with engineered mutants of N. gonorrhoeae . We hypothesize that key virulence determinants involved in N. gonorrhoeae adherence and resistance to innate immunity are essential for infection in the male urethra . We predict that mutations abolishing expression of these virulence determinants will eliminate or significantly reduce gonococcal infectivity or the ability to induce inflammation in an infected individual , thus identifying potential vaccine candidates . For each mutant to be investigated under this protocol , initial trials will be conducted in which subjects receive a bacterial inoculum containing a mixture of equivalent numbers of two isogenic strains , differing in expression of one or more genes . A competitive advantage for one strain during urethral infection will be manifest by recovery of that strain in a statistically significantly higher proportion of isolates recovered from infected subjects than in the inoculum . Following infections with mixed inocula , infectivity of the mutant in single-strain infections will be compared to that of the wild-type in single-strain infections . In addition , the proportion of infected subjects that develop signs or symptoms of urethritis with mutant and wild- type inocula will be compared . The Mixed FA7527/FA1090 group ( n = up to 25 ) will receive a bacterial inoculum containing a mixture of equivalent numbers of the isogenic mutant and WT strains . In single-strain infections , the Mutant FA7527 group ( n = up to 8 ) will receive a bacterial inoculum containing only the isogenic mutant N. gonorrhoeae strain , and the Wild-type FA1090 group ( n = up to 8 ) will receive a bacterial inoculum containing only the wild-type ( WT ) N. gonorrhoeae strain . All subjects will be examined daily for symptoms of infection and receive antibiotic treatment at the end of the inpatient portion of the trial . Study duration will be 1 year , and the duration for all participants will be about 3 weeks . The primary objective of the study is to compare the ability of different engineered mutants of Neisseria gonorrhoeae to cause a clinical infection ( signs or symptoms of urethritis such as discomfort during urination , urethral discharge , etc . ) in the male urethra . The study secondary objectives are to : ( 1 ) characterize host immune responses to infection by measuring cytokines and other mediators in specimens including serum , peripheral blood lymphocytes and urine obtained from subjects before , during and after experimental gonococcal infection , and ( 2 ) characterize bacterial gene expression during experimental infection .",2021-04-29,"November 2, 2021","Inclusion Criteria : Healthy man between the ages of 18 and 35 years .

Kinderkrankenhaus auf der Bult,NCT04234867,Study to Explore the Effect of Dapagliflozin and Stress in Adolescent and Adult Subjects With Type 1 Diabetes (T1D),Kinderkrankenhaus auf der Bult,1,0,Type 1 Diabetes,Drug,Dapagliflozin,Treatment,Triple,"Type 1 Diabetes is characterized by an absolute lack of insulin caused by autoimmune ß-cell destruction . Looking for different therapeutic approaches , beyond the administration of Insulin SGLT-Inhibitors ( SGLT=sodium-glucose cotransporter ) like Dapagliflozin look like a promising option to avoid hyperglycaemic excursions which are a reason for glycaemic variability by renal excretion of excessive glucose without administration of extra insulin . But also euglycemic DKA has been reported during SGLT2 add-on therapy to insulin in T1D and mechanistic studies have been called for . The role of Dapagliflozin-induced hyperglucagonemia and stress/infection precipitating euglycemic DKA in this situation is unclear . Thus the purpose of this pilot study is to collect clinical data on the development of DKA after insulin-withdrawal with Dapagliflozin compared to placebo and the added effect of a single dose of 4mg/kg i.v . ACTH as mediator of stress . The first objective is to investigate the time to DKA ( defined as Bicarbonate < 19 mmol/l ) after insulin withdrawal during treatment with a stable 5 day single daily dose of 10mg Dapagliflozin in patients with type 1 Diabetes . In addition it should be evaluate the additional effect of stress , modelled by a single injection of ACTH on DKA development during Dapagliflozin Treatment . We also want to know if Dapagliflozin influences glucagon levels during insulin withdrawal and how this is associated with the time course of DKA development .","The purpose of the Dapastress trial is , to evaluate if some metabolic parameters can be identified as an early marker or contributor in development of ketonic metabolic imbalance . As the hormonal `` background '' is completely different in pubertal adolescents compared to adults ( especially contra-insulin hormones as growth hormone , glucagon ) . Approximately 20 subjects 18-45 years will be screened in order to randomize 16 patients , where stress and Dapagliflozin ( or corresponding placebo ) will be administered independently . The trial will consist of 14 visits : a screening visit ( Visit 1 ) , 4 overnight visits complexes ( Visit 2 to Visit 13 ) , including phone visits and a follow-up visit ( Visit 14 ) . Furthermore , an information visit will take place prior to the screening visit in order to obtain patient 's informed consent . Screening will take place 2-21 days prior to Visit 2 . The follow-up visit will take place 5-21 days after the end of Visit 13 . The overnight visits will be separated by a wash-out period ( 5-30 days between the end of each visit complex and start of next complex ) during which the subjects will resume their normal insulin treatment . Each phone visit will take place 3-5 days after the end of overnight Visits . The planned total duration of the trial is 58-100 days per subject ( rescheduled visits excluded ) . Each subject will be randomised to a unique treatment sequence ( 1:1:1:1 ) . Seq 1 : A D B C Seq 2 : B A C D Seq 3 : C B D A Seq 4 : D C A B ( e.g . A Dapa-Stress , B Dapa-Placebo Stress , C Placebo- Stress , D Placebo-Placebo Stress ) After randomization patients will receive Dapagliflozin/placebo for 5 single daily Dosis . During the overnight visits the metabolic control will be achieved by a variable i.v . Infusion of human Insulin by an Infusion pump . The procedure will be used in order to aim and maintain blood glucose levels between 70 and 180 mg/dl . The fluid Infusion and Insulin dosing scheme will depend on Body weight and blood glucose levels . At approximately 03:00 hours in the morning the blood glucose should be within target range . Then insulin infusion will be suspended . In the morning the last dose of actual study medication ( Dapagliflozin/ Placebo ) and the single dose of stress ( ACTH or placebo ) will be administered . During now started stress phase blood samples for determination of metabolic Panels , blood gas analysis , Glucose and ketone will be taken hourly and vital signs tested . 12 hours after administration of stress ( ACTH or placebo ) the patients will resume their CSII and will be discharged when being well on investigator 's judgement .",2020-01-16,"June 2, 2023","Inclusion Criteria : Provision of informed consent from participant and all legal representatives prior to any study specific procedures Age : Female and/or male aged > 18 years Subject must have type 1 diabetes ( as diagnosed clinically ) ≥ 12 months HbA1c 0.5 nmol/l Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) > 2X Upper limit of normal ( ULN ) Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) > 2X ULN Serum total bilirubin > 2X ULN ( except known Gilbert 's disease ) Creatine kinase ( CK ) > 3X ULN Estimated GFR ( eGFR ) by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease ( MDRD ) formula ≤ 60 ml/min/1.73m2 .

In spite of the high number of studies in this area , there is limited high-quality and comparative research that presents definitive findings suggesting the effectiveness of any single intervention for RD prevention . So , the current phase III clinical trial study was conducted to measure the preventive effects of the aforementioned boron-based gel on different outcomes . Design : The parallel design , randomized , double blinded and placebo controlled phase III clinical trial was conducted . One-hundred-eighty-one and seventy-six patients aged 18-75 years were assigned to intervention and placebo groups respectively . Patients in intervention and placebo groups received daily a gel containing 3 % sodium pentaborate pentahydrate and gel free of any chemical treatment respectively 15 minutes before the RT session . Dermatitis , erythema , dry desquamation , moist desquamation and necrosis were compared between two groups in terms of percent and number needed to treat . Settings and conduct : The female breast cancer patients who admitted to the Shahid Madani Hospital were initially assessed during 2018-2019 and those aged 18-75 years old with no previous history of radiotherapy were invited to the study . Pregnant women , patients with unknown dermatitis and those without any willing to participate in this study were excluded . As there was no similar study to compare our outcome studied , we included 30 patients in the pilot study . Afterwards , the sample size of 16 were calculated for each group based on the erythema to ensure the power of 0.8 and type I error of 0.05 . However , we increased the sample size of the study to 181 and 76 subjects in intervention and placebo groups respectively to meet the sample size guidelines for Food and Drug Administration Phase III Clinical Trial Studies , address at least 20 % attrition rate during the study , and to enhance the randomization efficiency in balancing the patterns of confounding variables between intervention and placebo groups . As there was no usual treatment for the radiation dermatitis in breast cancer patients , increasing the sample size was not ethically questionable . Participants/Inclusion and exclusion criteria : Inclusion : Patients who are admitted to the study are enrolled in the study and have head and neck cancer in the breast , and are between the ages of 18 and 75 years old and have not received radiotherapy before . Exclusion : Pregnant women , patients with unknown dermatitis and those without any willing to participate in this study were excluded . Intervention groups : The aim of the study was fully described to the eligible subjects and informed consent was gathered . Afterwards , the patients were assigned into the intervention and placebo groups . In the intervention and placebo groups , subjects received daily a gel containing 3 % sodium pentaborate pentahydrate and gel free of any chemical treatment respectively 15 minutes before the radiotherapy session . As the gels were used on the target areas of the patients by the researchers , there was no compliance problem in this study . Afterwards , the study 's outcomes were examined at 25th day of treatment for the patients in two groups . Main outcome variables : Dermatitis and its grades including erythema , dry desquamation , moist desquamation and necrosis were considered as main outcomes in this study based on the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group ( RTOG ) criteria .",2020-01-20,"January 26, 2020","Inclusion Criteria : Patients who are admitted to the study are enrolled in the study and have head and neck cancer in the breast , and are between the ages of 18 and 75 years old and have not received radiotherapy before .

Such treatment eliminates important endogenous and exogenous inducers of the systemic inflammatory response ( PAMPs and DAMPs ) , proinflammatory mediators ( cytokines and ROS ) , and other biologically active substances ( nitric oxide , prostaglandins , and bradykinin ) that are involved in the pathogenesis of organ failure . Several case reports also suggest that PE is an effective rescue therapy in critically ill patients with influenza A ( H1N1 ) . However , the efficacy of PE has not been evaluated in critically ill patients with COVID-19 disease .",2020-05-02,"March 24, 2022",Inclusion Criteria : Male or female subject ≥18 years and 0.5 micrograms/ kg/minute ) Decompensated Cirrhosis Chronic kidney disease requiring hemodialysis Active neoplastic disease Severe chronic heart failure ( NYHA class III or IV ) Severe pulmonary disease ( GOLD III or IV ) HIV infection ( AIDS criteria ),36,0,18 Years,80 Years
Baylor College of Medicine,NCT04371536,Oral Iron Versus Oral Iron Plus a Web-based Behavioral Intervention in Young Children (IRONCHILD),Baylor College of Medicine,3,1,Iron Deficiency Anemia,Drug,Ferrous Sulfate,Treatment,,"Iron deficiency anemia ( IDA ) affects nearly half a million young children in the United States . Most children take liquid iron medicine by mouth for at least 3 months . However , some children take longer to get better with this medicine . This study is trying to compare different ways of giving iron medicine to young children . For young children in the US , the main cause of IDA is nutritional , or not having enough iron in the foods they eat . This often happens when kids drink too much cow milk and/or not eating enough foods that have a lot of iron . Iron deficiency is most common in children ages 1 to 4 years of age , during a time that is important for brain development . More severe and long-lasting IDA is associated with worse brain development outcomes . That is why researchers want to understand the fastest way for kids with IDA to get better . Standard treatment is oral iron medicine for 3 to 6 months . Many children do not take their iron medicine the full amount of time needed because of side effects like abdominal discomfort , nausea , constipation , and bad taste . Different factors can contribute to patients not completing their IDA therapy . Many families do not understand how important it is to treat IDA or do not have the motivation to continue the medication . This study will offer different methods for treating IDA , including a different method to taking the oral iron therapy . This new method gives oral iron by increasing a family 's understanding and motivation . Another research study that interviewed families of young children with IDA found ways that helped the patients to continue their therapy . Using that information , a website called IRONCHILD was created to help motivate parents to get their children to continue the oral iron medicine . Research studies that compare these different IDA treatment methods in young children are needed and could have benefits to short-term clinical and long-term brain development . However , we do not know whether families of young children with IDA will be willing to participate in this type of study that has different treatment methods ( oral iron therapy and oral iron therapy with a web-based adherence intervention ) . The goal of this clinical research study is to learn which of the two methods of care will be the best way for children with iron deficiency anemia to receive therapy .","First , the doctor will confirm that patients are eligible for the study . Patients will complete the following procedures : Medical history including prior hospitalizations , lab results , medications , diet , social and family history Comprehensive Physical Examination which includes measurement of vital signs , examination of the head , eyes , ears , nose , mouth , heart , lungs , abdomen , and skin . Blood samples : Patients will not have any extra blood draws for this study , as the investigators will draw the blood during routine blood draws . Investigators will ask to take a little extra blood ( less than half a teaspoon ) for research tests . All other blood draws that patients have while on study will be for routine care and not for research purposes . Patients will be on the study for 12 weeks . Patients will receive dietary counseling on the amount of cow milk they may have and information sheets on iron-rich foods . There are 2 different treatments in this study and patients can not choose which treatment they receive . Instead , they will be randomly assigned to one of the two treatments . That means there is a 50-50 chance that patients will receive liquid iron medicine by itself or that patients will receive liquid iron medicine with access to the website . Depending on which method of care patients are assigned to , they will complete the following procedures below . Oral Iron Therapy : Patients will receive liquid iron medicine by mouth once per day for 12 weeks . Patients will first receive this medicine during their first visit . During the Week 4 visit , patients will compete the following procedures : Blood Samples : Patients will not have any extra blood draws ( pokes ) for this study as blood for research will be collected during routine blood draws .

Our Lady of the Lake Hospital,NCT04377204,The Utility of Long-acting Local Anesthetic Agents in Reducing Post-operative Opioid Requirements Following Rhinoplasty,Our Lady of the Lake Hospital,0,1,"Pain, Postoperative",Drug,marcaine bupivacaine,Prevention,Single,"On average , more than 130 Americans die every day from opioid overdose . Surgeons provide 37 % of all opioid prescriptions in the United states , second only behind pain management physicians . A recent report found that patients who receive a 5-day supply of opioid medication have a 10 % chance of using opioids 12 months later . Additionally , studies have shown that many opioid abusers are not the intended recipient , with over half diverting them from friends and family . Rhinoplasty is one of the most common procedures performed by facial plastic surgeons , with over 215,000 performed in the United States in 2017 . Patients undergoing nasal surgery have been shown to be at significant risk for persistent and prolonged opioid use after filling an opioid prescription in the perioperative period . Thus , the management of postoperative pain without contributing to the opioid epidemic is a imperative . The first three days following nasal surgery are generally associated with considerable pain , with the highest levels occuring within the initial 24 hours . Published studies have demonstrated the benefit of non-opioid medications following rhinoplasty , such as pregabalin and celecoxib . There has also been growing recognition of the benefits of `` pre-emptive analgesia , '' such as the use of local anesthesia , which not only helps control pain , but in turn decreases the anxiety caused by pain and can prevent patient turning to narcotics to break the cycle . These studies have predominantly focused on the immediate postoperative period , e.g . the first 24 hours . Currently , many surgeons use lidocaine with 1 % epinephrine as local anesthesia for rhinoplasty due to its widespread availability , rapid time to onset , and safety profile . Several studies have shown the benefit of Marcaine bupivacaine over lidocaine for pain control and opioid consumption during the first 24 hours after surgery . This is not surprising , as the half-life of lidocaine is approximately 90 minutes in a healthy individual , compared to 160 minutes for Marcaine bupivacaine . However , there are no studies to date that have evaluated the effect that long-acting local anesthesia has on post-operative opioid consumption past the first 24 hours after surgery . Our study aims to compare total postoperative opioid use for patients who received lidocaine as local anesthesia at the time of surgery versus a mixture of lidocaine and Marcaine bupivacaine .","The local anesthesia regimen administered prior to surgery is a standard practice for rhinoplasty procedures . However , there is variation in the kind of anesthetic utilized during this time . In our practice , we have used different combinations along with epinephrine which include lidocaine or lidocaine with Marcaine bupivacaine dilutions . Although both are effective at pre-operative local numbing , investigators have seen less reported pain outcomes as perceived by the patient feedback . Therefore , investigators aim to identify specifically the usage of post-operative pain medication with those who had an epinephrine/lidocaine local anesthetic vs. those who had the epi/lidocaine/bupivacaine combination . Patients will be informed about the study and consented for participation . They will be randomized pre-operatively by permuted block assignment to the control treatment ( 1 % lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine ) or the study treatment ( 1 % lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine mixed 1:1 with 0.5 % Marcaine bupivacaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine ) using a predetermined weight-calculated maximum dosage that would be safe for injection of either anesthesia . As per standard procedure , the patients will be premedicated with a standardized dose of versed if determined necessary by anesthesia . Anesthesia will be induced utilizing weight based dosing of propofol and rocuronium . Intraoperative anesthesia will be maintained utilizing total intravenous anesthesia ( propofol , fentanyl/remifentanyl doses ) . All patients will be given antibiotics ( weight based dosing , Ancef or Clindamycin ) and 8mg of dexamethasone prior to skin incision . Once anesthesia has been induced , the nose will be injected with local anesthesia as follows : transcutaneous to the bilateral dorsal nasal and the angular neurovascular bundles , transcutaneously along the columella and nasal dorsum , transnasally along the nasal dorsum and ala , the bilateral nasal septum , and the inferior turbinates with a total dose of 10ml 's . Topical decongestion and anesthesia will then be obtained with 3 x 0.5cm cottonoids soaked with 4 % cocaine placed bilaterally . A standard external rhinoplasty approach will the be performed , and grafting done as necessary . At then end of the procedure , Doyle nasal septal splints will be placed ( Reuter-Bivalves if alar grafting performed ) . In the immediate post-operative period , pain will be controlled with short acting analgesics ( standardized regimen for all patients to be decided with anesthesia team ) while in the acute care setting and recorded again as per standard of care . Once discharged from acute care , the patient will be given instructions to control their pain with acetaminophen ( 1000mg every 8 hours ) scheduled during the first 72 hours , then as needed thereafter . They will also be given a prescription for oxycodone ( 15 tablets ) with instruction to take 5mg every 6 hours as needed for breakthrough pain . They will be provided a pain diary for the first 24 hours to record their pain using the Faces scale ( ranging 1-10 with 1 being no pain up to 10 being the worst pain ever experienced ) at the 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 12 , and 24 hours marks after discharge from surgery . Additionally , they will be asked to keep track of how many pain medications ( oxycodone ) they took over the first week after surgery . Their pain scores and amount of medication utilized will be recorded upon their follow up visit to the clinic .",2020-05-04,"March 22, 2023",Inclusion Criteria : ages 18 and over undergoing external rhinoplasty Exclusion Criteria : Pre-existing chronic pain within 30 days prior to surgery Opioid use within 30 days before their surgery Patients undergoing a concurrent procedure ( i.e . facial rejuvenation ),5,0,18 Years,100 Years

The hypothesis of this study is that the addition of agents that inhibit viral entry or replication of SARS-CoV-2 virus replication in will be devoid of additional moderate to severe toxicities , will prevent clinical deterioration , and will improve viral clearance in high risk individuals .","Coronavirus Disease 2019 ( COVID-19 ) is a highly contagious disease , caused by a novel enveloped RNA beta-coronavirus , also known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 ( SARS-CoV-2 ) . The first case of this unprecedented outbreak `` pneumonia of unknown etiology '' was reported in Wuhan City , Hubei Province , China on December 8th , 2019 and reported to the World Health Organization ( WHO ) on December 31st , 2019. WHO declared a COVID-19 global emergency on January 30 , 2020 , and then categorized the outbreak as a pandemic on March 11 , 2020 . As of April 22 , 2020 , more than 2,628,894 confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide and 182,740 people globally have died from COVID-19 since it emerged in China , according to the data from Johns Hopkins University . While the majority of patients with COVID-19 develop mild or uncomplicated illness , approximately 20-30 % of hospitalized patients have required intensive care support and 5 % of those have multi-organ failure or shock . The case fatality rate ranges from 1 to 4 % and it is higher among those with pre-existing comorbid conditions such as cardiovascular disease , diabetes mellitus , obesity , chronic respiratory disease , hypertension and cancer . The vast majority of patients present with fever ( 83-99 % ) , cough ( 59-82 % ) , fatigue ( 44-70 % ) , anorexia ( 40-84 % ) , shortness of breath ( 31-40 % ) , sputum production ( 28-33 % ) , myalgias ( 11-35 % ) . Less than 10 % of patients will present with headache , confusion , rhinorrhea , sore throat , hemoptysis , vomiting , or diarrhea . Anosmia or ageusia proceeding the onset of respiratory symptoms has been anecdotally reported . To date , treatments for COVID-19 in high risks individuals remain experimental and therapeutic strategies to deal with the infection are at best supportive , with prevention aimed at reducing transmission in the community as the best weapon . No proven therapies have been demonstrated to prevent the progression of COVID-19 to severe illness and this is a critical unmet need for high-risk individuals and warrants study . Recently , the Infectious Disease Society of America has made recommendations for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 , focusing on inpatient care , and recommending randomized trials where possible as the best step to improve treatment outcomes and to increase our understanding of this coronavirus pandemic . Discoveries in this area may inform clinicians on effective treatment for low-risk individuals who progress to severe illness , as well .",2020-05-01,"January 18, 2022","Inclusion Criteria Age ≥18 years Laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection within the past 7 days or the presence of symptoms or physical examination signs providing high probability of COVID-19 disease Patients must have adequate organ and marrow function measured within the last 6 months Subjects must have at least one of the following high-risk features for clinical deterioration : Hypertension Diabetes Mellitus Moderate to severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease , Emphysema , Cystic Fibrosis , or Asthma Cancer patients who have received any immunosuppressive drugs within a year from enrollment Sickle Cell disease or thalessemia Age > or = 50 BMI > or = 30 Living in a nursing home or long-term facility Underlying serious heart condition as determined by the treating physician Immunocompromised subject as defined by the treating physician or COVID-19 Telehealth Treatment Team Exclusion Criteria Severe or life threating COVID Weight less than 45 kg .

Universidad de Colima,NCT05562401,Effect of Coconut Water on Hydration Status in Pediatric Population,Universidad de Colima,4,1,Sports Nutrition,Device,Coconut Water,Prevention,Double,"Introduction : The dehydration is a very common problem that is often not identified . The pediatric population is more susceptible to dehydration due to its physiological characteristics . Proper hydration is crucial for health since any degree of dehydration causes a reduction in physical and mental work capacity , hence the importance of preventing it by considering the type of drink . There are multiple beverage options , including industrial oral electrolytes ( OE ) , on the other hand , coconut water ( CW ) has been studied as a natural alternative beverage with characteristics that can help maintain a state of euhydration . Objective : To determine if AC has a greater effect on hydration status than OE in adolescents who perform physical exercise . Material and methods : RCT , double blind . 34 subjects aged 13.02 ± 1.08 years were selected , assigned to treatment with either OE ( Electrolit® ) or CW . They received a weekly physical exercise session ( 4 weeks ) . Hydration was personalized ( ml x kilograms of weight ) and hydration was evaluated by Urine Specific Gravity ( USG ) , Total Body Water ( TBW ) by bioimpedance and changes in body mass . Results : There were no significant differences in hydration in the first 3 exercise sessions ( p > 0.05 ) , however , in the last session there was a significant difference between treatments ( p=0.003 ) . Conclusion : AC and OE have the same effect on hydration levels in adolescents who perform physical exercise .","For current epidemiological reasons of Covid-19 , an increase of 30 % of losses has been considered already established in the sample size , giving a total of 22 participants per group ( 44 in total ) . For the same reason , two groups of 22 participants ( 11 experimental and 11 controls ) will be divided in order to reduce the population and the risk of contagion , following the health protocols established by the institution mentioned in Annex 2 . The type of randomization to be used in the study will be based on the assigned treatment ( A / B ) by the balanced block method . This method consists of assembling a series of blocks , made up of a certain number of cells , in which the different types of treatment are included . The number of blocks will be determined by the number of participants to be included and the number of cells that it has been decided to include in each block , so in the present study 12 blocks with four treatment cells will be placed , giving a total of 44 treatments to the same as the number of study subjects . Each block will contain in each cell one of the treatment alternatives and within each block there must be a balanced number of possible treatments . Treatments A and B will be written in blocks ( 22 with treatment A and 22 with treatment B ) . The randomization will be carried out by a person external to the study and the same person will be the one who will randomly assign the treatments in the blocks and the numbering of each block . They will be summoned to 12:00 noon on Monday or Tuesday only according to the group assigned to start with the collection of personal data ( Annex 3 ) and a mental test called Psychological Characteristics related to Sports Performance ( CPRD ) ( Annex 4 ) which will be applied by an expert in the area of psychology , in addition , if training is required for the application of the test , the main researcher will be trained to be able to perform it properly . After taking personal data , hydrating drinks will be administered immediately before training ( 7 ml x kg of weight ) 4 hours before . At 2:00 p.m. , your corresponding hydrating drink ( 4 ml x kg of weight ) will be administered again . Each participant will have a 600 ml graduated glass that will be granted by the researcher to keep track of the drink administered at the different times of each session . Immediately afterwards , the anthropometry and urine sample will be taken . To record body mass , the protocol developed by the International Society for the Advancement of Kinanthropometry ( ISAK ) will be followed . The study subjects will be weighed in sports shorts and barefoot before starting physical exercise , having been told that , in the case of urinating or defecating , they should do so before the initial weigh-in . Simultaneously with taking the body mass , the % ACT will be determined by electrical bioimpedance . To record body mass and % of ACT water , the Tanita BC-533 bioimpedance scale will be used with a reliability of 97 % , precision of 0.1kg and with a measuring range of 0-150kg . Once the anthropometry and urine sample have been taken , a 200 ml dose will be administered immediately before exercise ( 10-15 ) min . They will continue with the physical exercise protocol which will receive a physical exercise session per week ( Tuesdays ) , with a duration of 1 hour and 15 minutes each session . The exercise sessions will be carried out in the Domingo Savio sports fields and will be taught by the principal investigator who has worked as a sports coach in the soccer area for 3 years , in addition to being trained for this purpose in the same institution where he was will carry out the study . Days prior to the start of the practical execution of the protocol , parents and selected students will be summoned to a meeting in order to explain the dynamics that will take place . The physical exercise sessions will consist of 4 parts : The first part of the workout will consist of a 10 minute warm-up and stretching to increase your basal HR and prepare the body for the next high intensity stages and prevent injuries in teens . The warm-up will have a break of 5 minutes and hydration of 2 ml x kg of weight . This second part will take place in 12 min of continuous jogging around the field at an average pace , aiming to do one lap every 1 minute 36 seconds , giving a total of 7 and a half laps to the soccer field ( Cooper 's Test ) . 8 min rest for the total recovery of energy systems and hydration of 2 ml x kg of weight . In the second part of the training , the adolescents must run from one line to another , twenty meters apart , at the pace set by a tape . This race pace will increase every minute . Subjects start the test at a speed of 8 km / hr , the first minute increases to 9 km / hr and thereafter , each minute increases the pace ½ km / hr . The test ends when they can not keep up with the pace set ( Test de course Navette ) . Approximate time 10 min with 8 min rest and hydration of 2 ml x kg of weight . In this last part of the training session , it is a type of exercise based on tabatas , which consists of performing 8 different exercises for 20 seconds per 10 seconds of rest to the rhythm of the marked music , giving a time of 4 minutes per tabata . .2 tabatas will be made with an intermediate rest of 3 min between each tabata and hydration of 2 ml x kg of weight . At the end of this last stage of the training session , anthropometry and information collection will be taken where the percentage of weight change , body composition with bioimpedance will be determined before starting the final hydration , since if it is done at the In reverse , it is very likely that no one will come out in a state of dehydration . After the anthropometry , they will be administered the corresponding post-exercise hydration ( 1.5 ml x kg of weight ) and the urine sample will be collected . In the event that a subject has not urinated due to dehydration , their sterilized bottle will be taken home and the head of research will be notified immediately for its proper conservation or transport . The calculation of the percentage of lost weight will be calculated using the following formula : % Weight Loss or Dehydration = [ ( Initial Weight - Final Weight ) / Initial Weight ] x 100 . As a final point , the data obtained before the exercise will be compared with the data obtained after the exercise , where the euhydration cut-off points will be analyzed to categorize the subject as dehydrated or euhydrated . An effective drink ( CW or OE ) will be considered when any 2 or more indicators ( GEO , ACT or Body Mass ) are consistent with the euhydration thresholds .",2021-12-15,"September 27, 2022","Inclusion Criteria : Students that belong to `` Instituto Salesiano Fray Pedro de Gante '' .

Maimonides Medical Center,NCT04363437,COlchicine in Moderate-severe Hospitalized Patients Before ARDS to Treat COVID-19,Maimonides Medical Center,2,0,Coronavirus Infection,Drug,Colchicine,Treatment,,"The most prevalent complication of COVID-19 infection is respiratory failure from severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) , the leading cause of mortality . There is increasing indication that the decompensation in severe COVD-19 infection may be due to a cytokine storm syndrome . This hyperinflammatory syndrome results in a fulminant and fatal hypercytokinemia and multiorgan failure . Approximately 15 % of patients with COVID-19 infection are hospitalized and 20-30 % of these hospitalized patients require ICU care and/or mechanical ventilation . Overall mortality in hospitalized patients is approximately 20-25 % . There is significant interest in therapies that can be given upstream to reduce the rate of mechanical ventilation and thus mortality . We hypothesize that treatment with colchicine in COVID-19 moderate-severe patients may decrease the risk of progression into ARDS requiring increased oxygen requirements , mechanical ventilation , and mortality .","Prospective , completely randomized , open labeled , controlled study .

Johns Hopkins University,NCT04365257,Prazosin to Prevent COVID-19 (PREVENT-COVID Trial),Johns Hopkins University,2,0,COVID-19,Drug,Prazosin,Treatment,,The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of prazosin to prevent cytokine storm syndrome and severe complications in hospitalized patients with Coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID-19 ) .,"In Coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID-19 ) , severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS-CoV-2 ) elicits an exuberant local or systemic immune response ( 'hyperinflammation ' ) in the lung and other sites of viral replication , compromising organ function and leading to high morbidity and mortality . Emerging evidence suggests that a subset of patients with COVID-19 develops a cytokine storm syndrome that is associated with elevation of pro-inflammatory cytokines . Catecholamines enhance inflammatory injury by augmenting the production of IL-6 and other cytokines through a self-amplifying feed-forward loop in immune cells that requires alpha-1 adrenergic receptor ( ⍺1-AR ) signaling . The ⍺1-AR antagonist prazosin prevents cytokine storm and markedly increased survival following inflammatory stimuli in preclinical models . In a retrospective study of outcomes in acute respiratory distress syndrome or pneumonia , patients who were taking ⍺1-AR antagonists had significantly lower probability of needing invasive mechanical ventilation and dying in the hospital compared to non-users . Prazosin may blunt surges in catecholamines and self-amplifying cytokine production ( including interleukin 6 ) and , as an early preemptive therapy in patients prior to disease progression , may prevent cytokine storm syndrome and severe complications of COVID-19 .

The majority of patients ( 8 out of 10 ) are known to have mild disease , manifested by respiratory tract symptoms associated with fever , headache , and body pain . However , it is possible that the disease progresses to a severe stage , whith the need for mechanical ventilation support associated with high morbidity and mortality . The progression of the disease is mainly due to the appearance of uncontrolled inflammation that also favors the development of disseminated clots . So far , there is no effective treatment to combat coronavirus ; however , the use of anti-inflammatory drugs is potentially effective in preventing complications from the disease . In this regard , low dose colchicine is relatively safe and effective as an anti-inflammatory . It has been used for many years in the control of inflammation secondary to the accumulation of uric acid crystals .

Mortality rates as high as 80 % have been reported among those who require mechanical ventilation , despite best available intensive care . Patients with severe COVID-19 by FDA definition who have not developed respiratory failure be treated with nebulized ZYESAMI™ ( aviptadil acetate , a synthetic version of Vasoactive Intestinal Polypeptide ( VIP ) ) 100 μg 3x daily plus Standard of Care vs. placebo + Standard of Care using an FDA 501 ( k ) cleared mesh nebulizer . The primary outcome will be progression in severity of COVID-19 ( i.e . critical OR severe progressing to critical ) over 28 days . Secondary outcomes will include blood oxygenation as measured by pulse oximetry , dyspnea , exercise tolerance , and levels of TNFα IL-6 and other cytokines .","Detailed Description : Attack of the Alveolar Type II ( ATII ) cell via its ACE2 surface receptor by the SARS-CoV-2 virus leads to respiratory failure , morbidity , and frequently mortality in COVID-19 . There is no approved treatment that specifically targets the pulmonary injury . Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide ( VIP ) is known to target the VPAC1 receptor of the ATII cell and to protect that cell against all manner of injuries , including smoke inhalation , exposure to stomach acid , and exposure to infectious agents . VIP prevents apoptosis , blocks cytokines , lowers TNFα levels , reverses CD4/CD8 ratio , and reduces cough and dyspnea in nonclinical and clinical studies . Aviptadil acetate , a synthetic form of Vasoactive Intestinal Polypeptide ( VIP ) has been awarded FDA Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of ARDS and Pulmonary Hypertension and EMEA Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of ARDS and Sarcoid . ZYESAMI™ ( Aviptadil ) has been granted FDA Fast Track Designation for the treatment of ARDS/Acute Lung Injury in COVID-19 . The objective of this study is to identify patients severe COVID-19 who have not yet developed respiratory failure and to treat them with inhaled ZYESAMI™ in the hope of preventing progression to Critical COVID-19 with Respiratory Failure . Nonclinical studies demonstrate that VIP is 70 % concentrated in the lung , where it binds primarily to ATII cells . VIP prevents NMDA-induced caspase-3 activation in the lung , inhibits IL6 and TNFα production , protects against HCl-induced pulmonary edema , These and other effects have been observed in numerous animal model systems of lung injury in mice , rats , guinea pigs , sheep , swine , and dogs . In these models , Aviptadil restores barrier function at the endothelial/alveolar interface and thereby protects the lung and other organs from failure . Both intravenous and inhalation preclinical toxicology and safety pharmacology have been performed in four species , with a six-month trial of inhaled Aviptadil in primates . Aviptadil is approved for human use in the treatment of erectile dysfunction in Scandinavia and several European countries in co-formulation with phentolamine and has a demonstrated phase 2 safety in trials for Sarcoid , Pulmonary Fibrosis , and Bronchospasm . No adverse safety signals were seen in a phase I trial IV Aviptadil in ARDS . In that phase I trial , 8 patients with severe ARDS on mechanical ventilation were treated with ascending doses of VIP . Seven of the 8 patients were successfully extubated and were alive at the five-day timepoint . Six left the hospital and one died of an unrelated cardiac event . A 60-day phase 2b/3 trial of IV Aviptadil ( NCT 04311697 ) has recently completed enrollment and 28-day top-line safety data have been reported . No unanticipated serious adverse events were reported . The only adverse event that was statistically more frequent in Aviptadil-treated participants than among placebo-treated participants was mild to moderate diarrhea , which has not been reported as a frequent side-effect of inhaled Aviptadil ( 30 % vs 1.5 % ; p < .001 ) . Systemic hypotension was seen in both Aviptadil-treated and placebo-treated participants ( 25 % vs 18.5 % ; P=NS ) . Five GCP phase 2 trials of Aviptadil were conducted under European regulatory authority . Non GCP healthy volunteer studies have shown that i.v . infusion of Aviptadil is well tolerated with few adverse effects including alterations in blood pressure , heart rate , or ECG . In addition to published studies of human use , Aviptadil has been used on a compounded basis in certain ICUs for many years in the belief that it preserves life and restores function in pulmonary hypertension , ARDS , and Acute Lung Injury ( ALI ) . In this study , patients with severe COVID-19 by FDA definition who have not developed respiratory failure will be treated with nebulized ZYESAMI™ 100 μg in 1 cc normal saline 3x daily plus Standard of Care vs. placebo + Standard of Care using an FDA 501 ( k ) cleared mesh nebulizer .

UMC Utrecht,NCT04362332,"Chloroquine, Hydroxychloroquine or Only Supportive Care in Patients AdmItted With Moderate to Severe COVID-19",UMC Utrecht,4,0,COVID-19,Drug,Chloroquine Sulfate,Treatment,,"Rationale : Currently there are no approved treatments for COVID-19 . In the Dutch treatment protocol guideline ( SWAB ) designated treatment is supportive care with the option to add chloroquine base ( CQ ) or hydroxychloroquine ( HCQ ) . CQ and HCQ are implemented because of their in vitro activity , results from small animal studies , and anecdotal patient 's data . There are no published randomized studies with these medications in patients with disease caused by any coronavirus . Objective : To evaluate if treatment with only supportive care or addition of one of two anti-COVID_19 agents ( chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine ) results in less disease progression in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 who require hospital admission . Study design : Multicentre , cluster randomized cross-over , open label trial . Hospitals will be randomly allocated to one of 3 treatment arms in sequential periods of one week : chloroquine base versus hydroxychloroquine versus supportive care without any drug presumed active against SARS-COV-2 . Patients will be treated based on the date of inclusion . Study population : Adults aged of 18 years and older with moderate to severe , with a NEWS-2 score ≤ 5 , laboratory confirmed COVID-19 , who require hospital admission in a ward outside the Medium Care or Intensive Care . Intervention ( if applicable ) : Depending on the treatment arm , the study subject will receive only supportive care or an addition with one of the two agents active against SARS-CoV-2 ( chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine ) . Main study parameters/endpoints : Disease progression defined as a NEWS-2 score ≥ 7 within 14 days , or admission to Medium Care or Intensive Care Unit , or death .","Study rationale CQ and HCQ were both employed in the treatment of COVID-19 in China . Based on unpublished anecdotal positive results in China , CQ is now implemented in China and the Netherlands in severe COVID-19 . HCQ is an analog of CQ with more anti-viral effectivity ex vivo , better safety and tolerability profile . Rationale for the employment of CQ and HCQ in China comes from the fact that both reduce COVID-19 replication ex-vivo . On top of this , both drugs have clear immunomodulating effects ( which is used for various indications to treat rheumatologic diseases ) and have shown promising results in patients with dengue and HIV . Currently , in the Dutch guidelines , for moderate severely ill patients CQ base is the first line of therapy for patients admitted in hospital with moderate to severe COVID-19 . The time needed to `` load '' the body when using CQ and thus the possible late onset of action suggests that initiation of treatment should be timely . Moreover , the hypothesized mode of action suggests that both HCQ and CQ inhibit cellular replication of COVID-19 but do not have an intrinsic effect on the virus , thus could be best employed when the viral load is low ( i.e . early phase of the disease ) and thus safe time to improve the subsequent immune response . This underlines that both drugs should be implemented early rather than late in the course of SARS-COV-2 infection . The investigators propose a cluster randomized controlled study evaluating the value of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine compared to no antiviral therapy in admitted patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 . Study design : Population Adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 , with moderate to severe symptoms and admitted to the hospital and a NEWS-2 score ≤ 5 , will be available for the study . Intervention All three treatment arms contain standard supportive care during hospital admission with in two arms an addition with either chloroquine ( CQ ) or hydroxychloroquine ( HCQ ) Despite the inclusion of CQ and HCQ as possible additional treatment for COVID-19 in the Dutch treatment guideline , there 's no conclusion on the best treatment strategy in this population . Based on pharmacokinetic modelling , and the safety profile , HCQ seems to be more promising than CQ , but both drugs have to be studied in relation to COVID-19 . Furthermore , the availability of both drugs might differ from country to country ; in the Netherlands for instance , chloroquine is widely available . Therefore , a 1:1:1 trial including standard supportive care with in addition CQ or HCQ as suggested in the LCI/SWAB guideline , the optimal dosages in the different treatment arms are as follows : Supportive care + chloroquine base arm : loading dose 600mg , followed by 300mg 12 hours later , followed by 300mg bid for 4 days ; total treatment duration of 5 days Supportive care + hydroxychloroquine arm : loading dose 400mg bid , followed by 200mg bid for 4 days ; total treatment duration of 5 days . Supportive care only . Dosage of chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine will be adjusted , if the patients has a renal impairment with an estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGDR ) < 10 , to 50 % of the initial dosage . If patient will be discharged from hospital before the end of the treatment , treatment is continued outside of the hospital . The general practitioner will receive note of the treatment at discharge .

University of Kentucky,NCT04364802,COVID-19: Povidone-Iodine Intranasal Prophylaxis in Front-line Healthcare Personnel and Inpatients,Nikita Gupta,2,1,COVID-19,Drug,Povidone-Iodine Nasal Spray and Gargle,Prevention,,"Povidone-iodine ( PVP-I ) is a broad-spectrum antiseptic with activity against bacteria , fungi , and viruses . It has been previously used in both intranasal preparations against Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus ( MRSA ) as well as oral preparations in in-vitro studies of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus ( SARS-CoV ) , Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus ( MERS-CoV ) , influenza H1N1 , and rotavirus with good efficacy . This study will evaluate the efficacy of PVP-I as prophylaxis in Coronavirus Disease 2019 ( COVID19 ) -negative front-line health care workers , hospital patients , and community members .","The COVID-19 pandemic , caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus - 2 ( SARS-CoV-2 ) , has been implicated in over 12 million cases and counting in the United States alone and has killed at least 1300 health care workers and > 250,000 citizens . This , added to the national shortage of personal protective equipment ( PPE ) and the need to reuse PPE , lends to the significantly increased risk to healthcare providers . At the beginning of this trial , there were only 360,000 cases . The highest concentration of viral particles resides within the nasopharynx . The virus is thought to spread via respiratory droplets with the potential for transmission via inhalation of droplets , contact to the nose and mouth with infected materials , and airborne transmission . Given that frontline workers are involved in high-risk procedures including intubation , bronchoscopy , proning patients ( which can lead to droplet production ) and in some cases are reusing PPE , finding ways to reduce viral load or viral exposure are paramount . Povidone-iodine ( PVP-I ) is a broad-spectrum antiseptic with activity against bacteria , fungi , and viruses . It has been previously used in both intranasal preparations against MRSA as well as oral preparations in in-vitro studies of SARS-CoV-2 , MERS-CoV , H1N1 , and rotavirus with good efficacy . Due to the known breadth of its antiviral activity and similarities in molecular structure , it can be extrapolated that PVP-I should have robust activity against SARS-CoV-2 . Eggers et al found that at a concentration of 1 % there was a reduction of viral activity of 99.99 % in in-vitro assays . At 2 minutes , a concentration of 0.23 % was enough to reduce viral loads appreciably . New data has demonstrated efficacy in-vitro of PVP-I against SARS-CoV-2 at low concentrations . PVP-I is widely used as an antiseptic and is well-tolerated and has been shown to have little to no effect on mucociliary clearance , olfaction , or thyroid function if iodine holidays are taken , although care must be utilized in monitoring . In this study , front line healthcare workers will be asked to complete a pre-participation survey and screened for COVID positivity . They will then be given premade PVP-I gargles and nasal sprays , as well as a calendar card to mark compliance . PVP-I nasal spray and gargle ( 10 % diluted 1:30 ) will be used prior to the start of a shift , during `` lunch break '' , and at the end of shift . First , the nasal spray will be sprayed in the nose ( 2 sprays each naris ) . For adequate coverage , the participant should be able to taste the iodine or see it in the back of the throat . This should be left in place for 30 seconds . Then , the participant will gargle the solution for 30 seconds and not have anything to eat or drink by mouth for 30 minutes . Treatment will continue for 3 weeks , or until the healthcare worker presents with COVID symptoms . Participants will then be tested for COVID positivity and asked to fill out a second questionnaire assessing study tolerability . At completion of the study , they will be asked to turn in their calendar card to assess how many applications they were able to complete . Given the high rate of asymptomatic carriers , a second arm will also be planned for patients who have a 7+ day hospitalization or who are set to undergo a significant surgical procedure . These patients will be offered participation in the study as well and will be given the same questionnaire and undergo preoperative testing if they consent . For patients in the study group , PVIP gargle and nasal sprays will be applied preoperatively or shortly after admission and enrollment in the study for the non-operative group . The patients will then be retested in 2 weeks or as directed by the presentation of symptoms concerning for infection with SARS-CoV-2 . Community spread has been found to be the most likely implicated in infection and thus the trial is now being expanded to include community members . Thus , a THIRD arm has now been added to include community members . Prescreening questionnaires will be given . As long as the participant has had no prior history of a positive COVID-19 test , they will be considered eligible for participation . After a screening consultation , they will undergo a COVID-19 test ( should be completed within 72 hours of screening ) . If negative , they will be eligible . Participants who are pregnant , breastfeeding , have thyroid disease or cancer , or who have an allergy to iodine/shellfish/or contrast dye can still participate but will automatically be on the control arm . Participants may opt to be on either the PVP-I arm or the control arm . They will be asked to fill out a daily questionnaire regarding their exposures and whether they were wearing a mask or if other people were wearing a mask at that time .",2020-04-25,"November 16, 2022",Inclusion Criteria : healthcare worker OR patient with expected hospital stay of 7+ days OR patient admitted for major surgery OR community member COVID19 negative by nasal swab test asymptomatic for COVID19 able to consent Exclusion Criteria : positive for COVID19 by nasal swab symptomatic for COVID19 unable to consent,98,0,18 Years,99 Years

Ain Shams University,NCT04220281,Comparison Between Two Drugs (Propofol and Nitroglycerin as a Hypotensive Agents During Endoscopic Sinus Surgery,Ain Shams University,1,0,Hypotensive Anesthesia,Drug,Propofol,Other,Triple,"Background and Objectives : FESS is a common minimally invasive surgery that requires a clear field to be performed well . Hypotensive anesthesia is one of the most common maneuvers performed to help in keeping the field clear . An ideal drug for hypotensive anesthesia should be cheap and familial to the anesthesiologist . So being familial with propofol and by using its cardio-depressant action the idea of the research was developed and comparing it with nitroglycerin ( a hypotensive agent in our protocol ) . Methods : The patients agreed to participate in the research were classified into two groups for comparison . Propofol group ; received propofol infusion all over the procedure , and nitroglycerin group ; received nitroglycerin infusion all over the procedure . Duration of surgery , visibility of surgical field and amount of blood loss were recorded . Pulse/min and MAP were recorded at baseline and every 5 min . Results : The mean duration of surgery was longer in the NTG to propofol group . There was high statistical significance in the average blood loss in the propofol group compared to NTG group . The visibility of the operative field also was significant in the propofol group as compared to NTG group . The mean heart rate in the NTG group is higher than the mean heart rate in the propofol group . The MAP in both groups is within a close range . Conclusion : Propofol and NTG can produce a safe and effective controlled hypotension during FESS . Whereas , propofol has ; a better surgical field visibility , less surgical bleeding and less tachycardia during FESS .","INTRODUCTION FESS ( functional endoscopic sinus surgery ) is a popular minimally invasive surgical technique for management of patient with sinus pathological conditions . The aim of this sinus endoscopic surgery is to restore a normal mucociliary clearing function and drainage of sinuses . Although , it is a minimally invasive surgery but it can lead to a serious complications such as optic nerve injury , orbital cellulitis , meningitis , and rhino-oral fistulas . Bleeding is one of the obstacles that is associated with this technique that can decrease the surgical field visualization and increase the probability of complications . One of the most important maneuvers used to minimize this bleeding is hypotensive anesthesia . The ideal hypotensive agent for anesthetist must be a familiar drug , easy to use , rapid onset and offset and with minimal side effects . Nitroglycerin infusion is a frequently used drug to produce controlled hypotension , as it is cheap and easy to use drug rapid onset and offset time . But a common side effect is reflex tachycardia and venous congestion which may also obscures the surgical filed and decreases surgeon satisfaction . Total intravenous anesthesia ( TIVA ) using propofol and remifentanil is a common procedure used in western countries . In Egypt remifentanil is not freely available . So this study will be designed to use inhalational anesthesia and use propofol infusion as a hypotensive agent and to determine whether controlled hypotension , surgeon 's satisfaction and better operative filed can be achieved when compared to nitroglycerine infusion . AIM OF THE WORK The aim of the study is to identify the efficacy of propofol infusion as a hypotensive agent in comparison with nitroglycerin infusion during FESS . Study Design A total of 40 adult patients undergoing FESS procedure for sinusitis . Written informed consent will be obtained from all patients before randomization . Patients will be divided equally into two groups the first 20 patients will be assigned to propofol group ( Prop group ) and the other group to nitroglycerin group ( NTG group ) . Group assignment , preparation and administration of drugs will be performed by a junior anesthetist who is neither involved nor interested by any means in the study . The patients , the ENT surgeon , and the anesthetist collecting data all were blind to the groups . The anesthetist performing the general anesthesia was not blinded to the drug given but he was not one of the study participants .",2020-01-04,"February 12, 2020","Inclusion Criteria : Patients ASA I and II diagnosed for chronic sinusitis Age range between 18-60 years , undergoing elective FESS without septoplasty under general anesthesia .

King Fahad Specialist Hospital Dammam,NCT04347681,Potential Efficacy of Convalescent Plasma to Treat Severe COVID-19 and Patients at High Risk of Developing Severe COVID-19,King Fahad Specialist Hospital Dammam,2,1,Convalescent Plasma for COVID 19,Other,convalescent plasma from recovered COVID 19 donor,Treatment,,"Coronavirus disease ( COVID-19 ) pandemic has started to affect Saudi Arabia and is expected to cause a lot of morbidities and many patients , especially the elderly , will require intensive care unit ( ICU ) support to survive as its lethality increases with the increasing age . Development of a vaccine by pharmaceutical companies like Roche and antibody concentrates from convalescent patients ' plasma by Takeda will take 10-12 months to complete , and we speculate that it will be overwhelmingly expensive and limited in supply . We are presenting this urgent proposal to use the convalescent plasma to save the lives of severely affected COVID-19 patients . Most of the logistic support is already available in MOH Saudi Arabia , and it will be a cheap and quick technique based on the time-tested principles of passive immunization which is supported by the most recent data from China . We are proposing to test the therapeutic potential of convalescent plasma ( from patients who have fully recovered from COVID-19 ) in treating patients with serious COVID-19 disease or those who are at risk of developing a serious disease based on their comorbidities profile . Convalescent plasma could provide our first-line defense for people with Covid-19 , especially those who are older and at a much higher risk for complications . Amid the COVID-19 pandemic , with no available vaccine or proven antiviral drug , antibodies from recovering patients could provide a `` stopgap '' measure to help in controlling the pandemic effects on health and economy . We plan to recruit at least 40 consenting donors and patients . Non-consenting patients will serve as controls .","Coronaviruses ( CoV ) are a large family of RNA viruses that cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome ( MERS-CoV ) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome ( SARS-CoV ) .1,2 The new strain of coronavirus identified in December 2019 in Wuhan city , Hubei province of China , was called 2019 novel coronavirus ( 2019- nCoV ) and has been named by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses ( ICTV ) as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus-2 ( SARS-CoV-2 ) . The ICTV have determined that SARS-CoV-2 is the same species as SARS-CoV but a different strain . The World Health Organization ( WHO ) has named the disease associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections as `` COVID-19 '' . Clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 infection typically include respiratory symptoms , fever , cough , shortness of breath and breathing difficulties . In more severe cases , the infection can cause pneumonia , severe acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) , kidney failure and even death . It is not easy to differentiate between non-SARS-CoV-2 seasonal influenza and other respiratory viruses including the locally reported MERS-CoV and H1N1 influenza viruses . SARS-CoV-2 has a higher transmission rate ( TR ) with an approximate fatality rate of 3 % . Although most of the younger patients recover after milder disease , but COVID-19 is most aggressive in the elderly population with worst pneumonia and death rates may reach 14.8 % .4 Final diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection depends on viral detection ( and if possible , exclusion of other viruses e.g . by Respiratory Viral Panel ) . Laboratory detection of the SARS-CoV2 is based on detection of viral RNA by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( rRT-PCR ) with confirmation by nucleic acid sequencing when necessary.1-5 For example , GeneFinder™ COVID-19 Plus RealAmp Kit is the One-Step Reverse Transcription Real-Time PCR Kit designed to detect the Novel Coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) qualitatively through Reverse Transcription reaction and Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction . We will use this or equivalent method to confirm the diagnosis and will repeat the rRT-PCR to make sure it has become negative in a recovered patient . As of now , no vaccine or antiviral drug coming soon , antibodies from recovering patients could provide a `` stop-gap '' measure to help in controlling the pandemic . The concept of using convalescent plasma is not new . It has been tried in limited numbers of patients during more-recent viral crises , including the 2003 SARS ( severe acute respiratory syndrome ) epidemic , the 2009 `` swine flu '' epidemic , and the 2012 outbreak of MERS ( Middle East respiratory syndrome ) .6 Convalescent plasma treatment reduced mortality in patients with severe pandemic influenza A ( H1N1 ) 2009 Virus Infection.7 Patients with a resolved viral infection will develop a polyclonal antibody immune response to different viral antigens of 2019-nCoV . Some of these polyclonal antibodies will likely neutralize the virus and prevent new rounds of infection , and the patients with resolved infection should produce 2019-nCoV antibodies in high titer . Patients with resolved cases of 2019-nCoV can simply donate plasma , and then this plasma can be transfused into infected patients.8 Given that plasma donation is well established , and the transfusion of plasma is also routine medical care , this proposal does not need any new science or medical approvals in order to be put into place . Indeed , the same rationale was used in the treatment of several Ebola patients with convalescent serum during the outbreak in 2014-2015.9 Since the emergence of this SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan , China , in December 2019 , it has rapidly spread across China and more than 188 other countries and territories . According to the WHO , as of March 27 , 2020 , there have been 540,832 confirmed cases worldwide and 24,294 deaths . SARS-CoV-2 has structural similarity to SARS-CoV that caused SARS and MERS-CoV.3 In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia , there are 1012 confirmed cases reported till now , with 3 deaths ( on March 26 , 2020 ) . The Saudi government 's prompt actions to slow down the spread of SARS-CoV-2 seem to be effective . However , CDC Estimates 40-70 % of the US population will be infected with SARS-CoV-2 . Even with curtailment measures , judging from past pandemics , approximately 40 % of human beings will be exposed to COVID-19 over the next 2-3 years . Most of these infected people will recover and almost all of them will be immune . Vigilance and readiness are needed to teach the masses about preventive measures because older people and those with comorbidities will be the sickest . Contemporaneously , therapeutic measures are highly needed from the medical community to treat COVID-19 patients .",2020-04-08,"November 14, 2021","Inclusion Criteria : s Recipients : We will use the confirmed case definition of SARS-CoV-2 infection ( COVID-19 ) with POSITIVE rRT PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 `` using one of the SFDA approved kit used in KSA '' as per current MOH / SCDPC ( Waqayah ) guidelines ( derived from WHO and CDC ) . 18 or older Patient with COVID 19 confirmed as per case definition of CDC or MOH/Waqayah Must have been requiring ICU care or severe or immediately life-threatening care : i .

In-vitro data show that hydroxychloroquine can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 [ 1 ] replication and anecdotal reports from Chinese COVID-19 patients [ 2 , 3 ] suggest that chloroquine is a good candidate for treatment . No data have been published and reported evidence is based on non-controlled use of hydroxychloroquine . The aim of this placebo-controlled trial is to assess the effect of hydroxychloroquine on duration of symptoms in mild COVID-19 patients and time of virus shedding as an important tool to reduce the risk of further community transmissions . This data will inform practice for the design of larger trials on clinical efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in the treatment and post- and preexposure prophylaxis of COVID-19 and as a tool for reduction of community transmission .","The study is a double-blinded randomized placebo controlled multicentric trial . The trial is expected to be conducted from April to January 2021 . The duration for each individual subject includes 7 days study treatment and 21±2 days of follow-up after the last study treatment administration time . Adult male and female patients with positive COVID-19 diagnosis and fulfilling the outlined eligibility criteria will be enrolled into the study . Trial population will consist of both genders . Gender distribution in the trial is supposed to reflect the distribution in the real patient 's population , there will be no prior defined quantitative ratio between females and males . All consenting and eligible adult patients with virologically confirmed COVID-19 will be recruited and randomly and double-blindly ( patient and investigators ) allocated in a 1:1 ratio to either IMP or placebo . Each patient will be given a first dose of 600mg IMP ( hydroxychloroquine or placebo ) at the day of inclusion at the study site . This amount corresponds to 3 capsules . From the 2nd day on , each patient will take 600mg once a day until day 7 ( 6 more doses of 600mg ) at home and will document it in an online form or , when not possible , in a diary . IMP will be given to the patients orally . To mask the IMP versus placebo the original tables will be encapsulated in a film coated tablet .

Centre Chirurgical Marie Lannelongue,NCT04347980,Dexamethasone Treatment for Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Induced by COVID-19,Centre Chirurgical Marie Lannelongue,3,0,"Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Adult",Drug,Dexamethasone and Hydroxychloroquine,Treatment,Single,Single blind randomized clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy of the combination of hydroxychloroquine and dexamethasone as treatment for severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ( ARDS ) related to coronavirus disease 19 ( COVID-19 ) . We hypothesize that dexamethasone ( 20 mg for 5 days followed by 10 mg for 5 days ) combined with 600 mg per day dose of hydroxychloroquine for 10 days will reduce the 28-day mortality compared to hydroxychloroquine alone in patients with severe ARDS related COVID-19 .,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic causing COVID-19 disease affects hundreds of thousands of patients . Of these , 5 % will present with acute respiratory failure , the most severe form of which is Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ( ARDS ) . Hospital mortality affects 45 % of patients with severe ARDS . The improvement in mortality associated with ARDS seems largely explained by the reduction in lesions induced by mechanical ventilation , in particular a tidal volume ( Vt ) set at 6 ml / kg of the weight predicted by the size associated with a plateau pressure must not exceed 30 cm of water . Unfortunately and despite the application of these recommendations , ARDS related COVID-19 is associated with a mortality of 65 % . About 42 % of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonitis will develop ARDS and the onset of ARDS is rapid after admission with a median of 2 days . Interestingly , a study reported that patients suffering from ARDS and having received corticosteroids had a mortality rate of 46 % ( 23 out of 50 ) compared to 61.8 % ( 21 out of 34 ) in patients who did not receive corticosteroids . However , this difference was not significant ( P = 0.15 ) . The survival curve showed , however , that the administration of corticosteroids ( Methylprednisolone ) reduced the risk of death ( Hazard ratio : 0.38 ( 95 % confidence interval 0.20-0.72 ) ; P = 0.003 ) . The authors concluded that a randomized study was necessary to confirm this impression . The theoretical justification for treatment with corticosteroids is related to the recognition of the inflammatory syndrome as a factor in the development of an uncontrolled and harmful fibroproliferative phase . It seems certain that late administration ( beyond the 14th day after the start of ARDS ) is deleterious in patients by increasing mortality . However , a recent study shows that early administration of dexamethasone ( within 30 hours after the start of ARDS ) is associated with an increase of ventilator-free days and a decrease in mortality at 2 months . In COVID-19 disease , there is also a cytokine storm and an intense inflammatory reaction . Currently the use of corticosteroids is not recommended during a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection . Administration of corticosteroids may delay elimination of the virus . Recently , a preliminary study reported that the administration of hydroxychloroquine ( 200mg x3 per day ) decreased or even made disappear the viral load . This clinical study appears to corroborate an experimental study . However , hydroxychloroquine can have cardiac toxicity which , although rare , can be serious . In summary : The appearance of an ARDS during a COVID-19 is burdened with a mortality of 65 % The viral load has decreased when ARDS is present The use of hydroxychloroquine makes it possible to significantly reduce the viral load Early administration of corticosteroids seems beneficial in ARDS",2020-04-09,"August 6, 2021","Inclusion Criteria : Patient over 18 years old Patient affiliated to a health insurance plan Patient who has given their free , informed and written consent or patient for whom an independent doctor has given their signed consent as part of an emergency procedure Kaliemia > 3,5 mmol / L Patient diagnosed COVID-19 positive by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) and / or CT The diagnosis of COVID-19 will be made if : Patient with radiological images strongly suggestive of a chest scan associated with respiratory symptoms , without other obvious etiologies OR Patient with suggestive respiratory symptoms associated with a positive RT-PCR Patients admitted to intensive care with acute respiratory distress syndrome secondary to COVID-19 , intubated for less than 5 days with : Either - Hypoxemia defined by a arterial partial pressure of oxygen / fraction of inspiratory oxygen ratio ( PaO2 / FiO2 ) ratio < 100 after 2 sessions of prone position Either - An alteration in pulmonary compliance ( tidal volume divided by plateau pressure minus positive expiratory pressure ) immediately or over the first 96 hours after the start of ARDS defined by : immediately : impossibility of maintaining a plateau pressure 20 mg / day ) or Hydroxychloroquine Immunocompromised patients : AIDS , bone marrow or solid organ transplant recipients Pregnant women Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase ( G6PD ) deficiency",5,0,18 Years,80 Years

Implementation of healthy eating behavior has been identified as a barrier to T2DM treatment and efficacy . The determinants of eating behavior and weight regulation involve a complex interaction among individual-level homeostatic , hedonic , and genetic systems , and the external food environment . The high prevalence of obesity and T2DM suggests hedonic motivation to consume food overrides homeostatic satiation signaling , resulting in excess food intake . Elevated intake increases body mass and promotes T2DM incidence via dysregulation of glucagon-like peptide 1 ( GLP-1 ) , amylin , and adiponectin , which in turn can negatively impact T2DM treatment options . Use of a pharmaceutical , such as bromocriptine , to aid in behavioral change is a novel method for treating and ameliorating T2DM and warrants investigation given that previous work has shown reward response to food images mediates T2DM control . Use of functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) techniques to predict and evaluate hedonically-motivated eating behavior can be used to measure sensitivity to reward , and the role it plays in developing obesity , and is therefore an excellent tool to examine the associations among bromocriptine , satiety hormones , reward sensitivity and eating behavior . Moreover , since 20-35 % of the population carries the DRD2 TaqIA A1 allele , and 65 % of the population is overweight or obese and at high risk for T2DM development or currently diagnosed , as much as 23 % of the population may greatly benefit from dopamine agonist treatment . Despite the possibility that bromocriptine may have robust impact on T2DM treatment or as prevention therapy in those that are genetically predisposed , few data are available that directly examine the three systems ( homeostatic , hedonic , genetic ) available to assess whether a genetically-informed , personalized T2DM treatment is viable .",2022-05-31,"August 12, 2022","Inclusion Criteria : Baseline BMI between 25 and 35 Exclusion Criteria : Individuals with current fMRI contraindications ( e.g. , metal implants , braces ) Probable current Axis I psychopathology ( e.g. , major depression disorder , panic disorder , generalized anxiety disorder , bipolar disorder ) Habitual use of cigarettes or illicit drugs Pregnancy or breastfeeding Diagnosis of serious medical problems ( e.g. , diabetes , cardiovascular disease , stroke ) Current weight loss dieting and/or weight fluctuations great than 10 lbs in the previous 6 weeks Do not consume dairy Allergy to bromocriptine , dairy , and nuts",55,0,18 Years,35 Years

University of Leicester,NCT04219124,"The Effect of a SGLT2 Inhibitor on Glucose Flux, Lipolysis and Exercise in Type 2 Diabetes",University of Leicester,4,1,Type 2 Diabetes,Drug,IMP oral tablet,Other,Double,"The study is a randomised double blind placebo control cross over trial with 4 weeks washout period . The expected duration of participant participation is 103 days . the study aims to investigate the effect of dapagliflozin , a SGLT2 inhibitor , on glucose flux , lipolysis and exercise in patients with type 2 diabetes .","SGLT2 inhibitors are a new class of drug that have a novel mechanism of action by promoting urinary glucose excretion to lower blood glucose levels . The recent observations that ketogenesis or episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis seem to be of higher frequency in patients with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes on SGLT2 inhibitors , is of considerable worldwide interest . SGLT2 inhibitors seem to be associated with euglycemic DKA and ketosis , perhaps because of their noninsulin-dependent glucose clearance , hyperglucagonemia , and volume depletion . There have been two papers that have looked at this in some detail . One is a metabolic study by Ferrannini et al and a review paper by Yabe et al . The central question that needs to be raised is whether the observed effects are solely due to the SGLT2 inhibitors masking elevations in blood glucose in insulin deficient states , or whether there is some metabolic effect of the SGLT2 inhibitors that make episodes more likely to occur . There is increasing evidence to suggest that the SGLT2 inhibitors are affecting metabolism in several ways and that these may contribute to the risk of ketoacidosis . Ferrannini et al have shown that , on chronic usage , lipid oxidation rates change and thus the body appears to have a homeostatic response to losing glucose by switching metabolism more in favour of free fatty acids . It is also possible that protein and other metabolites are also involved in this process but these have never been studied . Recent trials of newer glucose-lowering agents have been neutral on the primary Cardiovascular ( CV ) outcome . However , patients with type 2 diabetes at high risk for cardiovascular events who received empagliflozin , as compared with placebo , had a lower rate of the primary composite cardiovascular outcome and of death from any cause when the study drug was added to standard care . This may be a class effect and is of high importance to explore the effects of SGLT2 inhibitor effect on cardiovascular function . Aim : To study the metabolic adaptions that take place following chronic administration of SGLT2 inhibitors in people with Type 2 diabetes and to establish whether these adaptations contribute to the development of ketoacidosis . Study procedure : The recruitment phase will commence as soon as there is ethical , HRA , research governance and regulatory approval and only after the Sponsor 'green light ' has been issued . Recruitment : From Diabetes Clinics at Cedar centre , Royal Surrey County Hospital and additional locations : local GP practices , other healthcare settings including but not limited to outpatient clinics , retinal screening , podiatry , diabetes patient groups , University of Surrey staff .

The following measurements will be taken before and during/after exercise : Plasma non-esterified fatty acid concentrations , atrial natriuretic peptide , noradrenaline and adrenaline ( n=8 for each measurement ) Plasma glucose , insulin and growth hormone concentrations ( n=8 for each measurement ) Ketone body and metabolite concentrations ( n=8 for each measurement ) ECG trace BP , HR and Rate Pressure Product ( RPP=HR * SBP ) Calculated substrate oxidation recorded as VO2 ml/min and VCO2 ml/min and resting energy requirement ( RER ) Capillary lactate concentration Visit 4 and 6 : The Metabolic Assessment Day ( 8-10 hours ) Participants will have taken the randomised study treatment daily for 28 days prior to visit 4 and 6 . Blood glucose study diaries will be collected at visit 4 and 6 . Hypoglycaemia events will be reviewed . Data from their home glucose monitoring will not be collected for further analysis . Participants should refrain from alcohol and strenuous exercise for 24hours prior to any metabolic assessment day . If female of childbearing age , a urine pregnancy test will be undertaken prior to the commencement of any metabolic study activity . Blood pressure and heart rate will be recorded . Participants will be asked to return their unused IMP at visit 4 and visit 6 . They will be prescribed the IMP required for the second arm of the study depending on the randomisation code . Participants will have a standardised meal the evening before the metabolic assessment day and will attend the clinical research unit at 7.00am on the morning of the assessment day after an overnight fast . Blood glucose concentration will be measured using a glucose oxidase technique on a glucose analyser ( YSI 2300 Clandon Scientific , Yellow Springs Instruments , Yellow Springs , Ohio , USA ) . Hydration may be maintained by insertion of an intravenous fluid drip . All blood samples will be separated immediately using a centrifuge ( Heraeus Labofuge 400 centrifuge , Thermo Fisher Scientific . UK ) and the plasma stored at -20°c at the Cedar centre overnight and then transferred to a minus -80°c freezer at the University of Surrey for analysis later at the University of Surrey . Metabolic Assessment Day Blood samples will be as shown in Appendix A . The samples will be used for measuring different metabolites and hormones at various time points . Intravenous cannulae will be inserted into the antecubital fossa of each arm : one for blood taking at time -15 minutes and the other for the infusion of the isotopes [ 6,6 ] - 2H2 glucose and [ 1,1,2,3,3 ] - 2H5 glycerol at time 360 minutes . Two fasting samples will be taken at -10 and 0 for the baseline isotope enrichment for glucose , glycerol and palmitate and NEFA and ketone body concentrations and various hormone concentrations . At 0 minutes the study medication will be taken and a stable isotope of U-13C palmitate ( 200mg ) in 30 ml olive oil will be ingested in less than 2 minutes after which blood samples will be taken for palmitate enrichment and concentration in TAG and NEFA pools and TAG and NEFA concentrations . A primed infusion of stable isotope of glucose and glycerol will be given from 360 to 480 minutes and the concentration and enrichment of both glucose and glycerol will be measured from 450 minutes to 480 minutes . Samples will be taken for glucose concentration throughout the study . Blood samples for acetoacetate concentration and beta-hydroxybutyrate enrichment and concentration will be taken . One blood sample will be taken at 480 minutes for targeted metabolomics and cardiac biomarkers . Blood samples for will also be taken for insulin , glucagon and cortisol . Patients will be asked to empty their bladder and urine will be collected to analyse glucose excretion at 120 , 360 , 450 and 480 minutes ( 4 samples ) . A Transthoracic Echocardiogram and pulse wave velocity will be completed during the metabolic assessment day . This can be done at any time point during the metabolic assessment day . On completion of the metabolic assessment day , participants will be reminded that they have the telephone number for the research team that can be used 24hours a day ( identification card ) and will be advised not to drive home . There will be a minimum period of a 28-day drug wash out period before starting the second arm of the study . The participant will be dispensed with trial medication for the second arm at visit 4 . A date will be agreed for visit 5 and 6 to allow the study doctor to advise when the participant should to start taking the study medication in preparation for visit 5 and 6 . Telephone Visits 1 and 2 The research team will contact the participant the day after each metabolic assessment day to ensure glucose levels have normalised . This may be a Saturday if a metabolic study is conducted on a Friday . Telephone Visit 3 Once participants have completed both metabolic assessments days the participant will have completed the research study protocol . Each participant will receive a follow up check on well-being 2-4 weeks after completion of the last metabolic assessment day and will continue their diabetes care with their usual diabetes doctor . If a participant withdraws from the study , all samples will be destroyed but the anonymised data collected up to the point of withdrawal will be used unless explicitly stated by the participant . The study doctor may also decide that it is no longer appropriate for a participant to continue with the study . This will happen if they no longer meet the requirements for the study or exclusion criteria become apparent . The participant will be required to withdraw from the study if they become pregnant or lose capacity to follow the study procedures and provide consent to continue .",2020-01-02,"April 26, 2021","Inclusion Criteria : • Able in the opinion of the investigator , and willing to give informed consent obtained before any study-related activities .

Massachusetts General Hospital,NCT04356937,Efficacy of Tocilizumab on Patients With COVID-19,Massachusetts General Hospital,3,1,SARS-CoV 2,Drug,Tocilizumab,Treatment,Double,"This is a randomized , double blind , multi-center study to evaluate the effects of tocilizumab compared to placebo on patient outcomes in participants with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and evidence of systemic inflammation . The aim of this study is to test the effect of Tocilizumab on multi-organ dysfunction in a phase 3 randomized controlled trial among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection . Specifically , as compared to placebo , we will test whether tocilizumab is associated with a reduction in multi-organ dysfunction among hospitalized COVID-19 adult patients with elevated inflammatory measures . Multi-organ dysfunction will be measured as the incidence of the following composite endpoint ( mechanical ventilation , renal replacement therapy , mechanical support , need for inotropes or vasopressors , liver dysfunction ( increased bilirubin ) , and all-cause mortality ) . We will also assess multiple pre-specified secondary ( exploratory ) endpoints and safety endpoints . We hypothesize that , as compared to placebo , tocilizumab will reduce transfer to the ICU , need for mechanical ventilation , increase rates of hospital discharge in patients diagnosed with severe COVID-19 infection and evidence of exaggerated inflammatory response .","As of April 3 , 2020 , COVID-19 has been confirmed in over 1 million people worldwide , with an estimated symptomatic case fatality ratio of around 1.4 % . Currently without an effective treatment for SARS-CoV-2 there is an urgent need for effective treatment to curtail the rate of respiratory failure , the leading cause of mortality in COVID-19 disease . Moreover , with increasing numbers of patients requiring intensive unit level care and mechanical ventilation , nations are already having to triage patients for ventilatory support due to limited resources and healthcare systems around the world being stretched to the point of collapse , highlighting the importance of identifying interventions that could prevent the development of respiratory failure for these patients . The disease course of COVID-19 includes an incubation period , an acute viral phase that most commonly presents with flu-like symptoms that in some individuals progresses to a severe hyperinflammatory phase marked by acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) and hypoxemic respiratory failure.Though there is spectrum of clinical course , many progress to the hyperinflammatory phase around day seven of symptoms , often requiring intensive care unit ( ICU ) level care and mechanical ventilation . Accumulating evidence suggests that the pathophysiology underlying this profound decline is a severe inflammatory response as demonstrated by multi organ system dysfunction akin to cytokine release syndrome ( CRS ) /macrophage activation syndrome ( MAS ) .CRS/MAS is a systemic hyperinflammatory syndrome on a spectrum with secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis ( sHLH ) , typically characterized by multiorgan failure that is often triggered by viral infections in the setting of excessive immune activation , typically with marked hyperferritinemia.Postmortem assessment of patients with COVID-19 have demonstrated pathologic findings consistent with MAS such as mono/lymphocytic infiltrates within the lung parenchyma with associated edema and alveolar congestion , splenic necrosis with macrophage proliferation and hemophagocytosis , as well as a lymphocyte/histiocyte predominate infiltrate of portal vasculature accompanying liver necrosis and sinusoidal congestion.Cytokine profiling of patients with MAS/sHLH overlaps with that seen in patients with severe COVID-19 and includes elevated levels of IL-1 , IL-2 , IL-7 , IL-6 , G-CSF , MCP- 1 , and TNF-α as well as elevated D-dimer , C-reactive protein , LDH and troponins.Moreover , preliminary data from a non-randomized series of COVID-19 patients with `` severe or critical COVID-19 '' from China who were treated with tocilizumab ( in addition to standard therapies ) showed they had dramatic improvement in fever , arterial oxygen saturation and inflammatory markers within the first 24-hours following administration . Taken together , these data strongly suggest an immunologic link between COVID-19 and immune dysregulation resulting in MAS . Clinical trials are already underway studying the role of immunomodulatory therapy including modulation of IL-1 and IL-6 and downstream pathways in the setting of CAR-T induced MAS ( NCT04150913 , NCT04071366 ) and agents such anakinra and tocilizumab have been used in this context with promising results and good safety profiles . There is an urgent and dire need to study the therapeutic role for immunomodulatory therapy in COVID-19 disease to both halt disease progression in patients at an individual level and prevent the inevitable saturation of healthcare resources at a systems level , to which end there are numerous ongoing international trials to expand these efforts into the setting of COVID-19 infection ( ChiCTR2000029765 , NCT04324021 , TOCOVID-19 ) . Based on the MGH experience thus far with COVID-19 , including over 200 patients to date , the need for mechanical ventilation has been approximately 30 % . With the upcoming surge anticipated between April 17th and 21st we expect the need for hundreds of additional ICU beds . Investigators propose a trial of IL-6 receptor blockade with tocilizumab given early in disease course to try to prevent progression of COVID-19 .",2020-04-19,"July 23, 2021","Inclusion criteria : Subjects who meet all of the following criteria will be eligible to participate in the study : Must have provided informed consent in a manner approved by the Investigator 's Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) or Independent Ethics Committee ( IEC ) prior to any assessments .

The study design is a randomized ( 5 days of medication v. 5 days of placebo ) clinical trial initiated immediately after diagnosis in ambulatory health care workers at University of South Alabama Health , or in ambulatory USA patients . At 7 days after enrollment another nasopharyngeal swab will be taken to measure if the virus is still present . At 10 weeks we will measure immunity from Covid-19 using a single blood sample . It is a phase 2/3 clinical trial .","Hydroxychloroquine ( HCQ ) , which is a less toxic derivative of chloroquine ( CQ ) , has been shown to be effective in inhibiting Covid-19 infection in vitro . The evidence from clinical research trials is sparse and has many flaws . Much of the Chinese experience with Chloroquine comes from a letter to the editor and a news briefing/conference held on February 15 , 2020 . The letter describes experience with more than 100 patients treated with CQ in multicenter clinical trials but the letter provides no quantitative data to back their claims . At least one non-randomized clinical trial has been performed in Europe .

Written informed consent was obtained after the nature of the study had been fully explained to the patient . Recruitment took place from October 2018 to October 2019 . The study received the local Institutional Review Board approval and all procedures are in accordance with the ethical standards as stated in the Helsinki Declaration . A total of 59 patients were recruited for the study . Subjects were randomised into three groups : control ( n=19 ) , card only ( n=20 ) , card and tele-reminder ( n=20 ) with an allocation ratio of 1:1:1 . ( Figure 1 ) . Sample size was calculated based on similar drug adherence studies powered to detect a true difference in adherence rates with power at 80 % and alpha at 5 % - 20 patients per group were required . The personalised card was printed by the attending ophthalmologist for the patient via a web accessible software we have developed . The software allowed the reviewing physician to select the medications the patient was prescribed and auto-generate a personalised card that will be sent to the network printer . The card illustrated the patient 's eye drop regime in a simple pictorial format using coloured pictures of the eye drop bottles and universally recognised symbols . It can be folded to a compact size of 11cm x 7.5cm to allow patients to carry around in their wallets . This card will be given to patients at the end of their consult and explanation will be provided by the attending physician who will manually tick in the corresponding boxes depending on the frequency of administration . Patients who were recruited into the group receiving tele-monitoring were contacted via text messages daily by a programmed software at the scheduled time of eye drop administration . They were required to acknowledge the reminder by replying a 'Yes ' if they had administered the eyedrop and 'No ' if they had not . A nil reply was taken as a 'No ' . Trained research assistants and a medical student administered the pre-implementation baseline adherence questionnaire in-person after informed consent was obtained . The questionnaire included questions on ( i ) demographics ( ii ) barriers to adherence and ( iii ) Morisky adherence scale . The demographic information included age , gender , length of time using glaucoma medications , number of glaucoma medications , educational level , whether they identify the medications by name or colour and who helps with the eye drop instillation . In the second section on barriers to adherence , participants were asked to use a visual analogue scale to rate the importance of 11 commonly cited reasons that make it `` hard for patients to take glaucoma eye drops . '' The visual analog scale had 5 major hatch marks anchored between `` strongly disagree '' and `` strongly agree . '' In the third section of the questionnaire , participants completed the Morisky Adherence Scale , a validated instrument for measuring self-reported adherence which was targeted for glaucoma medications in this study . The interventions in both the card and tele-reminder groups were administered for a period of 6 weeks , following which a post-implementation adherence questionnaire was conducted via a telephone call by the same research assistants and medical student . The questionnaire included the same questions on the Morisky adherence scale as per the pre-implementation questionnaire .",2020-03-16,"March 19, 2020","Inclusion Criteria : Patients who have been treated for glaucoma for at least 3 months Using a total of three or more eye drops , at least two of which are ocular hypotensive A minimum visual acuity of 6/60 or better Aged 30 to 90 years old Exclusion Criteria : Patients who just started on glaucoma treatment Patients who are on less than 3 eyedrops Patients with vision worse than 6/60",59,0,30 Years,90 Years

Parc de Salut Mar,NCT04316598,Cannabis Effects on Electroencephalography,Parc de Salut Mar,1,0,Healthy Volunteers,Drug,Cannabis Sativa,Other,Triple,"Background : Tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC ) is a partial CB1/CB2 agonist and causes its pharmacological effects by binding to cannabinoid receptors . CB1 receptors are predominantly located in the brain ( highest densities at hippocampus , cerebellum and the striatum ) and at low levels in the brainstem . CB2 receptors are predominantly in the spleen and in hematopoietic cells . THC is highly lipophilic and is readily absorbed and distributed to the brain and other organs . Most of the neuropsychological studies carried out so far show that the mainly affected neurocognitive functions in cannabis users are : memory , attention , psychomotor capacity , speed of information processing and alterations of executive functions ( resistance to interference , planning capacity , decision-making , verbal fluency and working memory ) . These effects are dose-dependent . Hypothesis : Functional CB1 receptor activation by the THC contained in the cannabis flos will induce dose-dependent effects on EEG , physiological functions and behavior : EEG alterations . Increase in cannabis subjective effects . Increase in heart rate . Increase in psychopathology scale Psychotomimetic State Inventory ( PSI ) score . Increase in plasma cortisol concentrations . Objectives : Main pharmacodynamic objective : To assess the effects of Cannabis flos on electroencephalography ( EEG ) in healthy recreational cannabis users . Secondary pharmacodynamic objectives : ( i ) To assess the effects of Cannabis flos on : cannabis subjective effects , heart rate and psychopathology scale ; ( ii ) To establish the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationships between THC plasma concentrations and pharmacodynamic endpoints . Safety and tolerability objectives : To assess the safety and tolerability of THC in these subjects . Methods : Phase I , prospective , monocentric , double-blind , randomized , placebo-controlled , parallel group study to assess the THC effects on EEG neural oscillations in 16 healthy subjects with recreational cannabis use .","Subjects will be randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to either Arm A ( Cannabis ) or Arm B ( Cannabis placebo ) . The subjects , Investigators and designees involved in the conduct of the study will be blinded to the identity of the treatment administered during the study . In the active group ( Arm A ) subjects will be administered four single doses of 20 mg THC over 3 days , equivalent to 285.7 μg/kg . This dose is considered to be sufficient for eliciting the psychoactive effects of THC ( > 5 ng/mL in plasma ) and modify EEG , avoiding subjects to be too much behaviorally impaired . THC will be administered in the form of medical cannabis ( Bedrocan® ) inhaled by intrapulmonary route . It is featured in flos form ( Cannabis sativa dried female flower ) containing THC 22 % and cannabidiol ( CBD ) < 1 % . A vaporization system ( Mighty® Medic device ) will be used for cannabis administration . Through this system , the final inhalation of THC is comparable to that of smoking cannabis while reducing the inhalation of toxic and irritating substances generated in the combustion of herbs .",2020-03-18,"July 29, 2020","Inclusion Criteria : Healthy male or female subjects .

Patients are scheduled for an initial 6 weekly treatments , a further 6 weekly treatments for non-responders and a followup 10 monthly treatments for responders . Complete response will be defined as histological disappearance of malignancy on bladder biopsy and resolution of abnormal cytological findings after treatment . Time to first recurrence , time to progression , overall survival , and disease-specific survival wil be estimated by use of the Kaplan-Meier method .","Partecipants Inclusion criteria : Patients with urothelial high risk NMIBC ( high grade stage Ta , T1 and/or carcinoma in situ ) after intravesical BCG failure ; adequate bone marrow reserve ; normal renal function ; normal liver function ; Karnofsky performance score of 50 to 100 . Exclusion criteria : non-urothelial carcinomas of the bladder ; known allergy to MMC ; previous or concomitant urothelial carcinoma of the upper urinary tract and urethra , or both ; bladder capacity less than 200 mL ; untreated urinary-tract infection ; severe systemic infection ( ie , sepsis ) ; urethral strictures that would prevent endoscopic procedures and catheterisation ; other concurrent chemotherapy , radiotherapy , and treatment with biological response modifiers ; other malignant diseases within 5 years of start of EMDA MMC ( except for adequately treated basal-cell or squamous-cell skin cancer , in situ cervical cancer ) ; pregnancy ; psychological , familial , sociological , or geographical factors that would preclude study participation . The institutional review boards of each participating centre approved the study design . all enrolled patients will sign an informed consent form , approved by the institutional review boards , providing details of treatments . BCG Failure The definition of BCG failure in patients has been proposed as follows : BCG-refractory disease when there is failure to achieve a disease-free state at 6 months following initial BCG therapy with either maintenance or retreatment at 3 months because of persistent or rapidly recurrent tumor ; BCG-resistant disease when there is recurrence or persistence at 3 months following an induction cycle ; BCG-relapsing disease when the disease recurs after the patient is disease-free for 6 months ; BCG-intolerant disease when the disease recurs following administration of a less than adequate course of therapy because of a serious adverse event or symptomatic intolerance that requires discontinuation of further BCG therapy.13 Study design Patients will underwent : upper urinary tract imaging , urinary cytology of the bladder and upper urinary tract ; random cold-cup biopsies of the bladder and prostatic urethra-ie , sampling of seemingly healthy urothelium and of suspicious areas ; and complete transurethral resection ( TUR ) of all bladder tumour visible on endoscopy , ensuring muscle was included in resected samples . All patients will underwent re-staging TUR 4-5 weeks later . All clinical assessors are adequately trained in the above procedures , and no methods are used to enhance the quality of measurements . All biopsy samples of tumour and bladder will be reviewed by a pathologist for stage and grade . Tumour stage are classified according to the 1997 TNM classification of the International Union Against Cancer , and tumour grade was defined in accordance with the 1973 WHO classification . Treatment schedule All patients will start induction EMDA/MMC of 6 intravesical treatments at weekly intervals commencing 2-3 weeks after re-staging TUR . Intravesical EMDA MMC is given by a battery-powered generator delivering a controlled electric current that passes between the active intravesical electrode integrated into a specific transurethral catheter and dispersive ground electrodes on skin of the lower abdomen ( Physion srl , Mirandola , Italy ) . Patients are placed on fluid restriction and 2 g ingested sodium bicarbonate the night before treatment , the morning of treatment , and 2 h before treatment with mitomycin . The bladder is emptied through the electrode-transurethral-catheter and 40 mg mitomycin dissolved in 100 mL water was infused intravesically by gravity and retained in the bladder for 30 min , while 20 mA for 30 min pulsed electric current was given externally . Two dispersive cathode electrodes were placed on lower abdominal skin that had been degreased with alcohol . The bladder was then emptied and the catheter removed . Patients who were disease-free 3 months after treatment were scheduled to receive monthly infusions of BCG for 10 months . Maintenance treatment was given to the same dose and methods of infusion as initial allocated treatment . Response to treatment was assessed with abdominal ultrasonography , cystoscopy , and urinary cytology . In patients who were free of disease 3 months after treatment , these assessments were done every 3 months during the first 3 years and every 6 months thereafter . Patients with carcinoma in situ underwent abdominal ultrasonography , cystoscopy , urinary cytology , and random bladder biopsies at 3 months and 6 months . If bladder cytology was positive for cancer cells but no lesions were visible on cystoscopy , cytology of the upper urinary tract and random biopsies of the bladder and prostatic urethra were done . If , at 3 months ' follow-up , carcinoma in situ persisted or a superficial tumour recurred ( ie , stage pTa tumour confined to the urothelium or stage pT1 with invasion of the lamina propria ) , the patient underwent multiple , random biopsy sampling and TUR of all bladder tumour visible on endoscopy and received a second course of intervention treatment . Cystoscopy , biopsies , and urinary cytology were repeated 3 months after the start of the second course . Patients who were disease-free after the second course of treatment received the full course of monthly maintenance instillations ( ie , one infusion of electromotive mitomycin for 10 ) . Patients were suspended from the trial on a second recurrence , on persistence of carcinoma in situ , on development of carcinoma in the upper-urinary tract or prostatic urethra , on progression to muscle-invasive disease ( ie , stage pT2 or more advanced ) , or on development of metastases . Further treatment was left to the discretion of the local investigator . Toxicity Side effects were classified as local , systemic or allergic . Local toxicity was defined as culture proven bacterial cystitis , drug induced ( chemical ) cystitis and other localized effects . Systemic side effects were defined as fever exceeding 38C , general malaise and fatigue . Skin rash was regarded as allergic reaction . The severity of side effects were classified by the treating physician , with subsequent decision to continue , delay or abandon treatment . Patient follow-up . Response to treatment was assessed with cystoscopy , urinary cytology and /or biopsy only if indicated by suspicious cytological findings or on cystoscopy . In disease-free cases , cystoscopy and urinary cytology were repeated at 3-month intervals for 2 years , 6-month intervals for 3 years and yearly thereafter . Patient evaluation Patients with stage pTa and pT1 tumour without carcinoma in situ are classified as disease-free and therefore treated prophylactically ; those with carcinoma in situ are treated therapeutically , and response is scored as no response or as complete response . Complete response is defined as complete disappearance of carcinoma in situ , as documented by a normal cytology , cystoscopy , and random bladder biopsies . The primary endpoint is disease-free interval for patients without carcinoma in situ and for patients with carcinoma in situ who are disease-free after treatment-ie , time from enrollment to first cystoscopy noting recurrence . Patients with carcinoma in situ who did not have complete response after 3 months of treatment are regarded as having recurrence with no follow-up . The secondary endpoints are time to progression , overall survival , and disease specific survival . Time to progression is defined as time from randomisation until the onset of muscle invasive disease as recorded by pathological assessment of TUR samples or biopsy samples . Overall survival is defined as time from enrollment until death from any cause ; disease specific survival as time from enrollment until death from bladder cancer . Patients without recurrence or progression are censored at the last cystoscopy , and those lost to follow-up were censored at the last known day of survival . Statistical Analysis All analyses are done by intention to treat . Time to first recurrence , time to progression , overall survival , and disease-specific survival are estimated by use of the Kaplan-Meier method . Comparisons are estimated by use of log-rank test . All tests are two-sided , and p < 0·05 was regarded as significant . The investigators will calculated hazard ratios with 95 % CI by use of proportional-hazards regression .",2020-03-10,"June 20, 2023","Inclusion Criteria : Patients with urothelial high risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer ( high grade stage Ta , T1 and/or carcinoma in situ ) after intravesical BCG failure ; adequate bone marrow reserve ; normal renal function ; normal liver function ; Karnofsky performance score of 50 to 100 ; Exclusion Criteria : Non-urothelial carcinomas of the bladder ; known allergy to mitomicyn ; previous or concomitant urothelial carcinoma of the upper urinary tract and urethra , or both ; bladder capacity less than 200 mL ; untreated urinary-tract infection ; severe systemic infection ( ie , sepsis ) ; urethral strictures that would prevent endoscopic procedures and catheterisation ; other concurrent chemotherapy , radiotherapy , and treatment with biological response modifiers ; other malignant diseases within 5 years of start of EMDA MMC ( except for adequately treated basal-cell or squamous-cell skin cancer , in situ cervical cancer ) ; pregnancy ; psychological , familial , sociological , or geographical factors that would preclude study participation .",52,0,18 Years,90 Years

The sensory and motor blocks will be evaluated every 5 min for 30 min or until blocks will be complete . An adequate surgical anesthesia will be defined as a motor score of ≥1 , with an absence of pinprick sensations in the area of all the four terminal nerves . The zero time for onset of sensory and motor blocks will be the completion of the LA injection . Sensory block assessment ( 0 , no block 1 , loss of sensation of pinprick 2 , loss of sensation of touch ) will be performed in the innervations of the four nerve areas , radial ( radial dorsum of the hand ) , median ( thenar eminence ) , ulnar ( hypothenar eminence ) , and intercostobrachial ( medial upper arm ) corresponding to the nerve distributions in the forearm and hand using the pinprick test , and will be compared with the same stimulation on the contra-lateral arm . The degree of motor block will be evaluated by thumb abduction ( radial nerve ) , thumb adduction ( ulnar nerve ) , and thumb opposition ( median nerve ) , using a 3-point scale ( 0 =normal motor function , 1 = decreased motor strength , 2 = complete motor block ) . The onset times of the sensory block ( the time between the end of the LA injection and the total abolition of the pinprick response ) and motor block ( time between the end of the LA injection and complete motor block ) will be recorded for each nerve . Patients who will not achieve satisfactory levels of anesthesia and will need intraoperative local infiltration will be recorded .Patient in whom the block failed and local infiltration is not enough will receive general anesthesia ( propofol 2mg/kg plus fentanyl 1ug/kg and atracurium 0.5mg/kg ) with laryngeal mask airway inserted for mechanical ventilation .

A non-randomized clinical trial was carried out in the Department of dermatology in Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Center , Karachi . All patients with mild , moderate and severe psoriasis with age above 13 years without any co-morbid , were prescribed tablet Naltrexone 6 mg daily after assessing PASI , BSA and DLQI scores before starting treatment . Patients were called monthly for follow up to monitor lipid profiles and liver function tests . After 3 months of treatment , PASI , BSA and DLQI scores were assessed again . The results were significant when analysed with paired t test in SPSS 23 .","Psoriasis is a chronic T-cell mediated disorder . The activated T cell secretes cytokines that result in keratinocytes hyper-proliferation and abnormal differentiation . These cytokines result in chemo-taxis of neutrophils and lymphocytes in skin . It is a multi-factorial disease . Individual has genetic susceptibility for psoriasis , but environmental factors trigger the disease like infections , drugs , cold , trauma and stress . It is a multi-system disease but mainly affects skin , nails and joints . It impacts adversely on patients ' quality of life , causes embarrassment , limitation in clothing choice , psychological distress which further aggravates the disease . It impacts economically due to off days from work as well . In its most common form , it presents as salmon pink plaques , covering with thick silver scales , mostly on scalp , trunk , buttocks and external surfaces of limbs . In the management of psoriasis , there are multiple treatment options which includes topical , systemic and photo-therapy . But all have their side effects and contraindication . Low dose naltrexone ( LDN ) is an attractive emergent therapy with analgesic , anti-pruritic and anti-inflammatory properties for various dermatological disorders including psoriasis . In this study , the effectiveness of low dose naltrexone in cases of psoriasis was assessed . The study was conducted in the department of dermatology in Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre , Karachi , after receiving approval letter from the institutional ethical and research committee of the hospital.Forty two patients were selected of either gender with age ranging from 13-60 years , after excluding hypertension , cardiovascular disorders , pregnancy and lactation . The procedure has been explained to each patient & written consent has been taken . Before prescribing LDN treatment , Psoriasis area and severity index ( PASI ) , Body surface area ( BSA ) and Dermatology life quality index ( DLQI ) has been calculated . Each case has prescribed tablet naltrexone 6mg daily after checking all baselines investigations of complete blood picture , renal and liver function profiles . The cases were asked to follow up monthly to observe patient compliance , response of medicine and its side effects . After 3 months of treatment , PASI , BSA and DLQI have been calculated to assess the effectiveness of treatment . PASI score is used to measure the severity and extent of disease , in terms of intensities of erythema , induration and scaling of lesion and the area of body involved with disease . Body surface area ( BSA ) is calculated through 'rule of nine ' which is a convenient and rapid method of estimating the extent of body surface area affected with disease . If BSA is 10 % , it is categorized as mild , moderate and severe disease , respectively . The dermatology life quality index is a simple questionnaire , that consists of 10 questions to assess the impact of disease and its treatment on daily activities and the impact on the social behavior of the patients . DLQI scores has been interpreted in terms of effect of disease on patients ' life as follows : 0-1 = No effect 2-5 = Small effect 6-10 = Moderate effect 11-20 = Very large effect 21-30 = Extremely large effect After 3 months , all three scores were assessed again to observe the effectiveness of treatment .

Blood samples will be be collected from 15 male or female subjects at defined time points ( 0 - 15 - 30 - 45 - 60 - 90 - 120 - 180 minutes ; 3 min at each time point ) . Individual plasma glucose , insulin and C-peptide concentrations are going to be evaluated and statistically assessed . Subjects will also be asked to complete a questionnaire regarding their digestion after oral intake of ENSO 16 or glucose defined timepoints .","This is a randomized , double-blind , active-controlled , cross-over study to assess the effect of the sugar substitute `` ENSO 16 '' on glucose metabolism parameters in healthy male or female subjects . 15 healthy subects ≥ 18 years will be included and 30 g of ENSO 16 or 30 g glucose will be orally administered to assess the impact on markers of glucose metabolism . The study medication will be dissolved in 200 mL tap water . After randomization , subjects will receive ENSO 16 ( group A ) or glucose ( group B ) on the first study day . Following a wash-out period of at least on week , subjects will receive glucose ( group A ) or ENSO 16 ( group B ) on the second study day . A screening examination ( inclusion/ exclusion criteria , medical history , etc . ) will be done on the first study day before the study medication will be administered . The study medication will be administered after an overnight fast of at least 10h . Subjects will receive a venular cannula and blood is going to be collected at 8 pre-defined timepoints ( 0 - 15 - 30 - 45 - 60 - 90 - 120 - 180 minutes ; 3 min at each time point ) . In total , 192 mL of blood are going to be collected per study participant . Study participants will also have to fill in a questionnaire to rate gastrointestinal symptoms using a checklist including the following questions : ( ( a ) abdominal pain , ( b ) nausea , ( c ) vomiting , ( d ) diarrhoea , ( e ) abdominal rumbling , ( f ) bloating , ( g ) belching and ( h ) flatulence . Participants were asked to choose between `` no symptom '' ( 0 points ) , `` mild symptoms '' ( 1 point ) and `` severe symptoms '' ( 2 points ) for each question at each time point . Primary Endpoint To test the effect of orally administered ENSO 16 ( 30 g ) or glucose ( 30 g ) on plasma glucose levels . The area under the curve ( AUC ) of plasma glucose profiles ( 0-60 min ) will be compared between different study days . Null and alternative hypotheses : H0 : There is no difference in blood glucose AUC ( 0-60 min ) between glucose and ENSO 16 . H1 : There is a difference in blood glucose AUC ( 0-60 min ) between glucose and ENSO 16 . Sample size calculation No formal sample size calculation could be performed for this trial as ENSO 16 has never been tested on glucose metabolism parameters in a clinical trial . There is evidence that sugar substitutes have to be studied separately because sweeteners differ considerably in their chemical structure and their physiologic effect on glucose metabolism . However , based on a cross-over trial with the sugar substitute xylitol at high doses , a sample size of 12 was appropriate to detect significant differences in outcome parameters . Based on these study results and on available statistical recommendations , a sample size of 15 was chosen , which is considered to be appropriate for this cross over trial to detect significant differences in the main outcome parameters if present . Statistical methodology Calculation of the AUC ( 0-60 min ) for plasma glucose , insulin and Cpeptide profiles .

These traits have the potential to improve adherence in patients who have intolerance to the integrase inhibitor class . We propose a two part study design to evaluate if patients who have suboptimal adherence due to integrase inhibitor intolerance may better tolerate Symtuza and subsequently have improved adherence .","With the advent of anti-retroviral therapy , HIV transformed into a manageable chronic disease for patients who were able to obtain medications , provided they could remain adherent to them . When single tablet regimens ( STR ) became available , adherence to HIV medications was made easier for many patients . However even years after STR became available , 38 % of patients reported they do not maintain optimal adherence to their HIV medications . While there are many factors that contribute to this problem , medication intolerance contributes to suboptimal adherence for many patients Darunavir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide ( Symtuza ) is a coformulated STR , is the only protease inhibitor based STR , and is noted for its high tolerability . This trait has the potential to improve adherence in patients who have intolerance to the integrase inhibitor class . We are not aware of any studies that have examined this potential and find that information gap worth investigating . We propose a two part study design to evaluate if patients who have suboptimal adherence due to integrase inhibitor intolerance may have better tolerability to Symtuza and subsequently have improved adherence . The initial portion of the study will consist of a self-administered adherence survey offered over a 4 month period to established patients at Midland Medical Center who are HIV+ , regardless of disease state or regimen .

Subjects found to be non-adherent due to other issues will be referred back to their provider . Subjects who are referred for screening who are on an integrase inhibitor and who do not have a contraindication will be enrolled , will complete a Patient Reported Outcome survey ( PRO ) to assess side effects/quality of life , and switched to Symtuza . Subjects who are not enrolled in the study will be referred back to their provider to address the issues with tolerance and adherence . Subjects will be followed for 4 months . During that period , they will be brought back for evaluation at the end of the first month and the end of the fourth month . At those evaluations , they will again complete the PRO and adherence surveys to assess tolerability and adherence . At the evaluations , they will also be monitored for safety and effectiveness via physical exams and laboratory studies ( Complete Blood Count , Complete Metabolic Panel , Urinalysis , CD4 panel , HIV1 Quantitative viral load ) .

A total of 108 men and women with current AUD ( moderate or severe ) and reporting intrinsic motivation to change their drinking , will be randomly assigned to receive naltrexone ( 50 mg QD ) , varenicline ( 1 mg BID ) or matched placebo . Post-randomization , all participants will complete an alcohol cue-reactivity paradigm prior to the initial dose of study medication . After a week-long medication titration period , participants will be asked to complete a 7-day practice quit attempt , during which they will have daily virtual visits ( phone and online ) where they will report on their alcohol use . Additionally , a second cue-reactivity paradigm will be conducted 90 minutes following study drug administration on final day of the practice quit attempt ( Day 14 ) .","Recruitment : Participants will be recruited from the community through online and newspaper advertisements . Campaigns in local buses and print publications ( e.g. , LA Weekly ) will also be implemented . Targeted recruitment will also take place through a lab database of previous study participants who agreed to be contacted for future studies . Telephone Screen : Individuals who call the lab ( in response to flyers and advertisements ) expressing interest in the study will receive detailed information about the study procedures , and if they remain interested they will complete a telephone screen performed by a trained research assistant for self-reported inclusion and exclusion criteria . Those who appear eligible will be invited to the laboratory for an initial in-person screening session . Initial Screening : Prior to conducting any research related procedures , research staff will conduct the informed consent process , which details the procedures to take place during the screening visit . Informed consent will be a three-part process . First , participants will be asked to read and provide verbal consent for breathalyzer . If the breathalyzer is above 0.000 , the visit will be stopped and the participant will not be compensated . The participant will be given an opportunity to reschedule the visit for another day . If the breathalyzer test is negative , the written informed consent form will be reviewed and signed by the participant and study staff outlining procedures for the initial screening visit . A second written consent form will be reviewed and signed in the presence of the study physician at the medical screening visit if the participant is found eligible to continue to that visit . At the initial screening visit , subjects will be asked to provide a urine sample to test for drugs of abuse and pregnancy ( if female ) , and will complete a series of questionnaires and interviews ( described in detail below ) to determine initial eligibility . This visit will take approximately 1 hour . Following the initial in-person screening , the study coordinator will meet with the PI to determine if the participant is eligible to continue to the medical screening based on study inclusion/exclusion criteria . Medical Screening : Those participants who appear to be eligible after the initial screening visit , will then be scheduled for a second screening visit . This visit will be conducted by the study physician and will start with a breathalyzer test . If the breathalyzer is above 0.000 , the visit will be stopped and the participant will not be compensated . The participant will be given an opportunity to reschedule the visit for another day . If the breathalyzer test is negative , the physician will conduct the second written ( experimental ) consent ; medical history interview and physical exam . In addition , a urine sample will be obtained for repeat drug screen and pregnancy tests . The participant will then be accompanied by research personnel to the CTRC for blood specimen collection including Comprehensive Metabolic Panel and Complete Blood Count to evaluate overall health ; and EKG to screen for medical conditions that could make study participation medically unsafe . The study physician will review each participant 's medical history , vital signs , weight , review of systems , and laboratory tests , including liver function tests ( LFTs ) , drug screen , chemistry screen , and urine pregnancy screen to determine if it is medically safe for the participant to take the study medication . Any subject who is excluded from the study will be compensated for their time in the screening session and will be offered referrals for alcohol treatment in the community . Randomization and Medication Titration : Participants who are eligible after the physical exam will be randomized to one of three treatment conditions ( VAR , NTX , or PLA ) . Urn randomization will be used to balance the groups by gender , smoking status ( as reported on question 1 of the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence ) , and drinking status ( 'heavy ' drinker defined as 28 or more drinks per week for males/14 or more drinks per week for females , or 'very heavy ' drinker , defined as 35 or more drinks per week for males/28 or more drinks per week for females ) . The UCLA Research Pharmacy will manage the blind . The three treatment conditions will not be different in appearance or method of administration . All participants will undergo a week-long medication titration period prior to the onset of the practice quit attempt . Practice-Quit Attempt : During the practice-quit attempt , participants will be instructed to abstain completely from drinking alcohol during a 7-day practice quit period . This period will begin on Day 8 of study medication dosing . During this period , participants will complete daily virtual visits to report on their drinking , mood and craving for alcohol during the previous day in a daily diary assessment ( DDA ) . Study Medication : On Day 1 , participants will report to the laboratory to complete the alcohol cue-reactivity paradigm and receive their first medication dose under direct observation of study staff . They will receive a 7-day supply of study medication in blister packs with AM and PM dosing clearly distinguished for the titration procedure . After reaching full medication dose at the end of one week , participants will come to the laboratory on Day 8 to begin the practice quit attempt and to take AM dose of study medication daily in the lab under direct observation of study staff . Additionally , on the first day of the practice-quit attempt ( Day 8 ) , participants will receive a second 7-day supply of study medication . All study medication will be prepared by the UCLA Research Pharmacy and will be identically matched in appearance ( opaque capsules with 50 mg of riboflavin to aid in medication compliance procedures ) and the medication labels will not reveal the drug identity . Alcohol Cue Reactivity Sessions ( CR ) : Randomized participants will complete a cue-exposure paradigm at two time points during the study , once on Day 1 prior to ingesting the first dose of study medication , and again on Day 14 , approximately 90 minutes after study drug administration . Alcohol cue exposure will follow well-established experimental procedures . Sessions will begin with a 3-minute relaxation period . Participants will then hold and smell a glass of water for 3 minutes to control for the effects of simple exposure to any potable liquid . Next , participants will hold and smell a glass of their preferred alcoholic beverage for 3 minutes . Order is not counterbalanced because of carryover effects that are known to occur . Participants ( who are smokers ) will be allowed a smoke break immediately prior to the CR assessment . After every 3 minutes of exposure , participants will rate their urge to drink on the Alcohol Urge Questionnaire ( AUQ ) and their mood on the Profile of Mood States ( POMS ) . AUQ score ( alcohol minus water ) is the primary outcome for the CR . Brief Counseling Session : All participants will meet with a trained study counselor briefly after the second cue exposure session on Day 14 to discuss their responses to the alcohol cues and discuss local treatment options . The counselor will begin by introducing him/herself and thanking the participant for his/her participation . He/she will continue by providing the participant with feedback on their responses on various individual difference measures ( drinking patterns , severity of AUD diagnosis , family history , CIWA , depression , and other drug use ) . The counselor will probe for participants ' attitudes towards these responses and diagnoses , and provide both informational and emotional support . Next , the counselor will go over the participant 's history of alcohol treatment , in order to identify potential barriers to treatment access . He/she will discuss local treatment options with the participant , including the participant 's primary care provider , self-help groups , and the UCLA Psychology Clinic . Lastly , the counselor will go over the `` Rethinking Drinking '' pamphlet with the participant , pointing out specific treatment options discussed in the session , and will address any questions or concerns .",2020-01-24,"October 10, 2022","Inclusion Criteria : Be between the ages of 21 and 65 Meet current ( i.e. , past 12-month ) DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for AUD moderate or severe Have intrinsic motivation to reduce or quit drinking ( defined as self-reported intention to reduce or quit drinking within the next 6 months ) Report drinking at least 28 drinks per week if male ( 14 drinks per week if female ) in the 28 days prior to the initial consent Have reliable internet access Exclusion Criteria : Have a current ( last 12 months ) DSM-5 diagnosis of substance use disorder for any psychoactive substances other than alcohol and nicotine Have a lifetime DSM-5 diagnosis of schizophrenia , bipolar disorder , or any psychotic disorder Have a positive urine screen for drugs other than cannabis Have clinically significant alcohol withdrawal symptoms as indicated by a score ≥ 10 on the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol-Revised ( CIWA-R ) Have an intense fear of needles or have had any adverse reactions to needle puncture Be pregnant , nursing , or planning to become pregnant while taking part in the study ; and must agree to one of the following methods of birth control ( if female ) , unless she or partner are surgically sterile : Oral contraceptives Contraceptive sponge Patch Double barrier Intrauterine contraceptive device Etonogestrel implant Medroxyprogesterone acetate contraceptive injection Complete abstinence from sexual intercourse Hormonal vaginal contraceptive ring Have a medical condition that may interfere with safe study participation ( e.g. , unstable cardiac , renal , or liver disease , uncontrolled hypertension or diabetes ) Be currently taking any psychotropic medications that , in the opinion of the investigators , compromises participant safety Be currently taking or have had previous experience with either naltrexone or varenicline Have any other circumstances that , in the opinion of the investigators , compromises participant safety",53,0,21 Years,65 Years

In addition , investigators apply the Cost-effectiveness analysis ( CEA ) as a form of economic analysis that compares the relative costs and outcomes ( effects ) for different treatment regimens on vaso-occlusive painful crisis .","`` Sickle cell disease is an inherited blood disorder characterized by defective hemoglobin ( a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen to the tissues of the body ) . Sickle cell disease involves the red blood cells , or hemoglobin , and their ability to carry oxygen . Normal hemoglobin cells are smooth , round , and flexible , like the letter `` O , '' so they can move through the vessels in our bodies easily . Sickle cell hemoglobin cells are stiff and sticky and form into the shape of a sickle , or the letter `` C , '' when they lose their oxygen . These sickle cells tend to cluster together and can not easily move through the blood vessels . The cluster causes a blockage in small arteries or capillaries and stops the movement of healthy , normal oxygen-carrying blood . This blockage is what causes the painful and damaging complications of sickle cell disease '' . `` Acute vaso-occlusive crisis ( VOC ) is a hallmark of sickle cell disease ( SCD ) .

With itch representing the most burdensome symptom in eczema , the main objectives with the lotion is fast and efficient itch relief , high tolerability , and high short- and long term safety . This phase 1 study aims to monitor skin tolerability , and how much of the active compound that is absorbed to the bloodstream .","Fexofenadine Hydrochloride Topical Lotion 1 % ( OP2101 ) is a novel formulation developed for the treatment of skin disorders characterized by pruritus . Research show that oral Fexofenadine Hydrochloride ( FX ) may lead to a small improvement of pruritus in patients with Atopic Dermatitis ( AD ) . In clinical practice , oral antihistamines are widely used off-label for pruritus relief in AD , indicating a discrepancy in trial outcomes and real-life experience . The pre-study thesis postulates that the antipruritic effect of FX can be leveraged in a dose-response relationship facilitated by high topical concentration of FX in direct contact with the pathological process of the skin . The sponsor also suggest that the Cytosolic phospholipase A2 ( cPLA2 ) blocking property of FX is an untapped resource that is likely to be dose-response dependent and manifested by means of high topical concentration in proximity to the inflammatory process . The repositioning of FX to a topical treatment has the potential for high safety , efficacy , fast relief , and ease of use .

However , some difficulties are encountered during the removal of caries due to the structural features of primary molars and the young age of the child . Therefore , in the treatment of primary molars , Atraumatic Restorative Treatment ( ART ) , in which the soft parts of the carious lesion are cleaned with the help of a sharp hand tool and restored with an adhesive glass ionomer cement ( GIC ) that releases fluoride , in the following years , the deciduous teeth were removed with a minimally invasive approach . Hall technique , in which a stainless steel crown ( SSC ) is placed without preparation for treatment , has come to the fore .","Many restorative materials , especially GIC , have been used for ART procedures , and with the advancing technology , high-viscosity glass ionomer cements with improved mechanical and chemical properties have emerged . In recent years , zinc-added HVGICs and nano-filled resin-modified HVGICs have been introduced . The Hall Technique has been suggested in the treatment of asymptomatic decayed primary molars in anxious and fearful patients to ensure patient cooperation . In this technique , it is aimed to stop the progression of caries by covering the carious deciduous molars with SSC and cutting their relationship with the oral environment , without the need for local anesthesia and tooth preparation . Thus , as the bacteria can not use the carbohydrates in the oral environment , the number of bacteria in the environment will also decrease .",2022-07-04,"July 13, 2022","Inclusion Criteria : children with no systemic disease , children who had a Frankl Behavioral Scale score 2 , children who have no occlusal problems or bad habits , children presenting between 2-5 caries lesion in primary molars .

Patients with certain risk factors seem to die by an overwhelming reaction of the immune system to the virus , causing a cytokine storm with features of Cytokine-Release Syndrome ( CRS ) and Macrophage Activation Syndrome ( MAS ) and resulting in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ( ARDS ) . Several pro-inflammatory cytokines are elevated in the plasma of patients and features of MAS in COVID-19 , include elevated levels of ferritin , d-dimer , and low platelets . There is increasing data that cytokine-targeted biological therapies can improve outcomes in CRS or MAS and even in sepsis . Tocilizumab ( TCZ ) , an anti-IL-6R biological therapy , has been approved for the treatment of CRS and is used in patients with MAS . Based on these data , it is hypothesized that TCZ can reduce mortality in patients with severe COVID-19 prone to CRS and ARDS . The overall purpose of this study is to evaluate whether treatment with TCZ reduces the severity and mortality in patients with COVID-19 .","Background and Rationale The Acute Respiratory Syndrome by Corona Virus 2 ( SARS-CoV-2 ) , first discovered in December 2019 in Wuhan/China , is causing a worldwide pandemic with potentially lethal implications on an individual basis , and , on the large scale bringing the health care systems and the economy to its limits . The mortality rate of this COronaVIrus induced Disease , COVID-19 , has been estimated by the World Health Organization ( WHO ) to be 3.7 % , which is more than 10-fold higher than the mortality of influenza . An infection with SARS-CoV-2 may cause an excessive host immune response , leading to an Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ( ARDS ) and death . Reports from China and from Italy describe an overwhelming inflammation which is triggered by the virus , causing a cytokine storm with features of Cytokine-Release Syndrome ( CRS ) and/or Macrophage Activation Syndrome ( MAS ) . Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as Interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) are elevated in the plasma of patients and features of MAS in COVID-19 include elevated levels of ferritin , d-dimer and low platelets . There is increasing evidence , that cytokine-targeted biological therapies can improve outcomes in CRS or MAS and even in sepsis . In recognition of the dramatic development of the COVID-19 pandemic , and in a pragmatic manner , already approved and safe therapies should be evaluated for the use in severe COVID-19 . Tocilizumab ( TCZ ) , an anti-IL-6R biological therapy , has been approved for the treatment of CRS and is used in patients with MAS ( and in other rheumatologic conditions like Rheumatoid Arthritis ( RA ) or Giant Cell Arteritis ( GCA ) , with a good safety profile also in the elderly ) .

Instituto Nacional de Cancerologia de Mexico,NCT04338867,Nitroglycerin Plus Intracranial Radiotherapy for Brain Metastases in NSCLC Patients,Instituto Nacional de Cancerologia de Mexico,2,1,Phase II Clinical Trial,Radiation,Whole-brain radiotherapy,Treatment,,"Background : Whole-brain radiotherapy ( WBRT ) is the standard treatment for multiple brain metastases ( BM ) , in NSCLC patients who are not candidates for treatment with stereotactic radiation body therapy . Hypoxia has been associated with chemo-radioresistance secondary to Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor ( VEGFR ) induced by Hypoxia Induced Factor ( HIF ) . Nitroglycerin ( NTG ) can reduce HIF-1 alfa in tissues , and this may have anti-angiogenic , pro-apoptotic and anti-efflux effects . In this phase II study , we evaluated the effect of transdermal nitroglycerin ( TN ) on intracranial progression-free survival ( ICPFS ) , objective response rate ( ORR ) and overall survival ( OS ) of NSCLC patients with BM . Material and methods : We performed an open-label , phase II clinical trial among ninety-six histologically confirmed NSCLC patients with BM . Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive NTG plus WBRT or WBRT alone . ORR and ICPFS were evaluated by MRI by two independent , blinded radio-oncologists .","Non-small cell Lung cancer ( NSCLC ) is the most frequent type of lung cancer worldwide . Brain metastases ( BM ) are the most frequent neurological complications related to NSCLC and it is estimated that 20 % to 40 % of these patients will present them at some point during the progression of their disease , leading to a poor prognosis . As only a selected group of NSCLC patients with single metastases or small lesions are candidates for surgical resection or SBRT , the standard treatment for multiple BM is whole-brain radiation therapy ( WBRT ) . Although 80 % of the patients who receive WRBT can initially respond to treatment , 50 % of these patients will have disease progression . This further has been related to genetic and environmental factors that may lead to radio-resistance , which is the capacity of a cell to stand the effects of radiant energy . To face this problem , other options such as chemotherapy or radio-sensitizers have shown slight benefit in terms of progression-free survival ( PFS ) but not in overall survival ( OS ) . Different studies have suggested tumor microenvironment ( TME ) has an important role in treatment response of BM-derived from melanoma and NSCLC . The demand for O2 by tumors during cancer is an unsteady phenomenon , caused by continuous metabolic profile changes , immune response activity , and TME interactions . Hypoxia occurs in most tumors and plays an important role in tumor progression . In NSCLC exists a clear relationship between hypoxia and radioresistance . Hence , there is interest into modulate TME hypoxia to improve treatment response . Hypoxia regulates the expression of genes that encode growth factors such as endothelin-1 ( ET-1 ) , growth factor-derived platelets-B ( PDGF ) and vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , as well as genes that regulate the production of gas molecules such as nitric oxide ( NO ) and carbon monoxide ( CO ) . The hypoxia-inducible factor ( HIF ) is a transcription factor that regulates the cellular response to hypoxia , functioning as a regulator of oxygen homeostasis . Several studies have shown that over-expression of HIF-1α is capable of inducing resistance to chemotherapy , radiotherapy and decreasing overall survival in NSCLC primary tumors . The administration of nitric oxide donors , such as nitroglycerin , reduces the tumor resistance related to hypoxia by inducing the direct proteolysis of HIF-1α . In tumor cells increases oxygen pressure , increased blood flow , activation of p53 and apoptosis have shown a synergistic effect with ionizing irradiation in an experimental model . According to several randomized phase II studies , the addition of transdermal nitroglycerin to vinorelbine and cisplatin treatment can significantly improve the OS and time to progression in patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer . However , in phase III the addition of nitroglycerin to carboplatin-based did not show benefit in PFS , OS and health-related quality of life ( PMID : 26347110 ) . Therefore , the aim of this study was to assess , if the addition of transdermal NTG to standard WRBT treatment among stage IV NSCLC patients with BM , could have a significant impact in PFS and OS as primary end-point and disease control rate ( DCR ) and overall response rate ( ORR ) as secondary endpoints . METHODS Experimental design We conducted a phase II clinical trial with a parallel design study among patients treated at the Instituto Nacional de Cancerología from January 2014 to May 2017 . The Median follows up was 18 months . Patients with histologically confirmed NSCLC and documented BM defined as the presence of one or more intra-axial enhancing lesions on gadolinium-enhanced brain magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) were included . Candidate patients who underwent radiosurgery or surgical resection were excluded . Sample size . The sample size calculation was estimated for a two-sample proportion difference in ORR for NSCLC patients who received WBRT plus TN . Although in one of our previous studies we found a difference of 40 % in ORR among locally advanced NSCLC patients 30 , we prefer to be more conservative in our estimations taking into account our different study populations . Thus , our sample estimation assumptions were performed for a difference in ORR ( delta ) of 30 % between population ( p1= 25 % vs p2= 65 % ) with a study power was set at 0.80 and the two-sided type I error ( alpha ) was set as 0.05 . Therefore , the estimated sample number is 108 ( 54 per group ) . We also add a 5 % of extra patients , to prevent the possible loss of patients due to the progression of the disease . Endpoints . The primary outcome was overall response rate ( ORR ) ; Secondary endpoints were disease control rate ( DCR ) , intracranial progression-free survival ( ICPFS ) and overall survival ( OS ) . The radiographic response was assessed by two independent blinded radiologists according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) guideline version 1.1 by comparing the pre-and post-treatment images . Any in-field tumor progression or the appearance of new malignant lesions denoted progressive disease . ORR was defined as the sum of complete and partial response , whereas DCR was defined as the sum of ORR and stable disease . For PFS , time to event was defined and calculated from the date of randomization until radiographic disease progression , treatment discontinuation due to either unacceptable toxicity death by any cause . For OS , time-to-event was defined as time from randomization until death by any cause or loss to follow-up . Observations for patients who did not experience the event were censored at patient-specific last follow-up . Finally , treatment toxicity was evaluated with CTCAE criteria . Intervention assignment and informed consent Patients were randomized 1:1 and allocated to either the control arm who received whole-brain radiotherapy ( WBRT ) ( 30 Gy in 10 fractions , in 10 days of treatment ) or the experimental arm who received WBRT and the addition 36 mg of transdermal nitroglycerin ( TN ) with release of 10 mg in 24 hours , for 24 hours with a 12-hour rest interval ( to avoid saturation of receptors ) . All patients signed the informed consent letter , prior to any procedure . The project was approved by the local scientific and bioethics committee ( number ) . Further details can be found in clinicaltrials.gov ( NCT¿ ? ) . Patients received chemotherapy ( CT ) platinum-based or TKI according to mutation status . Response assessment BM was documented among all patients at NSCLC diagnosis and staging by either computed tomography ( CT ) of the head gadolinium-enhanced brain magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) at baseline . Then , all patients underwent an MRI prior to treatment and at the end of treatment ( median 15 days ) . The imaging studies were carried out in a Signa HDxt 1.5 T scanner ( GE Healthcare ) . They include conventional sequences in multiple planes , T1 , T2 , T2 Flair , Echo gradient , Diffusion , volumetric acquisition in axial plane T1 Spoiled Gradient recalled ( SPGR ) , without contrast and after this ( Gadolinium ) . Cerebral perfusion was evaluated by echo-planar sequence with the following parameters : multiphase ( 25 - 45 phases ) with an acquisition time of 1:10 , with a PSI of 5 and a flow rate of 5 ; with a volume of 15ml of gadolinium ( + ) 20ml of saline at a speed of 5ml/second .

On February 11,2020 , the World Health Organization officially named the disease caused by the new coronavirus `` COVID-19 '' . The Chinese Government takes stronger and harsher measures to control the progression of its outbreak . Meanwhile , five editions of `` Diagnosis and Treatment for Novel Coronavirus-Infected Pneumonia '' has been timely and continuously issued , which play extremely important roles in guiding the clinical management of COVID-19 nationwide in China . The symptoms of human infection with SARS-CoV-2 are generally fever , fatigue , dry cough and dyspnea . Noteworthy , a considerable percentage of COVID-19 cases have rapidly progressed to severe and critical type , among which acute lung injury ( ALI ) and acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) are the most common complications , resulting in a large number of pneumonia hospitalized patients requiring supplemental oxygen , mechanical ventilation , or even ECMO.Pulmonary edema is a detrimental feature as well as a key causal factor of ALI/ARDS . Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor ( VEGF ) is considered as the most potent vascular permeability inducers . Recent evidence has revealed higher VEGF levels in COVID-19 patients compared with healthy controls .

This is completed by taking oral contraceptives ( birth control ) continuously for three months . Prior to medication administration and at the end of treatment , eating behaviors will be measured and fMRI will be conducted in order to examine changes in activation in dopamine-reward pathways that occur with oral contraceptive administration . This will assess changes in brain activation that occur with the stabilization of ovarian hormones .","Eating disorders ( EDs ) affect 15 million women in the United States and have one of the highest mortality rates of any mental illness . Despite this , the underlying neurobiology remains poorly understood . EDs predominantly occur in women , and the frequency of certain symptoms change in a predictable pattern over the menstrual cycle ; specifically , symptom changes appear to be triggered by normal fluctuations in the ovarian hormones estradiol ( E2 ) and progesterone ( P4 ) . The objective of this study is to examine the impact of ovarian hormone stabilization , through the continuous administration of oral contraceptives ( OCs ) for 3-months , on brain activation in response to reward and eating behaviors in women who binge eat ( n=15 ) using functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) and behavioral testing . OCs work by suppressing ovulation , thereby reducing E2 and P4 changes that occur pre- and post- ovulation . Because the traditional 21/7 regimen of OC administration ( 21 active pills followed by 7 days of inactive pills ) allows follicles to begin to develop , this leads to the secretion of endogenous E2 , and then E2 withdrawal once active pills begin again . This does not result in consistent stabilization . Thus , this study will use OCs in a continuous manner , with no inactive pills . Participants will complete fMRI imaging and self-report questionnaires prior to OC administration and at the end of OC administration . The investigators will examine within-subject changes that occur in these measures with OC administration . The primary hypothesis is that continuous OC treatment will have a beneficial/stabilizing effect on outcomes of interest . Specifically , symptomatology may decrease from OC use . Results will ultimately provide the pilot data necessary for larger mechanistic trials .

It has been suggested that difficulty and failure of insertion are experienced more in nulliparous women ( adjusted odds ratio [ AOR ] 5.19 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 2.49 , 10.82 ) and in those with previous Caesarean delivery ( AOR 5.38 ; 95 % CI 2.58 , 11.22 ) , due to a narrower cervical os Fouda et al . found that women who had delivered only by Caesarean section experienced more pain with IUD insertion compared with women with previous vaginal delivery Many investigators have studied how to minimize insertion pain or failure . Few studies , however , have assessed any measure to decrease pain or difficulty during IUD insertion in women with previous Caesarean delivery ( and no prior vaginal delivery ) Pergialiotis et al . conducted a meta-analysis of clinical trials of analgesic options for IUD placement . Owing to the small number of trials , however , they concluded that further studies were needed before a conclusion could be reached Misoprostol is a synthetic analog of prostaglandin E1 originally approved for treatment and prevention of gastric ulcers induced by non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs . It can be administered sublingually , orally , vaginally , or rectally . Vaginal administration has been associated with the highest peak serum levels of misoprostol , and overall bioavailability is greatest for sublingual and vaginal administration . Misoprostol has well-known cervical ripening and uterotonic effects , naturally leading to its use as an adjunct in many gynecologic procedures . Its use has been well studied in the hysteroscopy literature . Multiple well-designed studies have validated the efficacy of different doses of misoprostol before hysteroscopy in reducing pain with dilation , reducing the number of failed dilations , and increasing cervical canal diameter before dilation Given these data , it is reasonable to hypothesize that pretreatment with misoprostol could aid in IUD insertion . As existing studies examining this question have asserted varied conclusions , through this study investigators will evaluate and compare the safety and efficacy of different doses of misoprostol prior to IUCD insertion among women with nulliparous cervix beside the rate of occurrence of adverse effects . This study aims to compare the efficacy and safety of different doses of vaginal misoprostol prior to IUCD insertion among women with nulliparous cervix `` those who never delivered vaginally '' .",2020-02-10,"July 13, 2020","Inclusion Criteria : Non-pregnant , Nulliparous cervix : no previous vaginal delivery or any attempt of vaginal delivery , Seeking for IUD insertion , Signing an informed consent to participate in the study , Exclusion Criteria : Pregnancy or signs of pregnancy , Signs of cervicitis , Any uterine abnormalities as congenital anomalies , endometrial lesions , adenomyosis , fibroids and intrauterine adhesions , Women with any kind of pelvic pain , Abnormal uterine bleeding , History of cervical surgery , • Vaginal delivery , Contraindication to misoprostol as allergy , Administration of any analgesics last 12h , Withdrawal of consent",180,1,18 Years,45 Years

If these measures fail , injections like corticosteroids and hyaluronate ( HA ) can be helpful for pain control.3 The aforementioned injections have unique mechanisms of action . Steroid injections work through reducing joint inflammation , while HA works by lubricating and cushioning the joint . There are several varieties of steroids and HA injections that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in knee OA . Among these variations are extended-release triamcinolone ( Zilretta ) , hylan GF-20 ( synvisc one ) , and hyaluronan ( monovisc ) . While each are FDA approved and commonly used in orthopedic and sports medicine clinics , they have never been directly compared in any study . Therefore , when selecting a treatment for a patient , it is largely based on provider preference , not clinical data .

"Rigshospitalet, Denmark",NCT04280055,Prophylactic Effects of Psilocybin on Chronic Cluster Headache,Gitte Moos Knudsen,1,0,Cluster Headache,Drug,Psilocybin,Treatment,,"The purpose of this study is to investigate the prophylactic effects of psilocybin in chronic cluster headache . Subjects will receive a low dose of psilocybin during 3 sessions spaced by one week . Subjects will maintain a headache diary prior to , during , and after the administrations in order to document headache frequency , intensity and duration . Subjects will undergo a fMRI scanning before the first and after the last psilocybin session .","Cluster headache ( CH ) is one of the most painful conditions known . CH affects 1 out 1000 and exists in two well-defined forms : episodic ( ECH ) and chronic ( CCH ) . Ten to fifteen percent of patients have CCH and have less than three months of pain-free time during a year . Medical treatment for CH is divided into acute abortive treatment for the single attack and a prophylactic treatment . The most commonly used prophylactic , verapamil , decreases attack frequency but does not induce remission and very high doses are needed . Although most therapeutic options ameliorate CH , they may be problematic due to major side effects , unsatisfactory treatment response or availability . Thus , novel treatment options are needed . According to several studies , patients that self-medicate with low doses of the serotonin 2A receptor ( 5-HT2AR ) agonist and psychedelic psilocybin report that this is effective as CH prophylaxis or even to induce remission . So far , no clinical trials to confirm this have been conducted , nor is there any objective measures of brain function in association with psilocybin intake in CH . There is , however , already some evidence from functional magnetic resonance ( fMRI ) imaging studies suggesting that CH patients have abnormal functional connectivity patterns involving the hypothalamus and distributed brain networks , but the implication of these abnormalities is unknown . The investigators are conducting a prospective pilot study , evaluating prophylactic effects of psilocybin in CCH using an open-label study design . They 're also going to investigate psilocybin 's active metabolite psilocin and brain function ( fMRI ) to identify possible brain mechanisms underlying CCH and treatment response , including the correlation of treatment response with psilocin levels and estimated 5-HT2AR occupancy and the extent to which brain network changes are affected by psilocybin and correlated with treatment response . Effects of psilocybin on headache frequency , duration and intensity will be assessed in a sample of 20 patients with CCH . Participants will fill out headache logs during the entire study period , in total 10 weeks . Before study inclusion , participants taking prophylactic medication will first go through a 2-week wash-out period to allow for elimination of the medicine . Inclusion is followed by a baseline observation period lasting four weeks , after which patients will first undergo a baseline rs fMRI scanning followed by the first dose of 0.14 mg/kg psilocybin p.o . Blood samples will be collected during the first psilocybin intervention to establish psilocin plasma concentrations , which will be used for estimating receptor occupancy . Participants will then undergo two additional psilocybin administrations spaced by one-week . The last psilocybin dose will be followed by 4 weeks of observation . One week after the last administration of psilocybin , participants will undergo a follow-up MRI scan .

University of Alaska Fairbanks,NCT04282603,Nutritional Strategies for Metabolic Health in Aging,University of Alaska Fairbanks,1,0,Sarcopenic Obesity,Combination Product,Weight Loss and Weight Maintenance,Prevention,Double,"Sarcopenic obesity in older individuals presents a clinical conundrum without an effective therapeutic strategy . This study will determine the impact of precision amino acid delivery as part of a meal replacement ( EMR ) during weight loss on the preservation of lean tissue and improvements in metabolic health and physical function in older obese adults . Following weight loss , the investigators will examine whether one serving/day of EMR will sustain the above stated benefits .","The health status of the aging population is negatively affected by sarcopenic obesity as described by the progressive loss of lean tissue and an increase in adipose tissue . This condition presents a clinical conundrum as it predisposes older obese individuals to a high risk for disability , morbidity and mortality . Insulin resistance , chronic inflammation , elevations in intrahepatic lipid and detrimental alterations in the gut microbiome are also evident . The application of caloric restriction-induced weight loss ( CRWL ) used to address these health risks in younger individuals may exacerbate muscle wasting and increase morbidity in older adults . Unfortunately , low fitness levels and poor compliance limit the mitigating influence of weight loss through exercise training on sarcopenic obesity . In order to address anabolic resistance or the decreased ability to maintain protein synthesis that contributes to sarcopenic obesity , the investigators have developed a complete meal replacement that contains a mechanism-targeted profile of essential amino acids ( 17 grams ) . This profile is designed to overcome anabolic resistance and maintain net protein balance even in the hypocaloric state . It is our overarching hypothesis that EMR will promote the retention of lean tissue mass , and improve metabolic and functional outcomes following 12 weeks of CRWL , and that those endpoints will be sustained over a 12 week maintenance period with the once per day ( q.d . ) consumption of EMR . The investigators will randomly assign older obese individuals to either EMR or an isocaloric serving of Bariatrics Advantage ( meal replacement that contains 27 grams of intact protein ) during these interventions . The investigators will execute these specific aims to test our hypotheses : SA1 . Establish the importance of EMR in the preservation of lean tissue mass during CRWL . Lean tissue mass and adipose tissue mass will be determined by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) and magnetic resonance imaging/spectroscopy ( MRI/MRS ) scans . MRI/MRS will be used to measure intrahepatic lipid , and the investigators will evaluate alterations in insulin sensitivity using the HOMA score . The investigators will measure potential changes in gut microbiota in collaboration with Dr. Duddleston at the University of Alaska Anchorage . SA2 . Determine the influence of EMR on physical function and increased daily activity during CRWL . Slow walking speed is a strong predictor of morbidity and mortality . The investigators chose the 6-minute walk test to represent the primary endpoint for this aim . The investigators will also determine alterations in gait speed , skeletal muscle power and strength and stair climbing ability , and changes in physical activity using Actigraph GT3X+ devices . SA3 . Identify whether EMR q.d . will sustain improvements in body composition , physical function and metabolic parameters over a 12 week , maintenance period following CRWL . Since the preservation of lean tissue mass is directly linked to optimal function and metabolic health , the investigators will measure the influence of EMR q.d . on the indices of metabolic health ( ie. , intrahepatic lipid , insulin sensitivity ) and physical function .",2020-02-05,"April 7, 2022",Inclusion Criteria : 60-80 years of age Body mass index of 30-40 kg/m2 Participants must be capable of understanding the consent process Participants must be capable of signing the consent form Participants must have access to transportation to the clinic site Exclusion Criteria : Creatinine > 1.6 Serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase > 2 times normal Resting blood pressure above 160/90 mmHg Use of Gemfibrozil Use of corticosteroids Previously diagnosed diabetes ( fasting blood glucose ≥ 126 mg/dl ) History of kidney or liver disease Heart disease as indicated by interventional procedures Recent history of alcoholism Physical or neurological disorder that would prevent them from completing the functional tests Lactose intolerance Active cancer within the last two years Chronic inflammatory conditions that preclude completion of functional tests,6,0,60 Years,80 Years

LID leads to reduced quality of life , increased caregiver burden and an increased risk of falls ( Rascol et al. , 2015 , Chapuis et al. , 2005 ) . GOCOVRI™ is an extended release capsule prescription medication shown to reduce LID in people with PD ( Pahwa et al. , 2017 , Pahwa et al. , 2018 ) . However , a number of studies have identified an increase in falls in those on the active medication study arm but not the placebo arm ( 13 % increase in active and 7 % in placebo ) ( Pahwa et al. , 2017 ) . In order to understand this increase in falls , comprehensive measurements of quantity of activity ( gait measured in the home environment ) and quality of activity ( comprehensive gait characteristics that may increase risk of falls ) need to be assessed in participants taking GOCOVRI™ . In addition , the evidence for the effect of GOCOVRI™ on gait and balance in PD is limited ( Smulders et al. , 2016 ) . This study is an open label study in which the following Aims will be studied : Aim I : Investigate the effect of GOCOVRI™ on activity levels in people with Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) and Levodopa induced dyskinesia ( LID ) Hypothesis I : We hypothesize that GOCOVRI™ will result in an increase of daily activity due to improvement in LID symptoms .

Ketamine ( a competitive NMDA receptor antagonist ) plays a role in thermoregulation at various levels and ketamine , has been shown to inhibit postoperative shivering in some reports and studies .","Spinal anaesthesia is a safe and popular anaesthetic technique for various surgeries . Around 40-60 % of the patients under spinal anaesthesia develop shivering.The main causes of shivering intra and postoperatively are temperature loss , decreased sympathetic tone and systemic release of pyrogens . Hypothermia during neuraxial anesthesia develops initially from core to peripheral redistribution of body heat . Redistribution of body heat during spinal or epidural anesthesia typically decreases core body temperature 0.5-1.0 degree Celsius . Shivering is characterised by involuntary oscillatory contractions of skeletal muscles . Once the body is exposed to cold , it is a physiological response for heat preservation after peripheral vasoconstriction . Postoperative shivering is defined as the fasciculation of the face , jaw or head or muscle hyperactivity , lasting longer than 15 seconds . It is a common and challenging aspect of anaesthesia and targeted temperature modulation because it leads to increase oxygen consumption and increases the risk of hypoxia . The most frequent complication in postoperative period is shivering which is reported to be between 20-70 % after general anaesthesia . The incidence reported in previous studies are 5-65 % after general anaesthesia and 30-33 % after epidural procedures . The overall shivering incidence in a recent meta-analysis was 34 % . The underlying pathology of shivering is not fully understood yet , therefore the definitive treatment and prevention has not been established till date . Due to its importance as postoperative complication and the lack of available data about aetiology and treatment , this narrative review of the published literature on this topic is essential . Various pharmacological agents being used for prophylaxis and treatment of post spinal shivering are Opioids like fentanyl , tramadol , pethidine , Anticholinergics like physostigmine , NMDA receptor antagonist like ketamine and the latest being alpha-2 antagonists like clonidine , dexmedetomidine . Recently , ketamine and dexmedetomidine have been used to prevent shivering during anaesthesia , with good results . Ketamine ( a competitive NMDA receptor antagonist ) plays a role in thermoregulation at various levels and ketamine , has been shown to inhibit postoperative shivering in some reports and studies . Dexmedetomidine , a centrally acting alpha 2-adrenergic agonist , has been used as a sedative agent and is known to reduce the shivering threshold . Dexmedetomidine also provided sedation which is sufficient to prevent the anxiety without any adverse effects . And until date , there are limited studies using dexmedetomidine in the treatment of postoperative shivering . A very limited data is available on this subject in our Pakistani population . Pethidine is drug of choice for the prevention and treatment of shivering . Due to the non-availability of Pethidine , doctors are looking for newer and better options . Considering this , a study is designed to compare between Dexmedetomidine and Ketamine , as they are easily available and very few studies are done till date comparing them , as ketamine is n't researched much as an anti-shivering agent as it is known for undesirable side effects like delirium and hallucinations and dexmedetomidine being a newer agent . Results of this study will help to select the better prophylactic option for prevention of shivering after spinal anaesthesia in our general population .",2022-10-22,"February 6, 2023",Inclusion Criteria : Patients aged 20-50 years .

Aristotle University Of Thessaloniki,NCT04391855,"Wound Infiltration With Tramadol, Dexmedetomidine, or Magnesium Plus Ropivacaine for Pain Relief After Spine Surgery",Aristotle University Of Thessaloniki,4,1,Analgesia,Drug,Tramadol with ropivacaine,Treatment,Triple,"The rationale for multimodal analgesia is to achieve additive or synergistic analgesic properties while decreasing the incidence of side effects by reducing the dose of each agent . Nociceptive stimuli are known to activate the release of the excitatory amino acid glutamate in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord . The resultant activation of NMDA receptors causes calcium entry into the cell and triggers central sensitization . This mechanism is involved in the perception of pain and mainly accounts for its persistence during the postoperative period . Peri-incisional injection of local anesthetics is an effective method for pain relief after many surgical procedures , as it can reduce postoperative analgesic consumption . Ropivacaine is a propyl analog of bupivacaine with a longer duration of action with a much safer cardiotoxicity profile than bupivacaine . Thus , a combination of local anesthetic with other analgesic factors , such as opioids , dexmedetomidine , clonidine , ketamine , magnesium sulfate , dexamethasone is suggested for a better analgesic outcome . Dexmedetomidine , a highly selective a2-adrenergic receptor agonist , has been the focus of interest for its broad spectrum ( sedative , analgesic , and anesthetic sparing ) properties , making it a useful and safe adjunct in many clinical applications . The intravenous , intramuscular , intrathecal , epidural , and perineural use of this agent enhances analgesic effects . Tramadol hydrochloride is a synthetic analog of codeine that acts on both opioid ( weak m receptor agonist ) and nonopioid receptors ( inhibits the reuptake of noradrenaline and serotonin as well as release stored serotonin from nerve endings ) which play a crucial role in pain inhibition pathway . It also blocks nerve conduction which imparts its local anesthetics like action on peripheral nerves . It was reported that NMDA antagonists could prolong the analgesic effect of bupivacaine to even a week , as well as inhibit hyperalgesia . Magnesium sulfate ( MGS ) is a non-competitive antagonist of N-methyl , D-aspartate ( NMDA ) receptors with an analgesic effect and is essential for the release of acetylcholine from the presynaptic terminals and , similar to calcium channel blockers ( CCB ) , can prevent the entry of calcium into the cell . Aim of the study is to evaluate and compare the postoperative analgesic efficacy of tramadol , dexmedetomidine , and magnesium when added to ropivacaine as an adjuvant for wound infiltration following spine surgery .","Each participant will receive standard monitoring ( ECG , SpO2 , capnography , SBP , oesophageal temperature ) and intravenous access will be established . A standard anesthesia protocol will be applied involving propofol 2mg/kg ( iv ) and remifentanil in TCI ( target-controlled infusion ) .

Currently approved smoking cessation medications act on nicotinic receptors , and additional work is needed to identify medications with alternate pharmacological targets . Based on evidence that the serotonin system plays a role in nicotine consumption and relapse , this study will examine whether a selective serotonin medication alters smoking-related behaviors and responses to cigarette smoking under controlled conditions , informing its potential utility for smoking cessation .","Tobacco use remains the foremost cause of preventable deaths in the U.S. and worldwide . Advancing new smoking cessation therapies , including those with novel pharmacological targets , is a critical public health priority . The serotonin ( 5-hydroxtytryptamine ; 5-HT ) system is broadly implicated in the regulation of reward- related behavior , including drug seeking , in part reflecting its modulatory role in dopamine ( DA ) function . Recent studies show that targeted manipulation of the serotonin 5-HT2C receptor alters drug-related behavior ; in particular , 5-HT2C receptor agonists are shown to reduce nicotine intake and reinstatement . Of the selective 5-HT2C receptor agonists , lorcaserin has the best near-term potential for repurposing as a smoking cessation therapy , having been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for weight management . Preclinical findings implicate several potential behavioral mechanisms by which 5-HT2C receptor agonists might reduce drug intake , including drug-specific processes ( e.g. , incentive salience of drug cues , self-administration , reinstatement ) and drug-nonspecific behaviors ( e.g. , reductions in impulsivity ) . To date , potential mechanisms of 5-HT2C receptor agonists have not been characterized in human studies . Given emerging interest in lorcaserin as a novel smoking cessation therapy , further studies are needed to evaluate its efficacy profile , including studies to evaluate candidate treatment mechanisms . This human laboratory investigation will examine the effects of lorcaserin vs. placebo on relapse-related outcomes using a double-blind , within-subjects , crossover design . Impulsivity subdomains will also be examined as candidate mechanisms for medication effects .

Centenario Hospital Miguel Hidalgo,NCT04391127,Hydroxychloroquine and Ivermectin for the Treatment of COVID-19 Infection,Centenario Hospital Miguel Hidalgo,3,1,COVID-19,Drug,Hydroxychloroquine,Treatment,Double,"Background : In December 2019 , patients with pneumonia secondary to a new subtype of Coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) were identified in China . In a few weeks the virus spread and cases started practically all over the world . In February 2020 , the WHO declared a pandemic . Severe symptoms have been found in patients mainly with comorbidities and over 50 years of age . At this time there is no proven therapeutic alternative . In vitro studies and observational experiences showed that antimalarial drugs ( Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine ) had antiviral activity and increased viral clearance . Ivermectin , on the other hand , has been shown in vitro to reduce viral replication and in an observational cohort , greater viral clearance with promising clinical results . So far there is no standard of treatment and clinical trials are needed to find effective treatment alternatives . Objective : To evaluate the safety and efficacy of treatment with hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin for serious COVID-19 infections in no critical hospitalized patients . Material and methods : Randomized controlled trial of patients diagnosed with respiratory infection by COVID-19 , who present criteria for hospitalization . Randomization will be performed to receive hydroxychloroquine at a dose of 400 mg every 12 hours for one day and then 200 mg every 12 hours , to complete a 5-day treatment schedule . Group 2 : Ivermectin 12 mg every 24 hours for one day ( less than 80 kg ) or Ivermectin 18 mg every 24 hours for one day ( greater than 80 kg ) + placebo until the fifth day . Group 3 : Placebo . Prior to randomization , the risk of cardiovascular complications determined by corrected QT interval , related to hydroxychloroquine intake will be assessed . If the patient is at high risk , the allocation will be to ivermectin only or to placebo in an independent randomization , if the risk is low , any of the three groups could be assigned . Outcomes : The primary outcome will be discharge from hospital for improvement . The safety outcomes will be requirement of mechanical intubation , septic shock or death . Viral clearance will also be evaluated by means of PCR , which will be taken on the 5th day after admission , day 14 and 21 .","Background In late December 2019 , the health authorities of the People 's Republic of China reported several cases of pneumonia of unknown origin in Wuhan City , Hubei Province , China . On December 31 , 2019 , the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention began etiological and epidemiological research on this disease . Three samples of bronchoalveolar lavage were taken from patients from the Jinyintan hospital in Wuhan and through various processes they came to identify a new coronavirus that they initially called on January 7 , 2020 as : 2019-nCoV . On January 2020 , the World Health Organization ( WHO ) made the first recommendations on the epidemiological surveillance of this new coronavirus . On January 22 , 2020 , the first session of the Emergencies Committee was convened by WHO in Geneva , Switzerland and on January 30 Public Health Emergency of International Importance ( ESPII ) was declared to the 2019 outbreak . On February 11 , the International Committee on Virus Taxonomy made up of experts , based on the biology , species and type of virus isolated , names this new coronavirus as SARS-CoV-2 and responds to `` Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 `` ( Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 for its acronym in English ) , the WHO proposes that same day to call the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 as COVID-19 . The first case reported in Latin America was in Brazil on February 26 and on the 28th of the same month , Mexico communicates its first confirmed case of the new coronavirus in a 35-year-old patient from a trip to Italy . Given the alarming levels of spread and severity of COVID-19 , at a press conference on March 11 , 2020 , WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus declares the SARS-CoV-2.5 outbreak as a pandemic . IVERMECTIN The SARS-CoV-2 viral genome was rapidly sequenced to allow for a diagnostic test , epidemiological follow-up , and the development of preventive and therapeutic strategies , however , to date there is no evidence from clinical trials for any therapy that improves the evolution of patients suspected or confirmed with COVID-19 . New potential candidates for the treatment of this disease have emerged . A preclinical study showed that ivermectin , an FDA-approved antiparasitic drug , reduces the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro . Ivermectin is a broad-spectrum antiparasitic that has shown antiviral activity against a broad group of viruses in recent years . It has been shown to inhibit the import of HIV viral integrase into the nucleus of human cells and also replication of the virus . It does something similar with other proteins of the SV40 virus and the dengue virus . It has also been shown to limit the infection of RNA viruses such as dengue , West Nile virus , Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus , and influenza virus . It has also been shown to be effective against DNA viruses such as pseudorabies of the mice . On the other hand , it has not been shown to be effective against the zika virus in mice , although this should be re-evaluated . Studies on the SARS-CoV-1 coronavirus have revealed that the alpha/beta1 importin of the virus plays a role in infection in relation to intracellular signals of the capsid protein , which may have an impact on the division of host cells . Studies in cultures of infected cells show that ivermectin has a potent antiviral effect against SARS-CoV-2 and opens up hopeful expectations for using this antiparasitic in the early treatment of COVID-19 which is likely to help reduce the viral load , prevent progression to severe phase and limit person-to-person transmission . Therefore , the development of clinical protocols comparing it with other antivirals with alternate mechanisms of action is important and should be established as soon as possible . In the study by Patel et al. , Ivermectin was evaluated in a cohort of patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation . In the ivermectin group , they were admitted to a dose of 150mcg/kg once they were intubated and observed a significant reduction in mortality , as well as significant reductions in the length of hospitalization and days in the intensive care unit . Hydroxychloroquine Antimalarial drugs such as chloroquine ( CQ ) and hydroxychloroquine ( HCQ ) have been used for more than a century . They have been used not only for malaria but also in rheumatic conditions due to their anti-inflammatory properties and good safety profile . That is why , in the midst of a pandemic , the question of the use of antimalarials in the treatment and prophylaxis of covid-19 has been raised . Kayaerts et al . demonstrated the inhibition of SARS-CoV by chloroquine in Vero E6 cells at different post-infection times . Vincent et al . demonstrated the dose-dependent inhibition effect of the virus on Vero E6 cells immediately after viral absorption and also 3 to 5 hours later . They also demonstrated that the cells pre-treated with CQ were refractory to the virus in addition to improving terminal glycosylation of the ACE2 receptor , decreasing the viral affinity for the receptor and also reducing the onset of infection . The above illustrates the possibility of using HCQ for prophylaxis or treatment against SARS-CoV . Due to the similarities of SARS-CoV-2 with the SARS virus , several studies have proposed the use of HCQ and CQ for management of the current pandemic . Wang et al . tested the in vitro effect of several antivirals approved by the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) of the United States of America . Remdesivir showed blocking of viral infection after virus entry with an Effective Concentration of 50 % ( EC50 ) of 0.77 μM and a cytotoxic concentration of 50 % ( CC50 ) greater than 100μM . Chloroquine had an EC50 = 1.13μM , and a CC50 greater than 100μM and an EC90 of 6.9μM . Chloroquine was effective at the viral entry and post-entry level , while remdesivir was only effective at the post-entry level . The above suggests a possible use of CQ as a prophylactic for SARS-CoV-2.19 infection . Yao et al . Also tested the effect of HCQ and CQ in vitro . They tested the pharmacological activity of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine using Vero cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 . Physiology-based pharmacokinetic models ( PBPK ) were implemented for both drugs separately integrating their in vitro data . Using PBPK models , hydroxychloroquine concentrations in the lung fluid were simulated under 5 different dosing regimens to explore the most effective regimen while considering the safety profile of the drug . In this study , it was found that HCQ ( EC50 = 0.72 μM ) is more potent than chloroquine ( EC50 = 5.47 μM ) in vitro . Based on the results of the PBPK models , a loading dose of 400 mg twice daily of orally administered hydroxychloroquine sulfate is recommended , followed by a maintenance dose of 200 mg twice daily for 4 days for infection by SARS-CoV-2 , since it reached three times the potency of CQ phosphate when administered 500 mg twice a day 5 days in advance . Gao et al . demonstrated the superiority of CQ over control treatment in more than 100 patients with respect to inhibition of exacerbation of pneumonia , improvement in lung imaging findings , promoting negative virus conversion and shortening the course of disease in more than 10 hospitals in China . Gautret et al . treated 20 patients with hydroxychloroquine and compared the results with 16 controls in France . They used PCR to measure viral load on days 3 , 4 , 5 , and 6 post-inclusion . The treatment group had a higher mean age , but no gender difference was made between the two groups . Asymptomatic patients and patients with upper and lower respiratory tract infections were treated . They concluded that HCQ was effective in reducing viral load . The results on day 3 indicated that 50 % of the patients treated with HCQ had a reduction in viral load ( p = 0.005 ) , on day 4 it showed a 60 % reduction ( p = 0.04 ) on day 5 , a 65 % reduction ( p= 0.006 ) and on day 6 , 70 % of the patients showed a reduction in the viral load ( p= 0.001 ) . Furthermore , they described the synergistic effect of azithromycin when used in conjunction with HCQ to decrease viral load . Dual treatment showed a 100 % decrease in viral load ( p < 0.001 ) for day 6 , while hydroxychloroquine alone showed a 70 % decrease . In the recently published recommendations of the American Society for Infectious Diseases ( IDSA ) on April 11 , 2020 , it is established that in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 , the use of HCQ / CQ should only be given in the context of a clinical trial . The best evidence currently available has failed to demonstrate or exclude a beneficial effect of HCQ on the clinical progression of COVID-19 , as inferred by radiological findings , or on viral clearance by means of PCR tests , although a somewhat higher proportion in the HCQ group experienced clinical improvement ( RR : 1.47 ; 95 % CI 1.02 - 2.11 , p=0.04 ) . However , the certainty in the evidence was rated as very low mainly due to small sample sizes , co-interventions , and risk of bias due to methodological limitations . Furthermore , the selected results should be considered indirect , since significant patient outcomes ( eg , mortality , rate of progression to ARDS , and need for mechanical ventilation ) were not available . Studies evaluating the addition of azithromycin ( AZ ) to HCQ provided indirect comparisons of failure of virological clearance with historical controls . The observed risk of mortality among patients who received HCQ + AZ during the hospitalization was 3.4 % ( 6/175 patients ) . However , an estimated mortality rate in an untreated cohort was not provided in the manuscript . Compared to the lack of viral clearance in historical controls ( 100 % virological failure ) , 12 symptomatic patients were compared on day 5 or 6 of a separate hospital in France . Patients who received HCQ + AZ treatment experienced numerically fewer cases of virologic failure ( 43 % combined virologic failure ; 29/71 patients ) . There is very low certainty in this comparison of treatment effect , mainly due to very high risk selection bias , making any claims of effectiveness highly uncertain . Furthermore , relying on intermediate outcomes , such as viral clearance to determine important outcomes for the patient ( including a reduction in the development of pneumonia , hospital or ICU admission , or the need for intubation ) adds another layer of imprecision . Finally , Barbosa et al conducted a comparative study of hospitalized adults with viral pneumonia secondary to SARS-CoV-2 during the last two weeks of March 2020 . A group receiving HCQ and support measures against another group that only received support measures . The primary endpoints were the effect of hydroxychloroquine use on the need to increase respiratory support , change in lymphocyte count , and change in neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio . In this study , of 63 included patients , 32 were assigned to the HCQ arm . The administration of HCQ was associated with the need to increase the degree of ventilatory support compared to those who did not receive HCQ for 5 days ( p = 0.013 ) . The change in total lymphocytes in the HCQ group was not different from that in the group that only received support measures . These authors concluded that the use of HCQ tends to worsen the neutrophil / lymphocyte ratio compared to the group that only received supportive measures , in addition to the fact that the use of HCQ was found to increase the risk that the patient required ventilatory management with intubation . Definition of the problem Due to the high rate of spread of COVID-19 infection , associated with a high rate of hospitalization due to respiratory failure , empirical treatment of active agents in vitro has become a common practice . Hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin have demonstrated viral inhibition in vitro and observational experiences have proposed them as potentially safe alternatives with clinical efficacy . The proposed treatments have an adequate margin of safety , in addition to the fact that we have extensive clinical experience because they were previously used in humans to treat malaria , rheumatologic diseases , or parasitosis . Due to this , in conjunction with the urgent need to seek therapeutic alternatives , controlled studies are required without assuming efficacy . Justification COVID-19 infection has collapsed health systems in industrialized countries due to the large number of patients requiring respiratory assistance . There is no standard treatment for the management of this infection and the focus has been on the already known life support and management of Adult Respiratory Failure Syndrome in critically ill patients . The treatments used empirically have an adequate safety profile due to the experience in other clinical settings . The use of these empirical alternatives should be based on clinical trials since efficacy and safety should not be assumed in the group of patients with COVID-19 . The Miguel Hidalgo Centennial Hospital has been assigned as a hospitalization center for COVID-19 patients in Aguascalientes Mexico . Hypothesis Treatment with hydroxychloroquine or Ivermectin will be superior to placebo , with a shorter hospital stay and a lower rate of complications ( intubation , septic shock , or death ) .",2020-05-12,"November 6, 2020",Inclusion Criteria : RT-qPCR SARS-CoV-2 positivity or chest computed Tomography with suspected COVID-19 pneumonia Hospitalization by medical emergency staff criteria Exclusion Criteria : Other confirmed viral active and acute infection,108,0,16 Years,90 Years
The Mind Research Network,NCT04396847,Laboratory Screening of Lorcaserin for Alcohol Use Disorder,The Mind Research Network,2,0,Alcohol Use Disorder,Drug,Lorcaserin Oral Tablet,Basic Science,Quadruple,"Heavy-drinking smokers , including those with alcohol use disorder ( AUD ) , are at increased risk for numerous negative health outcomes relative to those who use alcohol or cigarettes only . Although heavy-drinking smokers are recognized as an important subgroup for clinical and public health interventions , there are presently no approved medications for the joint indication of alcohol reduction and smoking cessation . Based on evidence that the serotonin system plays a role in alcohol and nicotine consumption and relapse , this study aims to examine whether a serotonin medication alters alcohol and nicotine responses in smokers with AUD , informing its potential utility as a candidate therapy for this clinical subgroup .","Pharmacotherapy development remains a critical objective for reducing health and societal burdens associated with alcohol use disorder ( AUD ) . Developing targeted treatments for specific AUD subgroups is a key objective . Among those with AUD , cigarette smokers comprise a sizable and critical subgroup with disproportionally high long-term health risks , making it a key priority to advance therapies for concurrent AUD and cigarette smoking . The serotonin ( 5-hydroxtytryptamine ; 5-HT ) system is broadly implicated in addictive behaviors , in part reflecting the role of 5-HT in modulating dopamine function . Preclinical studies of 5-HT receptor drugs have shown that targeted modulation of the 5-HT2C receptor ( implicated in 5-HT-related inhibition of DA function ) alters the consumption and reinstatement of addictive drugs , including alcohol and nicotine . Of the selective 5-HT2C receptor agonists , lorcaserin has superior near-term potential for repurposing as an AUD therapy , having been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for weight management . Human laboratory medication trials offer a time- and cost-effective option for validating preclinical findings prior to larger randomized controlled trials , and for testing candidate treatment mechanisms . This Phase II human laboratory screening trial will evaluate lorcaserin as a novel candidate therapy for smokers with AUD . Effects of lorcaserin vs. placebo will be evaluated in a double-blind , within-subjects , crossover study with human laboratory endpoints . This study will provide early human data on the effects of a 5-HT2C receptor agonist in relation to alcohol-related outcomes , informing its potential for further evaluation as a candidate treatment for AUD .",2020-02-03,"August 16, 2022","Inclusion Criteria : Age 21-65 Meeting DSM-5 criteria for current ( past year ) AUD , as well as current at-risk drinking ( i.e. , ≥14/21 drinks per week for women/men , on average ) , with at least four episodes of 4+/5+ drinks in the past 30 days Daily smoker , defined as reporting smoking 1+ cigarettes per day , on average , over the past 12 months Willingness to take study pills and complete study procedures Willingness to complete lab sessions involving alcohol administration Exclusion Criteria : Recent ( 30 day ) illicit drug use ( with the exception of cannabis ) based on self-report or toxicology screen Meeting DSM-5 criteria for a past-year substance use disorder other than alcohol use disorder , tobacco use disorder , or mild cannabis use disorder Significant alcohol withdrawal , based on a Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol-revised ( CIWA-Ar ) score of 8+ at baseline medical visit , or any reported history of severe withdrawal symptoms ( e.g. , seizures ) Past 30-day use of nicotine replacement Past 30-day use of SSRIs , other psychiatric medications , or weight control medications Lifetime diagnosis of severe mental illness ( e.g. , psychotic or bipolar I disorder ) Significant medical or neurological illness based on medical staff ( i.e. , physician or nurse practitioner ) evaluation including severe hepatic impairment or cirrhosis , insulin dependent diabetes Current alcohol or smoking cessation treatment or efforts to cut down on drinking/smoking Medications contraindicated for use with lorcaserin or which have a significant interaction with lorcaserin Body mass index ( BMI ) under normal range ( < 18kg/m2 ) History of significant cardiovascular conditions including history of arrhythmias or heart block , heart failure , valvular heart disease , heat attack , stroke , unstable angina Abnormal electrocardiogram ( ECG ) results Currently nursing , pregnant , or anticipating pregnancy history of suicide attempt or recent suicidal ideation ( i.e. , Suicidal thoughts ( intent or plan ) in the last month ) Plans to travel outside of the local area during the study period , or inability to commit to entire duration of study",5,0,21 Years,65 Years

We sought to evaluate the effect and safety of ruxolitinib ( RUX ) add-on in the treatment of patients with SR-GVHD .,"Nowadays , second-line treatment for SR-GVHD differs between centers and depends on the physician 's experience . The agents commonly used as second and further lines of therapy include anti-thymocyte globulin , mycophenolate mofetil , calcineurin inhibitor , or extracorporeal photopheresis . However , the response varied . This study highlighted that corticosteroid ( CS ) is not a panacea for treating GVHD , and some patients with remission still experience further relapse . Additionally , the identification of multiple infections adds complexity . Hope was supposed to come in 2019 after the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) approved RUX for the therapy of SR-GVHD in adult and pediatric patients > 12 years . RUX add-on should be withheld as the risks outweigh the benefits , especially for patients who developed scleroderma and bronchiolitis obliterans . RUX can be added on as needed for the treatment of GVHD , especially in patients receiving DLI as relapse therapy with the conversion from mixed chimerism to complete chimerism . Despite some studies showing the efficacy of RUX across affected organs , some other data bring the opposite results . Thus we conducted this study to reinforce the efficacy of RUX as an add-on therapy for SR-GVHD .",2022-11-23,"December 15, 2022",Inclusion Criteria : Patients diagnosed with hematologic disorder Exclusion Criteria : Those who are not applicable of receiving Ruxolitinib as immunodeficiency-modulation therapy Those who are actively encountering acute infectious illness,6,0,3 Months,30 Years

Johns Hopkins University,NCT04498468,Safety and Efficacy of Dexamethasone Ophthalmic Insert (Dextenza®) in the Management of Clinically Significant Dry Eye,Johns Hopkins University,4,0,Dry Eye,Drug,"Sustained Release Dexamethasone, 0.4 mg",Treatment,Double,To determine efficacy and safety profile of dexamethasone 0.4mg lacrimal insert in dry eye related ocular surface inflammation .,"Previous studies showed that dexamethasone and loteprednol topical drops have led to favorable results . However , the requirement of frequent instillation of drops by the patients is problematic causing discomfort and blurring of vision and requires remembering and dexterity for instillation , poor compliance is not uncommon . In addition Investigators believe that instillation of drops disturbs the homeostasis of the natural tear film due to physical and chemical trauma due to large drop volume ( 50 microliters ) hammering on the eye surface ( which can only hold 7 to 10 microliters ) . Particularly washing away of the mucin layer that holds all the `` good ingredients '' in the tears is harmful to the ocular surface . Therefore , `` dropless '' treatment of dry eye is desirable . Dextenza® ( dexamethasone ophthalmic insert , Ocular Therapeutix Inc. , Bedford , MA ) is a corticosteroid intracanalicular insert approved by US-FDA in November 2018 for the treatment of post-surgical ocular inflammation and pain . It is inserted into the lower lacrimal punctum and into the canaliculus . A single insert releases a 0.4 mg dose of dexamethasone for up to 30 days following insertion . Dextenza® is resorbable and does not require removal . Investigators hypothesize that Dextenza® could mimic short-term topical steroid use in a tapering manner in patients with clinically significant dry eye and show efficacy in improving its symptoms and signs , as was previously shown with other steroid preparations . If proven , the use of Dextenza® may shift paradigms in the management of the clinically significant ocular surface disease . To test this hypothesis , investigators propose to study the effects of Dextenza® in the treatment of clinically significant dry eye .",2020-07-28,"June 8, 2023","Inclusion Criteria : A patient 's study eye must meet the following criteria to be eligible for inclusion in the study : Male or Female Age 18-100 Capacity to give informed consent Ability to follow study direction and complete all study visits A previous or current diagnosis of dry eye by an eye care specialist , whereas treatment is requiring the use of a topical steroid Able to have a lacrimal plug placement into both lower puncta .

Herlev Hospital,NCT04492553,Gonadal Dysfunction in Male Long-term Survivors of Malignant Lymphoma; Vitality,Lars Møller Pedersen,2,1,Hypogonadism,Drug,AndroGel,Treatment,,"This study is a prospective non-randomised open label multicenter phase two study in male long-term survivors of malignant lymphoma including Hodgkin Lymphoma ( HL ) and Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma ( DLBCL ) . The study aims to assess whether low levels of testosterone in the blood of patients cured for aggressive lymphoma , can be effectively treated with Testosterone gel , and if treatment with testosterone can improve their general quality of life . The investigators hypothesize that patients will develop sexual dysfunction and poor quality of life when suffering from untreated reduced level of testosterone . Cancer treatment is increasingly effective and the overall survival higher , which makes issues like sexuality and long-term quality of life more and more important to address in cured cancer patients . Patient sexuality and quality of life is measured by three questionnaires , and serum testosterone level , during one year of treatment with Testogel . The intention is to show that future follow-up visits should include focus on sexuality and serum testosterone , so relevant patients can be identified and treated for their hormonedeficiency without delay . The expected follow-up program include questionnaires and blood samples , which are easily implemented and without great cost .","Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and Hodgkin Lymphoma are two aggressive lymphomas often treated with doxorubicin containing chemotherapy . Doxorubicin is an anthracycline and is known to be toxic to both Leydig Cells of the testes and hormone-producing cells of the hypothalamus . Therefore , patients treated with this drug are at risk of developing hypogonadism . Standard follow-up programs do not include analysis of hormone levels or treatment of hypogonadism . With this study the aim is to investigate the effect and toxicity of treatment with exogenous testosterone in male long-term survivors of malignant lymphoma , to clarify whether it is relevant to include serum testosterone and potentially testosterone replacement therapy in standard follow-up programs . Our Hypothesis : Hypothesis 1 : A significant proportion of long-term male survivors of HL and DLBCL have impaired quality of life ( QoL ) due to sexual dysfunction . Hypothesis 2 : A significant proportion of long-term male survivors of HL and DLBCL have reduced levels of testosterone . Hypothesis 3 : A significant relationship between QoL , sexual dysfunction and testosterone levels exists . Hypothesis 4 : Substitution with testosterone in carefully selected subgroups will improve sexual function and QoL . Hypothesis 5 : Treatment with testosterone in this setting is safe with acceptable toxicity . To assess efficacy and safety of treatment with testosterone replacement therapy on hypogonadism in lymphoma patients , blood tests and questionnaires are completed throughout one year of treatment .

Universidade Federal de Alfenas,NCT04495374,Oral Pregabalin as Preemptive Analgesia in Abdominal Hysterectomy,Universidade Federal de Alfenas,4,0,"Pain, Postoperative",Drug,Pregabalin 300mg,Prevention,Triple,"Postoperative pain affects 80 % of surgical patients and is one of the main negative symptoms resulting from surgery . It impairs the recovery of patient since it is related to chronic pain , nausea and vomiting and longer hospital stay , generating higher cost to the health system . Thus , the use of new methods to control postoperative pain is recommended and multimodal analgesia , an opioid-sparing strategies , has been widely used by several researchers . Studies show that gabapentins have beneficial effects on postoperative pain control when used as pre-anesthetic medication , also showing a reduction in opioid consumption , with few adverse effects . Among gynecological surgeries , abdominal hysterectomy is one of the procedures that generates the highest degree of acute postoperative pain . Thus , the aim of the present study is to investigate the effect of oral pregabalin ( 300 mg ) two hours before abdominal hysterectomy procedures on postoperative pain . This study is a randomized , double-blind , placebo controlled clinical trial . Patients submitted to abdominal hysterectomy for benign pathologies will be selected and divided into two groups : the placebo controlled group ( P0 ) and the pregabalin 300 mg group ( P1 ) . Group P0 will receive a placebo tablet one hour before the procedure , while group P1 will receive a 300 mg tablet of pregabalin identical to the placebo tablet . The reduction of postoperative pain and the best quality of patient recovery will be evaluated using the Visual Analogue Pain Scale ( VAS ) and the McGill Pain Questionnaire . Also , it will be evaluated the consumption of opioids as a rescue analgesic medication and the presence of adverse effects such as nausea and vomiting .","The sample population of this study is 102 female patients ( 50 already included in the study ) , who have undergone abdominal hysterectomy surgery for benign conditions , with or without joint oophorectomy / salpingectomy . The patients received spinal anesthesia , at hospital `` Santa Casa de Alfenas '' - Minas Gerais / Brazil ( `` Casa de Caridade Nossa Senhora do Perpétuo Socorro '' ) . All surgeries were performed by the same team of surgeons . All patients were evaluated and followed from the preoperative period , up to 24 hours postoperatively , passing through the intraoperative period . During all stages , patients were assisted by a properly trained multi-professional team , consisting of a doctor , nurse and nursing technician . For the patient to be included in the study , she must have understood and agreed with the informed consent form that was explained in detail to all possible candidates in the preoperative period . This is a double blind randomized study . The patients were randomly allocated to 02 groups , in which Group 1 received medication A ( designated in the study as medication 1 ) , whereas Group 2 received medication B ( designated in the study as medication 2 ) . Study participants and researchers were blinded as to the use of drug / placebo to avoid measurement bias . To carry out the blinding process , an external researcher was assigned to randomize the groups and prepare the pills in opaque and closed envelopes characterized only by a control identification ( A or B ) , which is known only to this researcher . Patients in both groups received identical sealed envelopes , 02h before the start of the anesthetic procedure , only identified as medication A or B , which contained two pills in each envelope . A second researcher is responsible for collecting data and monitoring the patient from the intraoperative period up to 24 hours after discharge from the post-anesthetic recovery room ( PARR ) . In the operating room , venoclysis was performed with jelco No . 18 or No . 20 , and an infusion of 08 ml.kg-1 of crystalloid solution ( lactated ringer ) . The patients were properly monitored with pulse oximetry , cardioscope , and non-invasive blood pressure monitor . After monitoring , patients were premedicated with intravenous ( IV ) midazolam at a dosage of 0.03 mg.kg1 . To perform spinal anesthesia , the patients were seated on the surgical stretcher by the nursing team . Asepsis and antisepsis were performed at the puncture site with alcoholic chlorhexidine solution . After placement of sterile drapes , local anesthesia was performed with 2.0 % lidocaine without vasoconstrictor . The first attempt at subarachnoid puncture was performed , using the median technique , between the intervertebral levels L3-L4 or L4-L5 or L5-S1 , with a 25 gauge Quincke needle for subarachnoid anesthesia . If there was a technical difficulty in the puncture , the paramedian puncture technique was chosen . The confirmation of the correct puncture was based on the aspiration of cerebrospinal fluid . Anesthesia was performed with the local anesthetic 0.5 % bupivacaine at a dosage of 0.3 mg.kg-1 , injected from a 5 ml disposable syringe . After anesthesia , the patients were placed in the supine position , and the correct level of anesthesia was proven with thermal sensitivity tests using cotton soaked with alcoholic solution . After the anesthesia reached the sensory level of the T4 thoracic vertebra , the surgical team was allowed to start the procedure . Prior to the beginning of the surgical incision , a delayed bladder probe was performed in all patients according to the surgeon 's indication . Hemodynamic changes in blood pressure were controlled with the use of vasoactive medications such as ephedrine or metaraminol . For prophylaxis of postoperative nausea and vomiting ( PONV ) ondansetron was administered at a dosage of 4 mg intravenously ( IV ) 30 minutes before the end of surgery . Tenoxicam was prescribed for all patients at a dosage of 20 mg IV at regular intervals every 12 hours for the purpose of anti-inflammatory and analgesic action . For analgesic relief , dipyrone IV was also prescribed at a dosage of 50 mg.kg-1 at regular intervals every 6 hours . During the surgery , and also at the end of the surgery , the patients were evaluated for the degree of sedation using the Ramsay sedation scale as a basis . At the end of the surgery , the patients were referred to the post-anaesthesia care unit , where they were monitored again , and went through the pain assessment process using the visual analog scale ( VAS ) in relation to pain at rest and `` movement '' ( the patient was asked to perform the forced cough movement ) , through a direct question with scale demonstration . Pains characterized as mild ( 0 - 2 VAS ) received no medication other than those already prescribed ; pain characterized as moderate ( 3 - 7 EVA ) received IV morphine at a dosage of 0.025 mg.kg-1 ; and severe pain ( 8 - 10 VAS ) received IV morphine at a dose of 0.05 mg.kg-1 every 01 h until analgesic control . To consider themselves able to be discharged from the post-anaesthesia care unit for clinical follow-up in wards , patients should reach a score ≥ 9 on the modified Aldrete Scale and have VAS pain scores ≤ 2 . In the infirmary , patients were tested at regular intervals for pain intensity , by of a team of nurses trained and qualified to do so . The patients had pain classified as moderate ( VAS ≥ 2 < 8 ) or severe ( VAS ≥ 8 ) , receiving drugs with morphine IV in the dose of 1 mg and 2 mg respectively , according to the medical prescription . 24 h after discharge from the post-anaesthesia care unit , in the ward , all the patient was assessed by the same examiner who performed an assessment at the post-anaesthesia care unit , who stratified the patient again from the EVA and assessed using the McGill questionnaire . During the entire hospitalization period , the use of central nervous system ( CNS ) depressant drugs ( example : ketamine , droperidol , promethazine ) and / or analgesic drugs that do not contain any study protocol was avoided . If some patients were medicated with these drugs , they were excluded from the study . The data related to surgery ( pre , trans and postoperative ) were collected for statistical analysis , according to Annex II , in which a total duration of surgery in minutes ; the total intravenous medication infused ; the values of mean arterial pressure and heart rate in the pre , intra and postoperative period ; a presence or not , as well as a quantity , of PONV in the post-anaesthesia care unit and after 24h ; presence or not of dizziness as a possible side effect ; among others .

"University of Mississippi, Oxford",NCT04490239,Intranasal Heparin Tolerability Study,Joshua Sharp,0,1,Covid19,Drug,Intranasal heparin sodium (porcine),Prevention,,"The investigators are investigating the tolerability of Heparin Sodium ( porcine ) administered topically via a nasal spray . This agent is being investigated as a potential prophylactic treatment to prevent infection by SARS ( severe acute respiratory syndrome ) -CoV-2 , the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 . Heparin Sodium ( porcine ) is an FDA-approved anticoagulant drug administered by injection . Recent work from multiple groups have found that heparin can prevent the infection of cells by SARS-CoV-2 , indicating a possible use as a topical anti-viral . Numerous studies in both rodent models and humans have shown that heparin administered via a pulmonary or intranasal route enters the blood stream in negligible amounts , suggesting intranasal administration of heparin should be safe even at very large doses . Data from mouse models indicate that repeated daily nasal administration of heparin had no adverse effects in mice over a two week period ( including weight loss , nose bleeds , loss of sense of smell , nasal discharge , or decreased blood clotting time ) . However , no data of repeated nasal administration of heparin in humans is available . The investigators will test nasal administration of FDA-approved heparin sodium ( porcine ) , originally formulated for injection . The formulations the investigators will be testing consist of heparin , sodium chloride , and 1 % benzyl alcohol as a preservative bottled in a nasal sprayer dispensing 0.1 mL ( millilitres ) per spray . The investigation is planned in two phases . A single-dose phase will test the acute tolerability of the drug . In this phase , subjects will be administered 0.1 mL of Heparin Sodium in each nostril formulated at one of two doses : Day 1 will test a formulation of 5000 U ( units ) /mL , and Day 2 will test a formulation of 10000 U ( units ) /mL . After each dose , subjects will be tested for systemic exposure via blood aPTT tests and platelet count , as well as for local topical toxicity via examination for epistaxis and anosmia , along with any other adverse events . In the chronic phase , subjects will be administered the highest dose that was tolerated in the acute phase daily for fourteen days . Subjects will be tested for aPTT and platelet count , as well as epistaxis , anosmia and any other adverse events .","Study Objectives This exploratory clinical trial is designed to assess tolerability of increasing doses of intranasally administered heparin sodium in saline solution . Baseline values for aPTT and complete blood count will be obtained from six subjects . Heparin will be administered in increasing concentrations using one 0.1 mL ( millilitre ) spray per nostril ( 0.2 ml total ) on a daily basis . Major signs of toxicity will be clinically relevant changes in aPTT time , clinically relevant decrease in platelet count , signs of anosmia 30 minutes after administration , or epistaxis . Dosing will start at 1000 units of heparin administered ( 500 units in each nostril ) and then escalated to 2000 units . Should a clinically relevant aPTT prolongation ( > 50 % increase from subject baseline ) or decrease in platelet count ( below clinical lab normal limit ) be observed at either dose , the study will be halted and a series of lower doses evaluated . Study Overview Description of Design of Study This study is a single center , prospective , Phase 0 exploratory tolerability trial . A total of 6 healthy subjects ( 3 M and 3 F ) will be enrolled into the study . This study will evaluate the acute and multi-day ( 14 days ) tolerability of intranasally administered heparin . Test Article Investigational Product The study will assess the single and multi-dose tolerability of intranasal administration of an aliquot of an FDA-approved heparin sodium injection ( 5,000 USP units/mL or 10,000 USP units/mL ) to deliver 1000U ( units ) or 2000U of heparin sodium . Doses will be prepared and administered as follows : 1000 U = ( 2 x 0.1 mL ( milliliter ) of 5000U ( units ) /mL or one spray of 500 U in each nostril ) 2000 U = ( 2 x 0.1 mL of 10000U/mL or one spray of 1000 U in each nostril ) The test article will be administered by transferring ( 4 mL ) of sterile heparin sodium injection ( 5,000 USP units/mL or 10,000 USP units/mL ) at ambient room temperature into intranasal spray bottles , one for each individual subject . The test article will be administered within 4 weeks of preparation , and the remainder discarded after study completion . Supplier The test article ( Heparin Sodium USP ) will be obtained from appropriate commercial sources . Safety Assessments Safety assessments will be completed as part of this single and multi-dose , pharmacokinetic study . Safety will be assessed prior to test article administration and at 24 post dose , in the acute phase . For safety assessments during the chronic phase , safety assessments will be assessed prior to test article administration , day 14 and day 15-post study . Test subject will be called every three ( 3 ) days for updates and subjective reports ( adverse events ) , during 14 day , daily dose phase . Subject safety will be assessed by monitoring adverse events , clinical laboratory tests , vital signs , and physical examinations . Laboratory parameters will be evaluated during screening and daily , to include the following : Complete Blood Count ( WBC , RBC ( red blood cell count ) , Hematocrit , Hemoglobin , MCV ( mean corpuscular volume ) , Platelet Count ) PT ( prothrombin time ) /INR ( international normalized ratio ) Baseline and post study Serum/Urine hCG ( human chorionic gonadotropin ) baseline and predose Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time ( aPTT ) Clinical Adverse Events Clinical Adverse Events will be monitored throughout the study . However , such events are not anticipated during this trial due to the low systemic exposure of the test article being administered . However , local side effects of intranasal heparin , such as epistaxis or nasal congestion may result . For any abnormal lab values , test subjects will be evaluated for any sign and symptoms , and labs will be redrawn , until stabilized or returned to baseline . Subjects will be referred to the primary physician for any continued care required .",2020-07-20,"April 27, 2021","Inclusion Criteria : Normal , healthy adults aged 18 to 65 years Exclusion Criteria : Allergy to Heparin Currently taking any prescription blood thinners or anti-coagulants , or currently taking any intranasal medication Known history of anemia , thrombocytopenia , or other blood disorder Autoimmune disorders Known history of Neurologic/Psychiatric disorders Report of an active infection Subject is pregnant or breast-feeding , or is expecting to conceive during the study .

Bozyaka Training and Research Hospital,NCT04756050,Comparison of Different Approaches for Supraclavicular Block and Their Effects on Diaphragm Muscle Function,Bozyaka Training and Research Hospital,4,1,Phrenic Nerve Paralysis,Drug,Bupivacaine HCl 0.5% Injectable Solution,Treatment,Double,"Brachial plexus blocks used for anesthesia in upper extremity operations can be performed with interscalene , axillary , supraclavicular and infraclavicular approaches . Plexus blockage can be performed under the guidance of needle nerve stimulation , artery palpation or ultrasonography ( USG ) . Nowadays , the simultaneous use of USG during the block allows the protection of structures such as nerves , pleura and vessels , and allows practitioners to see the needle and the spread of local anesthetic during the injection . Although supraclavicular block seems to be advantageous because the brachial plexus is more compact and superficial in this region , it has a disadvantage of being close to the pleura . ( Increased risk of pneumothorax ) With the use of USG , this risk has decreased and the supraclavicular block has become an alternative to infraclavicular block , which is widely used in upper extremity surgery . Due to the compact structure of the brachial plexus trunk at the first rib level , the application of the block is easier and the block formation is faster due to the peripheral spread of the local anesthetic . With the spread of local anesthetic to C3-C5 nerve roots in the brachial plexus , paralysis can be seen in the ipsilateral phrenic nerve up to 67 % . Patients who will be operated on , especially in patients with respiratory distress , may experience respiratory distress due to the dysfunction of that side diaphragm muscle . With the help of ultrasound , the inspiratory and end-expiratory thickness of the diaphragm is measured with the Diaphragm Thickness Index ( DTI ) , which is a new and effective method used as a mechanical ventilator weaning index in intensive care units . With this method , we can examine the effect of phrenic nerve block on diaphragm muscle due to local anesthesia in the acute period . DTI is calculated as a percentage from the following formula : ( Max thickness at the end of inspiration - Max thickness at the end of the expiration ) / Max thickness at the end of the expiration . By comparing 3 different approaches used in supraclavicular block , we aimed to investigate the most appropriate block approach in terms of effectiveness , speed , complication rate , effects on diaphragm and 6 months effects .","In this prospective randomized double-blind study , patients will be divided into 3 groups using a computer program . Standard monitoring ( ECG , pulse oximetry , noninvasive blood pressure ) will be applied to the patients who will then be taken to the block application room . After the peripheral vascular access is established on the hand that will not be operated on , premedication will be provided with 2 mg iv midazolam . The blocks will be performed by an experienced anesthesiologist with the USG guidance . Block evaluation and measurements will be made by a different experienced anesthesiologist . After the antisepsis of the area to be blocked , a 22G 50 mm stimulator needle will be used for the block . Intermittent negative aspiration will be performed during all procedures to detect possible vascular puncture . The local anesthetic mixture we routinely use in our clinic will be used . 20 ml of bupivacaine ( Buvicaine HCl % 0.5 ) and prilocaine ( Priloc HCl % 2 ) 1:1 mixture will be prepared in a way that there will be 5mcg adrenaline per ml . ( 9ml bupivacaine , 9ml prilocaine and 2ml saline with 50 mcg adrenaline per ml ) The ultrasound probe will be placed on the clavicle , the supraclavicular block will be applied in the coronal oblique plane using the in-plane technique . 3 different approaches of supraclavicular block will be compared . Approaches share the same probe position and needle entry point but differ in where the local anesthetic is given . Group 1 : Local anesthetic mixture will be given to the corner pocket - where the artery and the first rib intersect in the sonoanatomical image . Group 2 : 10 ml of the local anesthetic mixture will be given to the described corner pack and the remaining 10 ml into the largest nerve cluster ( Intracluster injection ) . Group 3 : Local anesthetic mixture will be administered by multi injection method between the nerve groups seen in the sonoanatomical image . The diaphragm thickening fraction and evaluations will be made by another experienced anesthesiologist , double-blindness will be achieved by being blind to the patient 's group . Effects of phrenic nerve block on diaphraghma muscle will be evaluated by diaphraghma thickining fraction.All patients will be evaluated with USG in a head-up position facing the side to be operated before and 30 minutes after the block is performed.The probe will be placed perpendicular to the chest wall , in the eighth or ninth intercostal space , between the anterior axillary and midaxillary lines , 0.5 to 2 cm below the costophrenic sinus . The diaphragm will be viewed as a structure with three distinct layers , including two parallel echoic lines ( Diaphragmatic pleura and peritoneum ) and a hypoechoic line between them ( Diaphragm muscle ) . The patient will be instructed to breathe up to total lung capacity ( TLC ) and then exhale to residual volume ( RV ) . Several diaphragm images will be taken , at least three at the point of maximum thickening in TLC and at least three at minimum thickness in RV . On each B-mode image , diaphragm thickness will be measured from the middle of the pleural line to the middle of the peritoneal line . Then DTI will be calculated as a percentage from the following formula : ( Max thickness at the end of inspiration - Max thickness at the end of the expiration ) / Max thickness at the end of the expiration . With this formula , we can determine the involvement of phrenic nerve by looking at the rate of diaphragm thickening before and after supraclavicular block in different groups . As a first line rescue anesthesia , patients will receive sedoanalgesia with remifentanil infusion . Laryngeal mask and general anesthesia will be commenced if needed . The postoperative analgesic regimen will routinely contain 1000 mg IV acetaminophen ( 3x1 ) and , if necessary , 1 mg opioid ( Tramadol ) per kg will be given .",2021-02-08,"June 11, 2023","Inclusion Criteria : Patients who are scheduled scheduled for hand , wrist , forearm , arm surgery Patients who has informed consent for study Patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status Classification ( ASA ) I , II and III Exclusion Criteria : Patient 's refusal to participate Patients under 18 years of age Patients with known local anesthetic allergy Patients with Body mass index > 35 Patients diagnosed sepsis and bacteriemia , Skin infection at the injection site , History of coagulopathy or anticoagulant therapy Patients with uncontrolled diabetes , Uncoordinated patients , Psychological and emotional lability , Patients with anatomical disorders at application points Pregnant patients",90,0,18 Years,65 Years

Rift Valley fever is a disease caused by RVFV and it is transmitted to humans through a mosquito bite or contact with virus-contaminated tissues and fluids . Although initially restricted to Africa , the virus can be transmitted by several different mosquito species that are more widely distributed than the virus itself , leading to concerns of disease spread as has occurred in the Arabian Peninsula and Madagascar . In humans , RVFV infection usually presents as a sudden febrile illness , but severe manifestations including bleeding disorders and neurological complications may also occur . RVFV is considered a global health threat with significant potential for international spread and use in bioterrorism . Vaccines against RVFV are available for livestock , however no licensed vaccines or specific treatments are currently available for humans . The study will enable assessment of the safety of the new vaccine called ChAdOx1 RVF and the extent of immune response in healthy volunteers . Healthy adult volunteers will receive a single dose of a new candidate vaccine at different doses . The objective of this first-in-human study is to find the optimal dose of the vaccine , balancing immune responses and profile of adverse events . Healthy volunteers aged 18-50 will be recruited in Oxford and vaccinated at the Centre for Clinical Vaccinology and Tropical Medicine and will be followed for a period of 3 months .

Subjects in Part A will be admitted to the study site on Day -1 and dosed on Day 1 after fasting ( nothing to eat or drink , except water ) for at least 10 hours . Water is not allowed 1 hour prior to and 1 hour after dosing . Water can be consumed ad libitum at other times . Subjects will remain fasted on Day 1 for 4 hours after dosing . Subjects will be discharged from the study site on Day 4 , after the scheduled procedures and review of the Day 4 safety data by the investigator ( or designee ) . Subjects will come back for an end of study ( EOS ) visit on Day 8 ( ± 1 day ) . A sentinel cohort of 2 subjects will be used to mitigate the risk of unexpected adverse events ( AEs ) not predicted by preclinical pharmacology and toxicology studies for each dosing cohort , starting with Cohort 1 ( the initial dose cohort ) . The sentinel subjects will be dosed in a blinded fashion ( 1 active , 1 placebo ) and monitored for at least 1 day before the remaining 6 subjects in that cohort are dosed . Initiation of dosing of the remaining 6 subjects will depend on an initial safety review by the investigator indicating that administration of the study treatment was safe and well tolerated in the sentinel subjects . Dose escalation will occur only after the real time PK , safety , and tolerability data ( including reported AEs , physical examinations , vital signs , electrocardiograms ( ECGs ) , and clinical laboratory results up to 48 hours after dosing ) of the preceding dose cohort for at least 6 subjects are assessed and the study treatment is deemed safe and well tolerated by the safety review committee ( SRC ) . As new safety and/or PK data become available , the anticipated dose escalation scheme may change following a review of the data by the SRC . Preliminary PK data from subjects in this study will help guide dose escalation to higher doses . Dose escalation in Cohorts 4 and 5 will only occur after the PK data from at least the first 2 cohorts have been assessed and deemed sufficient to model exposures for Cohorts 4 and 5 . Food Effect Assessment ( Cohort 4 in Part A only ) : Subjects in Cohort 4 of Part A will participate in a food effect arm . The actual dose level for food effect cohort is subject to change and will be confirmed by the SRC after review of data from at least the first 2 cohorts of the SAD . Following the standard SAD dosing on Day 1 and at least 3 days of follow up/washout ( or 5 times the estimated half-life of INS018_055 based on the observed data , whichever is longer ) ( Period 1 ) , enrolled subjects will enter Period 2 and be re administered the same dose of INS018_055 or matching placebo ( the same treatment that they received on Day 1 of Period 1 ) after completing a standard high-fat meal . Subjects will fast ( nothing to eat and drink , except water ) for at least 10 hours overnight and receive a standard high-fat breakfast 30 minutes prior to dosing . The high-fat breakfast will be consumed within approximately 30 minutes . Subjects will remain at the study site on Day 4 of Period 2 until the scheduled procedures and review of the Day 4 safety data by the investigator ( or designee ) are completed . The washout period of at least 3 days ( or 5 times the estimated half life of INS018_055 based on the observed data , whichever is longer ) may be extended based on available PK data from previous cohorts . The Day -1 procedures will not be repeated for Period 2 . Physical examinations , vital sign measurements , 12-lead ECGs , and clinical laboratory evaluations will be performed at selected time points throughout the study . Subjects will also be closely monitored for AEs throughout the study . Blood samples for PK will be collected up to 72 hours after study treatment administration on Day 1 for all cohorts . For biomarkers ( CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells ) , blood samples will be collected at check-in ( Day -1 ) , Day 2 , and Day 4 after administration of INS018_055 . Fecal occult blood tests will be done with all stools passed at screening , check-in ( Day -1 ) , and during the 72 hour observation period . Subjects will be discharged on Day 4 . Part B ( Multiple Ascending Dose [ MAD ] ) : Eight healthy subjects will be assigned to each of up to 5 sequential once daily ( QD ) or twice daily ( BID ) dose cohorts and will be randomly assigned within each dose cohort to receive INS018_055 or a matched placebo for 10 days in a ratio of 3:1 ( 6 active , 2 placebo ) , for a total of up to approximately 40 subjects . Subjects in Part B will begin dosing , after safety and tolerability data ( including reported AEs , physical examination , clinical laboratory results , 12-lead ECGs , and vital signs ) from at least the first 3 cohorts ( Cohorts 1 to 3 ) in Part A are assessed and the study treatment is deemed safe and well tolerated by the SRC . Additionally , sufficient PK data from at least the first 3 cohorts of Part A must be obtained to model exposures in Part B . The dosing schedule , either QD or BID , will be decided by the SRC after review of the PK , safety , and tolerability data from the first 3 cohorts of Part A . The initial MAD cohorts will begin dosing with the remaining SAD cohorts . The top dose explored in Part B will not exceed the maximum dose explored in Part A . Subsequent dose escalations in Part B will not occur until the safety ( including AEs , physical examination , clinical laboratory results , vital signs , and 12-lead ECGs ) and tolerability data up to and including Day 14 of the preceding MAD dose cohort for at least 6 subjects are assessed and the study treatment is deemed safe by the SRC . As new safety or PK data become available , the dose escalation scheme may change . Subjects may not receive a subsequent higher dose and may instead be administered a lower dose or may repeat the same daily dose with a different administration schema , eg , BID instead of QD dosing , to achieve lower maximum observed plasma concentration ( Cmax ) values , particularly if the safety findings are believed to be linked to the Cmax values . The highest dose in the MAD ( either QD or BID ) will be dosed in a staggered way if accrued PK data from previous cohorts predict potential exposures above the no observed adverse effect level , with 2 subjects starting dosing at least 7 days before the remaining 6 subjects ; initiation of dosing of the remaining 6 subjects will depend on an initial safety review by the investigator indicating that administration of the study treatment was safe and well tolerated in the sentinel subjects . Each subject in Part B will be admitted to the study site on Day -1 and will begin daily dosing on Day 1 . Study treatment is to be administered daily at approximately the same time in the morning . For BID dosing , the second dose of study treatment will be administered approximately 12 hours after the morning dose of study treatment . Prior to the morning dosing on Days 1 and 10 for Cohorts 6 to 10 , subjects will fast ( nothing to eat and drink , except water ) for at least 10 hours overnight and remain fasted for 4 hours after study treatment administration . Water is not allowed 1 hour prior to and 1 hour after dosing . Water can be consumed ad libitum at other times . Water is not restricted for the evening doses when study treatment is being dosed BID . On Days 1 and 10 , lunch will be provided approximately 4 hours after the morning dose , dinner will be provided approximately 10 hours after the morning dose , and a snack will be provided approximately 13 hours after the morning dose . On Days 2 to 9 for Cohorts 6 to 10 , breakfast will be provided approximately 60 minutes after study treatment administration . Standardized meals will be provided to the subjects throughout the study . Lunch will be provided approximately 4 hours after the morning dose , dinner will be provided approximately 10 hours after the morning dose , and a snack will be provided approximately 13 hours after the morning dose . Physical examinations , vital sign measurements , 12-lead ECGs , and clinical laboratory evaluations ( including liver function test results ) will be performed at selected time points throughout the dosing interval . Subjects will be closely monitored for AEs throughout the study . Blood samples for PK analyses will be collected up to 72 hours after study treatment administration on Day 10 . Urine samples for PK analysis will be collected before dosing ( Day 1 as a single void collected within 0 to 24 hours ) and over the following intervals after dosing : 0 to 4 , 4 to 8 , 8 to 12 , and 12 to 24 hours on Day 1 and 0 to 4 , 4 to 8 , 8 to 12 , 12 to 24 , and 24 to 48 hours on Day 10 for both QD and BID cohorts . For biomarkers ( CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells ) , blood samples will be collected at selected time points for QD and BID dosing cohorts . Fecal occult blood tests will be done with all stool samples at screening , check-in ( Day 1 ) , and throughout Part B on site observation periods , ie , up to Day 14 . Subjects will be discharged from the study site on Day 14 , after the scheduled procedures and review of the safety data by the investigator ( or designee ) .

Ain Shams University,NCT05002101,Daily Zinc Supplement Effect on Prevention of Diarrhea and Acute Respiratory Infections in Children Less Than Five Years,Ain Shams University,4,1,Zinc Deficiency,Dietary Supplement,zinc,Prevention,Single,Zinc deficiency in children is a major problem which leads to compromised immunity and accordingly repeated infections . This study aims to investigate the effect of supplementing zinc to decrease the incidence of diarrhea and respiratory illness in children between 6 months and 5 years in Paediatric Outpatient Clinic in Ain Shams University Hospital .,"Zinc is a trace element that plays essential roles in protein and lipid metabolism , cell growth and differentiation , and the immune system ; either cellular or humoral immunity . There is no specialized zinc storage system in the body , accordingly , a daily intake of zinc is required to maintain a steady state . Zinc deficiency can cause compromised immune function , accordingly this can lead to infections and growth defects among young children According to literature review search , there is lack of studies on the preventive effect of zinc supplementation on Egyptian children less than five years old ; the age group which is known by the suboptimal nutritional status and the high prevalence of infection . Accordingly , the present study is aiming to evaluate the impact of 4 months of daily zinc supplementation on the incidence of diarrhea and respiratory illness and to detect the frequency of daily dietary intake of zinc-rich food children between 6 months and 5 years in Paediatric Outpatient Clinic in Ain Shams University Hospital . Objectives : To evaluate the impact of 4 months of daily zinc supplementation on : - the incidence and the severity of diarrheal morbidity . - the incidence of acute respiratory infection . To measure the level of serum zinc in children between 6 months and 5 years attending Paediatric Outpatient Clinic in Ain Shams University Hospital . To compare between children who had initially low serum zinc level with those with normal level as regard the reduction in the incidence of diarrhea and respiratory illness . To measure the frequency of daily dietary intake of zinc-rich food in children between 6 months and 5 years attending Paediatric Outpatient Clinic in Ain Shams University Hospital . Methodology : • Study type : a single blinded , randomized controlled trial . • Study setting : Paediatric Outpatient Clinic in Ain Shams University Hospital . Sampling method : A convenience sample of children between 6 months and 5 years was recruited from the Paediatric Outpatient Clinic in Ain Shams University Hospital . • Study population : Eligible children aged between 6 months and 5 years attending Paediatric Outpatient Clinic in Ain Shams University Hospital was included . Randomization and allocation : Random assignment of the sampled children to either the study group receiving zinc or the control group receiving placebo was done . The study was single-blinded , where the children 's mothers wo n't know either their children are enrolled in the study group or the control group . • Study tool : - Baseline questionnaire : Structured interview questionnaire was used at the first meeting with the mother to collect baseline data . The questionnaire includes baseline characteristics , such as child age , child sex , family size , child rank , child feeding practices ( breastfeeding ) , maternal literacy , vaccination history and birth weight . Also , the baseline questionnaire assessed the occurrence and duration of diarrhea and respiratory illness in the past month before the start of zinc supplementation . Questions are adopted from the Demographic and Health Survey ( DHS ) questionnaire ( Ministry of Health and Population/Egypt , 2015 ) . - Questionnaire for Zinc-Rich Food Intake Pattern : The questionnaire , a dietary history recall instrument , was used to elicit and capture information on frequency of daily dietary intake over previous 1 month of two categories of zinc-rich foods namely : Foods of animal origin devoid of zinc antinutritional factor ( liver , fish , milk , eggs ) Food of vegetable origin including those known to contain a zinc antinutritional factor ( cereals , beans ) - Serum zinc : A blood sample was collected from all included children at the beginning of the study to estimate the baseline serum zinc level . Venous blood samples ( about 4 milliliters ) were collected in heparinised tubes and transported to the laboratory for centrifugation and serum zinc estimation using atomic absorption spectrophotometer graphites . - Intervention : The children were randomized to receive daily zinc sulphate or placebo . The elemental zinc dose was 3 mg/ day to children whose weight is less than 10 kg and 7 mg/ day to children whose weight is 10 kg or more . This dose is more than the recommended dietary allowance for supplementation so as to allow for possible impairment in absorption of ingested zinc among children as a result of consumption of a predominantly phytate-rich cereal-based diet , bacterial overgrowth , and protozoal or parasitic infestations . At the same time the dose wo n't exceed the upper tolerable level for zinc ( World Health Organization and Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations , 2005 ) . One bottle that contained 150 mL was kept in the child 's home and replaced monthly . The placebo was non-nutritious and vitamin-free , designed to be identical to the zinc syrup in colour , odour , and taste . - Follow up : Each month , during the child visit to the Paediatric Outpatient Clinic , or through a telephone call , the mother was asked certain questions regarding the occurrence and duration of diarrhea and respiratory illness in the past month . Questions are adopted from the Demographic and Health Survey ( DHS ) questionnaire ( Ministry of Health and Population/Egypt , 2015 ) . - Pre- and posttreatment anthropometric parameters ( weight and length\ height measurements ) were recorded . Nutritional status was assessed by measuring weight and height using standard methods and calculating weight for-age and weight-for-height Z scores . Weight was measured to nearest 100 gm using an electronic scale .",2021-07-26,"August 4, 2021","Inclusion Criteria : Apparently healthy child with good general health Exclusion Criteria : Children with severe malnutrition requiring hospital admission , Cases of chronic and metabolic diseases as diabetic children Children suffering from any type of cancer or any other debilitating disease .",140,0,6 Months,5 Years

Combination treatment with JNJ-73763989 and NA has the potential to specifically decrease HBV viral antigen levels and inhibit viral replication . Since HBsAg is immune suppressive , the direct reduction of HBsAg levels by JNJ-73763989 is anticipated to contribute to the restoration of the immune response that is impaired in chronic HBV infection . Pegylated interferon ( PegIFN ) is an approved drug for the treatment of chronic HBV infection and after a finite treatment duration of 48 weeks results in slightly increased HBsAg seroclearance rates . The primary hypothesis of this study is that at least one of the combination regimens of JNJ-73763989+NA+PegIFN-alpha-2a is more efficacious than NA treatment alone ( standard of care ) , as measured by the primary efficacy endpoint .

"University of California, Berkeley",NCT05003063,Effects of Acetylcholine and Attention on Visual Spatial Representations in the Brain,"University of California, Berkeley",0,1,Visual Perception,Drug,Donepzil,Basic Science,Triple,"This study in , healthy human subjects using fMRI and MRS ( magnetic resonance spectroscopy ) characterizes , how attention and acetylcholine affect visual perception and the brain 's representation of the visual environment . Levels of acetylcholine in the cerebral cortex will be enhanced by administration of donepezil , an inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase . Half the subjects will receive donepezil and other half will receive placebo .","The long-term objective of this project is to characterize how attention and acetylcholine affect visual perception and the brain 's representation of the visual environment . Acetylcholine is a naturally occurring neurotransmitter , and acetylcholine release is elevated during periods of sustained attention . Both acetylcholine and attention enhance aspects of visual perception , but the underlying brain mechanisms are poorly understood . The proposed work will address these questions in healthy human subjects by using functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) and MRS ( magnetic resonance spectroscopy ) to measure the brain 's responses to visual stimuli . Our previous studies have shown that increasing levels of acetylcholine in the brain enhances the spatial resolution of the brain 's representation of the visual environment . The proposed research will document exactly which brain areas mediate this effect of acetylcholine and will also characterize the effects of attention on these measures of spatial resolution in the brain . The technique of fMRI ( functional magnetic resonance imaging ) and MRS ( magnetic resonance spectroscopy ) , both subtypes of MRI , will be employed to measure brain activity in different brain areas while subjects are performing a visual attention task . Levels of acetylcholine in the cerebral cortex will be enhanced by administration of donepezil , an inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase , the enzyme that metabolizes acetylcholine . Moreover , the technique of MRS will be employed to locally quantify the levels of acetylcholine in different brain areas . In addition to providing information about how attention is represented in the brain and how it affects processing of visual stimuli , the present experiments should also shed light on the function of the cholinergic projection from the basal forebrain to the cerebral cortex . As this projection is thought to be selectively impaired in Alzheimer 's disease , knowledge concerning its function in the healthy brain may be useful for understanding the etiology of this disease and for development of appropriate therapies . BEHAVIORAL PHARMACOLOGY : Sessions : Subjects will perform 6 behavioral sessions over several days outside the scanner , split into two experimental parts . There will be 2 baseline sessions without donepezil/placebo and 4 testing sessions with donepezil/placebo . Each behavioral ( outside the scanner ) session will last 1-2 hours . During the testing session , subjects will be given one pill of ( 2.5 or 5 or 10mg ) donepezil or placebo per session . The choice of the pill will be determined by the flip of a coin . The drug dosage ( 2.5 or 5 or 10mg ) will be determined so as to ensure that there are equal number of participants per drug dosage . The pill ( drug or placebo ) not selected for the first experimental session in a pair will be administered during the second experimental session . Task : A typical cognitive task will involve presentation of images or words on a computer monitor or sounds through headphones . The subjects are asked to respond to certain stimuli by pressing a button . All stimuli are presented at a comfortable level . The cognitive task performed during the behavioral is an object-tracking/target detection paradigm in which subjects indicate whether a target is presented or not on each experimental trial . The target , when it is presented , is a visual stimulus at the threshold of detectability . On some trials , subjects will receive cues indicating target location and/or features that will facilitate target detection . Subjects will be asked to report by pressing a button on a response box . Subjects will receive breaks every 5-10 minutes or more frequently if they desire . MRI AND PHARMACOLOGY : Sessions : For experiments involving MRI , there will be a total of 6 sessions across several days , split into two experimental parts . There will be two baseline MRI session without donepezil/placebo and 4 testing sessions ( two donepezil , two placebo ) . Subjects will be given one pill of ( 2.5 or 5 or 10mg ) donepezil or placebo per session . The choice of the pill will be determined by the flip of a coin . The pill not selected for the first experimental part will be administered during the second experimental part . For MRI experiments , the experimenter will escort the subject to the Brain Imaging Center in Li Ka Shing about 2.5 hours after pill administration , and fMRI measurements will begin approximately 3 hours after pill administration . The MRI sessions typically take 1-2.5 hours , and the subject is given frequent breaks . The subject may stop the experiment at any time . Subjects undergoing MRI scanning will be asked to lie on their back in the MRI scanner . Before being scanned , a MRI imaging coil made of plastic will be placed around the subject 's head . The subject will not come into contact with the coil during the experiment . Foam pads will be placed around the subject 's head to limit head movement during the study .

Methods : This mixed methods study evaluates the effectiveness of a combined vaccination-screening strategy to reduce HPV prevalence/incidence and occurrence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasms grade 2+ and/or anal intraepithelial neoplasms grade 2+ , using Kaplan-Meier . The time-to-event method will evaluate time from positive results for specific anogenital HPV to incidence of anogenital lesions containing that HPV type . Conclusions : This study will generate scientific evidence on effectiveness of a combined vaccination-screening strategy to reduce the burden of HPV-associated neoplasms within vulnerable populations in Mexico .","Men who have sex with men ( MSM ) , people with HIV , homeless people ( many of whom participate in survival sex ) , female sex workers , transgender women and rape victims are at high risk for human papillomavirus ( HPV ) infection and consequently developing cancers associated with chronic HPV infection including cervical , vaginal , vulvar , and anal cancers in women , cancer of the penis , anal cancer , in men , and cancer of the oropharynx , tongue , and tonsils in both men and women , In part , this is related to increased life expectancy among people with HIV ( given greater anti-retroviral treatment coverage ) . Some countries have implemented HPV vaccination policies that include men . This is based on promotion of protection against an increased risk of HPV infection , universal increase in coverage and a gender equity perspective . Since population-level introduction of HPV vaccines , there has been a dramatic impact in areas with over 60 % vaccination coverage . Decreases of approximately 90 % have been reported for HPV-6/11/16/18 infections , over 90 % for new cases of genital warts , 45 % for low-grade cytological abnormalities , and 85 % for anogenital high-grade histological lesions . The HPV FASTER concept combines HPV vaccination with HPV screening . It is based on the HPV vaccine 's high efficacy and the high sensitivity of high-risk HPV testing for primary detection of anogenital cancer precursor lesions ( as documented by our research group in more than 200,000 Mexican women ) . This strategy is effective because HPV vaccination among women and men over a wide age range offers protection to those not currently infected and protects against subsequent re-infections16 . Thus , a combined HPV vaccination and screening strategy will potentially : 1 ) mitigate the demand for timely screening tests by expanding screening intervals ; 2 ) improve the cost-benefit balance of secondary prevention programs ; and 3 ) provide greater protection and quality of life to more people by reducing the burden of diseases attributable to HPV . This intervention can save many lives over the next 30 years and be more cost-effective than traditional approaches . Recently , the US vaccination advisory group recommended HPV vaccination among sexually abused children , recognizing their increased risk of HPV infection , . The US Centers for Disease Control recommends administering the HPV vaccine to subjects with immunosuppressive conditions , HIV infection , and men who have sex with men . HPV vaccination in HIV-positive people is safe and reduces the incidence of HPV-associated cancers , including anal cancer , which is increasing in these populations , . Moreover , some research has shown that vaccination against HPV in populations with HIV is cost-effective . HPV serotypes 16 and 18 , found in the HPV bivalent and tetravalent vaccines , have an estimated relative contribution to invasive cervical cancer of at least 70 % in Latin America . These vaccines are highly effective , provide high levels of immunogenicity , have acceptable security profiles and have been incorporated into public vaccination policies with 3-dose schedules over a 6-month period based on pharmaceutical industry recommendations . Alternative schedules of population vaccinations have been implemented in spite of the conflict of interest with the pharmaceutical industry . The first of these schedules was conducted in Quebec , Canada where the extended 0-6-60 month schedule was promoted for girls under 16 years . Later , in Mexico , a similar vaccination program recommended by a group of experts coordinated by the National Institute of Public Health was initiated . Mexico was a pioneer in adopting a 2-dose alternative vaccination schedule in April 2014 . Currently , there is evidence that alternative schedules are not inferior to the traditional schedule in terms of immunogenicity . In 2012 , Switzerland adopted a 2-dose vaccination schedule against HPV in girls under 15 years old under assuming age was the main mediator of the protection induced by the vaccine and not the number of doses . This assumption would explain why the vaccine was the main inducer of IgG responses , plasma cells , and memory B cell formation and why 2 doses administered with a 6-month interval provided similar protection during the initial years of vaccination . In April 2014 , the Council officially pronounced the adoption of a vaccination schedule against HPV with only 2 doses with a periodicity of 0 and 6 months . The justification for this resolution , in which Mexico was a pioneer and was subsequently officially recommended by the WHO as a vaccination policy at a global level , was that the immunological responses of girls aged 9 to 11 years after two doses of HPV vaccine were similar to or greater than those obtained after three doses in women aged 16 to 26 years . The benefits of this decision are logistical and economic ; increasing coverage and providing greater flexibility in the application of the second dose . Moreover , the savings generated from not administering a third dose are considerable . Alternative schedules with two doses and schedules with a third dose at 60 months in girls 9-11 years of age can offer a ) improvements in the immune response in the medium- and long-term , because there is evidence that a new exposure to HPV increases the expression of antibodies logarithmically , and b ) advantages in its administration , since it is easier to organize these schedules within the framework of schools and consequently provides a better opportunity for equity in obtaining greater coverage and adherence to complete schedules in the captive population before leaving compulsory schooling . However , although the recommendation is plausible from an immunological perspective , there is no evidence from clinical trials of efficacy to support this determination for ethical reasons . Currently , a paradigm shift is perceived toward the application of a single dose of vaccine against HPV . Research groups at a global level are evaluating the hypothesis that men and women who receive one versus two doses do not have a higher prevalence of HPV and that consequently the effect of the intervention is equivalent . In this regard , demonstration studies are being conducted in population universes to evaluate the effect of a single dose of HPV vaccine . The strategy is to evaluate the effect of administering 1 versus 2 doses in a specific community using a randomized intervention allocation strategy . In the 2-dose intervention group , the most biologically and logistically efficient approach is to administer the second intervention between 6 and 12 months after the first intervention . The outcome to be evaluated in men who have sex with men is the presence of HPV DNA in the anal canal , which is obtained and determined in the basal measurement during the administration of the first dose . This type of intervention is feasible in Mexico due to its invaluable tradition of innovation in public policies for the prevention and control of anogenital cancer and its implementation of large demonstration studies . Currently , it can be affirmed that with the current evidence , vaccination of all groups at risk of anogenital cancer with a single dose will be the preamble to the attenuation of the impact of persistent HPV infections and their consequent lesions . Methods Hypotheses The application of a combined HPV vaccination scheme and screening through the identification of high-risk HPV subtypes will reduce the prevalence of HPV infection in the oral and anogenital cavities in the different study groups , at 12 months post-vaccination . Consequently , the occurrence of grade 2 or higher anal intraepithelial neoplasia ( AIN 2+ ) lesions in men and high-grade or higher cervical intraepithelial neoplasia ( CIN 2+ ) lesions in women will decrease . Alternative vaccination schedules of one versus two doses of prophylactic vaccines against HPV are equivalent in terms of effectiveness . Urine and self-collected vaginal , anal canal , and oral cavity samples constitute an alternative epidemiological surveillance approach for monitoring the impact of a combined strategy HPV vaccination and screening for high-risk HPV subtypes in vulnerable populations . Objectives Primary objective • To evaluate the effectiveness of a combined strategy of HPV vaccination and screening for high-risk HPV subtypes to reduce the occurrence of HPV in the anogenital region and oral cavity in five highly vulnerable groups in Mexico City , Mexico : men who have sex with men , female sex workers , transgender women , subjects living in street situations , and people who have suffered rape . Secondary objectives To evaluate the effectiveness of alternative HPV vaccination schedules . To evaluate the usefulness of the collection of self-collected vaginal , anal , and urine samples as alternatives for monitoring the impact of a combined strategy of HPV vaccination and screening based on the detection of high-risk HPV subtypes . To assess the barriers to and facilitators of the introduction of a combined HPV vaccination and primary screening strategy with tests for high-risk HPV subtypes in the study groups . Study population and procedures The sample sizes for the five cohorts are : 6,000 MSM , 500 transgender women , 400 homeless men and women , 400 sexual assault victims , 2500 female sex workers . This study is a mixed methods study combining public health interventions offering primary and secondary prevention of HPV to populations highly vulnerable to these health problems with evaluation of the interventions in a 12-month follow-up . In addition the study includes qualitative interviews that will undergo systematic analysis on the perceptions , meanings , and individual experiences of the intervention , within the study groups . A central element of the present project is a parallel study of five sentinel cohorts of the adult population ≥ 14 years and ≤ 45 years of age that is operationally coordinated by the Condesa and Iztapalapa Specialized Clinics , which belong to the health services of Mexico City and the Program of Care for rape victims . This program is coordinated by the Specialized Clinics in collaboration with the Mexico City Attorney General of Justice.especially the Victims Care Center , which is a program of the Center for Therapy in Support of Victims of Sex Crimes . The investigators attempt to include at least 80 % of the population of each interest group in the epidemiological component of the project . Study subjects will be recruited ( 2018-2019 ) during their routine care within any program or service the participant attend within the Condesa and Iztapalapa Specialized Clinics ; in addition , posters will be placed within the clinics inviting potential study subjects to participate and civil society organizations which collaborate with the clinics will be visited regularly to invite persons involved in their activities to participate in the study . For the qualitative intervention component , individuals from the five vulnerable groups will be selected for voluntary participation in qualitative semi-structured interviews . This sub-sample will be purposely selected to include the maximum variation of characteristics , and 12 to 16 semi-structured individual interviews will be conducted for each study group . These interviews will explore perceptions of HPV , experiences as users of preventive care for HPV and related cancers , acceptability of and meanings related to HPV vaccination and barriers to and facilitators of primary prevention ( vaccination ) and secondary prevention ( screening and treatment ) of HPV . The study protocol and instruments were approved by the Research , Ethics and Biosecurity Committees of the National Institute of Public Health . All study participants will provide signed informed consent before participating in any study procedure or completing any study instruments ( and consent forms will be signed by two witnesses ) . Sample collection and vaccination At the beginning of the study , all MSM who agree to participate in the study will receive the HPV vaccination in an alternative schedule for MSM of 1 versus 2 doses over a 6-month period . In addition , a control group will be screened for high-risk HPV and vaccinated at 12 months . For transgender women , women and men living on the street , and women and men who have suffered rape , a 2-dose regimen of the tetravalent HPV vaccine will be administered over a 6-month period . The additional combined strategy corresponds to screening for high-risk HPV subtypes to identify intraepithelial lesions in the transformation zone of the anal and/or cervical canals . Additionally , samples will be self-collected from the anal canal , oral cavity , and vaginal canal . These samples will be collected both at the baseline measurement and at 12 months after vaccination to assess changes in the prevalence and incidence of new HPV infections in the different study groups . All HPV-positive anal and cervical samples will be evaluated using liquid-based cytology ; analysis will be done at the National Institute of Public Health . On a single occasion , additional samples will be collected from a proportional sample of the different study groups ( 70 % of MSM and 90 % of women , not including transgender women ) for the identification of other STIs , including Neisseria gonorrhea , syphilis , HIV , herpes simplex virus type 2 , hepatitis B virus , and hepatitis C virus . Positive cases will be referred to the corresponding medical care within their respective affiliated clinics . The HPV detection test has been installed at the National Institute of Public Health with the Cobas 4800 HPV platform . This test is a qualitative test that detects 14 high-risk genotypes using specific probes . It detects genotypes 16 and 18 individually and a pool of other types ( 31 , 33 , 35 , 39 , 45 , 51 , 52 , 56 , 58 , 59 , 66 , and 68 ) cataloged as high risk . Cytological evaluation will be conducted for all HPV-positive samples from both the anal canal and cervix . A urine sample will be obtained , centrifuged , and prepared for DNA extraction . The sample will be stored at -20°C prior to processing for HPV detection . The techniques for these purposes are under evaluation . Blood samples ( 10-ml ) will be collected from the study participants by vacuum venipuncture . The collected samples will be centrifuged to separate the sera into 2-ml aliquots , which will be stored in cryo-vials at -20°C prior to processing . Antibody responses to viral and bacterial etiological agents will be conducted as follows : Hepatitis B and hepatitis C. Automated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay . The analytical procedure will be conducted according to the corresponding manufacturer 's laboratory instructions , . Syphilis . The Venereal Disease Research Laboratory ( VDRL ) screening test and the Serodia Treponema pallidum ( TP ) confirmatory test by particle agglutination . The analytical procedures will be performed in accordance with the laboratory instructions of the corresponding manufacturers . Herpes simplex virus type 2 . Microplate immuno-enzymatic assay for the detection of type-specific viral antibodies . Confirmation of positive samples by Western blotting assay . The analytical procedures will be performed in accordance with the laboratory instructions of the corresponding manufacturers In cervical samples , an automated chemo-luminescent assay for bacterial DNA detection will be performed using polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) . The analytical procedure will be conducted according to the corresponding manufacturer 's laboratory instructions . Data analysis To estimate the effectiveness of the strategy of combining HPV vaccination with HPV screening , the differences in the prevalence of HPV and the cumulative incidence of HPV infection and/or development of CIN 2+ and/or AIN 2+ will be estimated during the first 12 months of follow-up using the Kaplan-Meier method .

A total of 40 patients ( 20 each arm ) aged 18-65 years old of either sex , and any race or ethnicity , presenting trigeminal neuropathic pain will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 parallel , double-blind clinical trial , to receive either Erenumab or placebo . Participants will attend 6 clinic visits ( Visit 0-Visit 5 ) over a period of 21 weeks . Changes in pain intensity and other pain related outcomes of trigeminal neuropathic pain will be assessed . Blood samples will be collected , and participants will need to keep a daily symptom diary and answer some other questionnaires .","TNP are a considerable burden and affects significantly the quality of life of the sufferer . There are medications for their management but while they may work for some patients , may not work for the others ; in addition , side effects may be present for some patients with the need to decrease dosage to not optimal levels . Furthermore , the indications of these drugs are for other neuropathic pain disorders and currently there is no medication specifically indicated for the management of TNP based on its molecular pathophysiology . The calcitonin gene-related peptide ( CGRP ) is a key neuropeptide involved in migraine pathophysiology . There is evidence showing that CGRP has a role in other disorders mediated by the trigeminal system in addition to migraine ; CGRP has shown to have a role in orofacial pain such as in TMD and in trigeminal neuropathic pain . Erenumab-aooe is the first antibody therapeutic targeting the CGRP receptor with FDA approval for migraine prevention that is well tolerated and with a good safety profile . Therefore , the scientific premise for this study is that inhibiting the CGRP pathway in trigeminal neuropathic pain will decrease pain and pain related outcomes in a safe and well tolerated manner for this patient population . Potential participants will be pre-screened at the Brotman Facial Pain clinic , at the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinic both at the University of Maryland , School of Dentistry , at the Pain Medicine Clinic at the University of Maryland , School of Medicine or by telephone ; those willing to participate will be scheduled for a screening and baseline visit ( Visit 0 ) .

Conventional treatment of DFUs are time consuming , burdensome , costly , and often do not treat the root cause of the problem . Even with proper care , ulcers can take a significantly longer time to heal in diabetic patients due to the altered physiology which does not allow for the proper nutrients and healing factors to mobilize to the site of injury , leaving these ulcers with a poor chance of healing and at high risk for infection and possible amputation . Supplemental immunonutrition therapy may offer a viable , low cost , rapidly scalable , and widely available approach to enhance the body 's ability to heal itself .

Study outcomes will lay the foundation for a multi-site clinical trial to establish the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of this strategy across the health care system .","Diabetes mellitus is one of the most prevalent chronic diseases in the world and its incidence is expected to increase over the next 20 years . Historically there are three described types of diabetes mellitus : Type 1 , Type 2 , and Gestational . The etiology of disease may vary between types , and our current understanding notes overlap of these types , yet the resulting pathophysiology is the same : poor peripheral blood flow , decreased cellular response at the injury site , elevated glucose levels , and poor nutrient transport . Despite many of these patients having an elevated Body Mass Index ( BMI ) , they are functionally under or malnourished . In addition , some patients develop progressive neurologic dysfunction , called peripheral neuropathy ( PN ) . A common complication of diabetes induced PN is the development of diabetic foot ulcers ( DFUs ) , which can have a devastating effect on patients ' lives and can lead to life threatening infection , amputations , and even death . Conventional treatment of DFUs includes shoe wear modification , self-monitoring , local wound care , brace and shoe offloading , and surgical intervention as well as more sophisticated treatments such as bioengineered cellular technologies and hyperbaric oxygen therapy . These modalities are time consuming , burdensome , costly , and often do not treat the root cause of the problem . Additionally , even with proper care , ulcers can take a significantly longer time to heal in diabetic patients due to the altered physiology which does not allow for the proper nutrients and healing factors to mobilize to the site of injury , leaving these ulcers with a poor chance of healing and at high risk for infection and possible amputation . In contrast to traditional treatment modalities , nutrition therapy has been shown to aide in healing of chronic wounds by providing essential nutrients which were not previously present in necessary amounts in diabetic patients . Nutrition therapy has proven useful in modulating inflammation and the immune response , optimizing glucose control , and attenuating the hypermetabolic response to ulcers , ultimately improving healing and recovery . Thus , supplemental immunonutrition therapy may offer a viable , low cost , rapidly scalable , and widely available approach to enhance the body 's ability to heal itself . This prospective , randomized pilot study will evaluate the effect of a 6-week daily oral course of a specific combination of immunonutrients , L-Arginine , Omega-3 fatty acids , and Vitamin C , on wound healing in diabetic patients with chronic lower extremity ulcers compared to traditional standard of care .

Approval was obtained from the institutional review board of BSMMU for this clinical trial ( Reference No : BSMMU/2018/25 , dated 01/01/2018 ) . Impacts of a single intra-articular ( IA ) injection of autologous adipose tissue derived total-stromal-cells ( TOST ) containing mesenchymal stem cells on pain , physical function , stiffness , and cartilage thickness assessed and compared before and after intervention . Patients satisfied the American College of Rheumatology ( ACR ) criteria for osteoarthritis ( OA ) knee included in the study . Kellgren-Lawrence ( KL ) radiological scores were used to define OA grade ; however , high-frequency musculoskeletal ultrasonogram ( MSUS ) was used to measure cartilage thickness . There is no standard protocol to follow while assessing cartilage thickness ; however , recent work of Podlipska and co-workers would be a worth consideration for using adipose tissue for cartilage regeneration . As medial tibio-femoral joint is the most commonly involved in KOA , here , we consider medial femoral cartilage thickness . The assessment used a commercially available ultrasound device ( Samsung Accuvix , 2010 , origin- South Korea ) with a 15 megahertz linear transducer ML6-15 . The patient was positioned supine with the knee in full flexion . A proximal-distal probe sweeping over the anterior-central knee area , medial femoral articular cartilage imaged in an axial plane . Degenerated cartilage signified either loss of surface sharpness or increased inner echogenicity ; local or total thinning of articular cartilage . The definitions for articular cartilage degeneration are as follows : Grade 0 - a monotonous anechoic band with sharp hyperechoic anterior and posterior interfaces , Grade 1 - loss of the average sharpness of cartilage interfaces and or increased echogenicity of the cartilage , Grade 2a - grade 1 plus thinning of articular cartilage less than 50 % , Grade 2b - more than 50 % but less than 100 % thinning of articular cartilage , Grade 3 -100 % local loss of the cartilage tissue .

The administration of opioids , local blocks and other analgesic medication is instituted to decrease the duration and intensity of postoperative pain as a part of a multimodal analgesic regimen . The transversusabdominis plane ( TAP ) block is a regional analgesic technique which blocks T6-L1 nerve branches and has an evolving role in postoperative analgesia for lower abdominal surgeries . In postoperative analgesia , efficacy of TAP block is equivalent to morphine with the additional benefits of increasing duration of analgesia , reducing postoperative opioid usage , with satisfactory pain relief and few side effects . The TAP block avoids the risk of neuraxial complications and opioid complications in all patients . TAP block the neural afferents of theanterior abdominal wall after spreading of the local anesthetic agent in the neurofascial plan between the internal oblique and transversusabdominis muscle . TAP block has been underutilized in spite of having very low complication and high success rate using ultrasound technique This may be due to the lack of availability of ultrasound at most of the centers , lack of training in ultrasound guided block technique . A new technique can be used in TAP block without the fear of complications in the blind landmark based approach.The advantage of this technique includes avoiding missing the second pop in obese and pregnant patients due to thinning of the internal obliqueaponeurosis , reposition of the needle by surgeon if one enters the peritoneal cavity accidentally . Also there are nil chances of visceral injury thus can be safely used by a beginner without any fear of complication . However , there might be a chance of needle stick injury to the surgeon 's hand .

Blood samples will be collected , and participants will need to keep a daily symptom diary and answer some other questionnaires .","Chronic TMD is a considerable burden and affects significantly the quality of life of the sufferer . For some patients , TMD has a tendency to remit or improve pain symptomatology over time but for others , TMD have the potential to become chronic and to lead to persistent dysfunction . Different classes of medications from anti-inflammatories , muscle relaxants , anxiolytics , antidepressants , anticonvulsants and a β-blocker have indicated to be beneficial for some patients as well as in clinical studies , but tolerability and side effects may be present for some patients . Furthermore , the indications of these drugs are for other disorders , so it is unclear their mechanism of action in TMD pathophysiology .

VA Loma Linda Health Care System,NCT05037032,Effects of Naltrexone on Nocturnal Breathing Patterns at Altitude,VA Loma Linda Health Care System,4,1,Altitude,Drug,Naltrexone Pill,Supportive Care,Triple,"Sleep at altitude is often poor . The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of a single dose of the opioid antagonist , naltrexone , on sleep quality and periodic breathing after rapid ascent to ~3800m altitude .","Sleep at high altitude is notoriously poor due to a combination of the unusual sleep environment and hypoxia during sleep . Many people develop what is called periodic breathing ( PB ) during sleep . PB may improve overall mean nocturnal oxygen saturation ( SpO2 ) although this is not entirely clear . Simultaneously , PB may further disturb sleep at altitude and has been associated with nighttime arousals from sleep . Medications that may decrease the amount of PB might improve sleep quality . The FDA approved drug , naltrexone , is a specific antagonist to the brain opioid receptors . It is a non-addicting drug which has never been studied at altitude . Clinical Relationships : Sleep disordered breathing is a very common disorder throughout the population , but it worsens with increasing age and BMI . At the same time , many in our Veteran population live in the local mountains and undoubtedly develop PB during sleep in addition to having obstructive sleep apnea . Objectives : The purpose to this study is to evaluate the effects of a single dose of naltrexone on PB and oxygen saturation during sleep at altitude in healthy young participants . The additional purpose will be to assess the subject-perceived sleep quality after the use of naltrexone vs. placebo . Research Design : A prospective , randomized , double-blind , crossover study . Methodology : We plan recruit up to 30 healthy study subjects with no history of sleep disordered breathing . Potential participants will be screened to ensure inclusion and exclusion criteria are met . A baseline low altitude sleep study will be preformed at home . No medication will be given before this baseline sleep study . The sleep study will be similar to the home sleep studies routinely used by the VA Loma Linda Healthcare System 's Sleep Center . Participants will be transported for High Altitude Trip 1 to the Barcroft Laboratory at the White Mountain Research Center ( WMRC ) at 3810 m altitude . At WMRC they will have a sleep study performed , similar to the baseline sleep study , after taking either a single dose of naltrexone or matching placebo . After an appropriate washout period ( at least 5 half-lives ) subjects will again be studied ( High Altitude Trip 2 ) taking the alternate medication ( naltrexone/placebo ) to the one used in the first study . Order of placebo vs. naltrexone will be randomized . Prior to sleep the subject will fill out questionnaires detailing how sleepy they are . On the morning following each sleep study , subjects will fill out a short questionnaire assessing the quality of their sleep . Impact/Significance : Improved knowledge of the mechanisms of PB in hypoxic environments will provide important insights into diagnostic and therapeutic decisions for Veterans who suffer from sleep disordered breathing .",2021-08-20,"April 24, 2023","Inclusion Criteria : Healthy males or females Age 18 to 35 years of age Body-mass index ( BMI ) ≤ 27 At least two weeks after full vaccination for Sars-CoV-2 .

Approximately 400 patients are expected to be enrolled in this study . Patients will be randomized 3:1 to receive FlecIH-103 at a total dose of up to 120 mg estimated total lung dose ( eTLD ) ( n=300 ) or placebo inhalation solution ( n=100 ) . Randomization will be stratified by geographic region ( US and ex-US ) and duration of symptoms of the current AF episode ( ≥1 hour to ≤24 hours and > 24 hours to ≤48 hours ) .","This is a Phase 3 , multicenter , randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled clinical study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of FlecIH-103 ( flecainide acetate inhalation solution ) compared with placebo in patients with recent-onset , symptomatic newly diagnosed or paroxysmal AF . Approximately 400 patients are expected to be enrolled in this study . The study will consist of the following periods : Screening , Observation , and Follow-up . The Screening Period comprises the time from the patient signing informed consent to the time of randomization . Screening begins at least 45 minutes prior to dosing and may be extended as needed due to site logistics . During screening , the patient will be evaluated for study eligibility , have a standard triplicate 12-lead ECG to confirm the diagnosis of AF , have a single-lead patch electrode applied for continuous ECG ( cECG ) recording , undergo a targeted physical examination ( including cardiovascular and respiratory systems ) , have blood drawn for laboratory assessments and a predose pharmacokinetic ( PK ) sample , have their AF-related symptoms assessed , have vital signs assessed periodically , and be monitored via telemetry to ensure they remain predominantly in AF prior to dosing ( ie , no period of SR ≥1 minute in duration or any abnormal rhythm other than AF ) . After confirmation that the patient meets all applicable eligibility criteria , randomization will take place using a central randomization system . The patient is considered enrolled at the time of randomization . The Observation Period comprises the time from randomization through 90 minutes after initiation of dosing . After randomization and just prior to the start of dosing ( T0 ) , the patient 's AF will again be confirmed by a standard triplicate 12-lead ECG ; patients who are not in AF at this time must be withdrawn . The patient will inhale the study drug until conversion of AF to SR occurs for ≥1 minute or the complete dose is administered , whichever occurs first . The complete dose of study drug comprises 2 separate 3.5-minute inhalations separated by a 1-minute break . Telemetric recording of ECG and cECG monitoring will continue and vital signs will be monitored periodically . A PK sample will be collected 2 minutes after completion of dosing followed by another standard triplicate ECG collected 5 minutes after completion of dosing . Finally , AF-related symptoms will be checked and a final PK sample will be collected at 90 minutes after initiation of dosing . Wherever a time point requires collection of ECG and/or vital signs in addition to a PK sample , the PK sample is collected last . If the patient 's AF converts to SR ( sustained for ≥1 minute ) as observed on telemetry during the Observation Period , vital signs and a standard triplicate 12-lead ECG will be recorded immediately following the time of conversion . The Investigator may not offer the patient another rhythm control therapy to cardiovert their AF to SR until after 90 minutes after initiation of dosing . At the end of the Observation Period ( ie , 90 minutes after initiation of dosing ) , the cECG patch will be removed and a standard triplicate 12 lead ECG will be recorded . If the patient 's AF converts to SR ( sustained for ≥1 minute ) after the Observation Period but prior to discharge ( eg , due to ECV or other PCV ) , a standard triplicate 12-lead ECG will be recorded at the time of conversion . The patient may be discharged per the Investigator 's discretion any time after completion of the 90-minute time point assessments . If patient discharge occurs > 1 hour after completion of the last 90-minute time point assessment , all 90-minute time point assessments must be repeated just prior to discharge , excluding the PK sample . The Follow-Up Period consists of 2 follow-up telephone contacts : one at 24 ( +12 ) hours after initiation of dosing , and one at 96 ( ±24 ) hours after initiation of dosing . The patient will also be given contact information and be instructed to contact the clinic in the event that any AF-related symptoms occur before these scheduled contact times . Follow-up contacts may also be performed by video call or in-person if the patient is at the clinic . During each follow-up contact , the patient will be queried for concomitant medications and procedures , AEs , AF-related symptoms , and AF-related interventions . End of study coincides with the 96-hour follow-up contact . An independent Data Monitoring Committee ( DMC ) will monitor safety throughout the study . An independent Clinical Events Committee ( CEC ) will review blinded data to adjudicate the primary and several secondary efficacy endpoints and to adjudicate CV events of special interest ( ie , hypotension , ventricular tachycardia , bradycardia , sinus pause , atrial flutter with 1:1 conduction , and other arrhythmias ) .",2021-08-09,"June 7, 2023","Inclusion Criteria : ≥18 and ≤85 years of age Recent onset of symptomatic newly diagnosed or paroxysmal AF Recent onset is defined as a symptom duration ≥1 and ≤48 hours at time of dosing Newly diagnosed AF is AF that has not been diagnosed previously , independent of its duration Paroxysmal AF is defined as recurrent AF in a patient whose previous AF episode ( s ) self-terminated ( ie , without treatment ) or terminated with intervention ≤7 days of onset .

Atherosclerosis is the most important cause of cardiovascular disease . Statins are known to exert a powerful anti-atherogenic action which is reflected in a marked beneficial effect on the prevention of cardiovascular effects and cardiovascular mortality . They induce a reduction in the progression and an increase in the regression of atherosclerotic lesions . Statins exert powerful effect on lowering LDLc and are also anti-inflammatory due to their ability to lower CRP concentrations . But little is known about their anti-inflammatory effects at a cellular and molecular levels in humans , in vivo . Vytorin , a preparation containing simvastatin and ezetimibe , has a powerful effect on lowering LDLc concentration through a combination of effects on the absorption of cholesterol from the gut and hepatic cholesterol biosynthesis . In our previous study we have shown that Vytorin exerts a potent anti-inflammatory effect in the obese in the fasting state and following acute inflammatory changes induced by the intake of cream . The IMPROVE-IT trial , which examined the benefits of adding ezetimibe to simvastatin , showed a small additional benefit of ezetimibe ( a 6 % reduction in cardiovascular events ) compared to simvastatin alone . This is marginal when compared to the established cardiovascular benefits of statins . We , therefore , explore further into the anti-inflammatory actions of the two components of Vytorin by comparing the effects of simvastatin versus ezetimibe on intracellular lipid and inflammation in obese patients to determine which of the two ingredients of Vytorin is responsible for the specific combination of these effects .",2020-10-07,"August 25, 2022","Inclusion Criteria : Age : 18 to 75 years of age .

The investigators aim to determine the effect of dosing on receipt of neuraxial anesthesia and pregnancy outcomes and evaluate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of unfractionated heparin in pregnancy .,"Venous thromboembolism is one of the leading causes of maternal morbidity and mortality , and antepartum hospitalizations place pregnant patients at an even higher risk of developing thromboembolism . As a result , there is an increased emphasis on administering pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis for antepartum patients with prolonged hospitalizations . Previously , standard dosing of unfractionated heparin was widely adopted for thromboprophylaxis in the pregnant population . However , due to a suspected altered metabolism of unfractionated heparin in pregnancy resulting in a decrease response , the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists ( ACOG ) currently recommends considering gestational age-based dosing for unfractionated heparin for thromboprophylaxis in pregnancy with standard dosing as an alternative option . The data supporting altered dosing is very limited . In addition , increased dosing of heparin may result in challenges in anesthetic management , potentially limiting the receipt of neuraxial anesthesia resulting in increased need for general anesthesia associated with both increased maternal and fetal risks . The potential effects of higher prophylactic unfractionated heparin dosing in pregnant patients need to be further explored before being widely adopted for inpatient antepartum thromboprophylaxis . The investigators propose this study to provide a direct comparison of gestational age-based unfractionated heparin dosing to standard dosing of unfractionated heparin for pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis of hospitalized antepartum patients .",2020-11-09,"April 26, 2023","Inclusion Criteria : At least 18 years of age Speak English or Spanish Antepartum admission for at least 72 hours at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center Provides informed consent for study participation Exclusion Criteria : Active or threatened antenatal bleeding Disseminated intravascular coagulation Risk of imminent delivery ( delivery within 12 hours ) Thrombocytopenia ( platelet count 36.2 seconds ) Concern for hemolysis , elevated liver enzymes , low platelet count ( HELLP ) syndrome Congenital bleeding disorders ( hemophilias ) Receiving therapeutic or prophylactic anticoagulation ( unfractionated heparin , low molecular weight heparin , oral anticoagulants ) for alternative indication ( e.g. , acquired or inherited thrombophilia , history of VTE ) History of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia ( HIT ) SARS-CoV-2 positive Cognitive impairment , psychiatric instability , or language barriers that limit their ability to provide informed consent Presence of a condition or abnormality that in the opinion of the Investigator would compromise the safety of the patient or the quality of the data .",46,1,18 Years,50 Years

Noorik Biopharmaceuticals AG,NCT04771000,A Study of Micro Dose Ambrisentan in Hospitalized Patients With Respiratory Insufficiency Due to COVID-19,Noorik Biopharmaceuticals AG,2,0,Covid19,Drug,Ambrisentan,Treatment,Triple,"Patients with COVID-19 frequently develop lower respiratory complications . Difficulty breathing and a low concentration of oxygen in the blood are of concern in patients with COVID-19 , as they indicate that the lungs may be significantly affected . In some patients , respiratory symptoms may progress to the point where oxygen support is needed ( i.e . use of an oxygen prongs , mask or ventilator ) . The exact mechanism of why patients with COVID-19 develop low concentrations of oxygen in blood is not fully understood . Some data suggest that the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 ( SARS-CoV-2 ) , the virus causing Coronavirus Disease 2019 ( COVID-19 ) , can affect the body 's blood vessels directly and extensively . In the lung , blood vessels participate in the absorption of oxygen . Endothelin is a potent hormone produced by human blood vessels . When increased , endothelin can result in the narrowing of blood vessels in the lung and decrease the volume of blood flowing through the lungs . This decrease in in blood flow through the lungs may be one of many factors affecting normal lung function . Ambrisentan can block the effects of endothelin in the body , and this could theoretically improve blood flow through the lungs . This study will evaluate whether ambrisentan , by blocking the effects of the hormone endothelin in the lungs , improves the breathing capacity of patients with COVID-19 , increases the concentration of oxygen in the blood and prevents the progression to respiratory failure and death . Ambrisentan is a drug that is currently used to treat patients with pulmonary hypertension , a disease where blood flow through the lungs is decreased . Subjects participating in this study are those patients hospitalised with severe respiratory symptoms related to COVID-19 , and are considered to be at high-risk of developing respiratory complications . Ambrisentan will be administered in the hospital , and will be continued at home for up to 28 days . In this study , ambrisentan will be administered at much lower doses that those used in patients with pulmonary hypertension .","This is a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , multi-centre trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ambrisentan for the treatment of severe COVID-19 . The population consists of hospitalized subjects who have a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 ( a coronavirus ( CoV ) ) infection , are at high-risk of progression to respiratory failure or death and have low oxygen saturation and/or require oxygen supplementation at the time of admission . Pregnant or lactating women will not be allowed to participate in this study given the teratogenic potential of ambrisentan . Subjects requiring mechanical ventilation or intubation at the time of enrolment are considered to have respiratory failure and will not be allowed into the study , as one primary objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of ambrisentan in preventing respiratory failure . Enrolled subjects will be randomly assigned to the treatment arm or control arm at a 1:1 ratio . In the treatment arm , subjects will receive ambrisentan on top of the standard-of-care . In the control arm , subjects will receive the administration vehicle only ( i.e. , placebo ) and on top of the standard of care . The study medication ( ambrisentan or placebo ) will be administered for up to 28 days . In the event that the subject is discharged between Day 4 and Day 28 , the subject will continue the study treatment at home until completion of the 28-day study medication regimen .

Master the clinical feathers , imaging features and laboratory diagnosis characteristics and economic costs of children pneumonia with higher D-dimer : Compare the characteristics of different groups of children in the course of the disease，clinicalsymptoms and signs ; All the children in the study need to do enhanced CT , to observe if there were intrapulmonary vascular thrombosis and necrosis pneumonia signs ; compared changes of coagulation index beside D-dimer . 2 . Compared with low molecular weight heparin prevention Disseminated intravascular coagulation（DIC） dose and instructions to the recommended dose in safety and effectiveness , and proposed elevated anticoagulation D-Dimer specification of the clinical treatment of children with pneumonia . Background and rationale : Pneumonia is the main cause of lung function injury and death in children . The high blood coagulation state can lead to the formation of pulmonary vascular thrombosis , local pulmonary ischemia and necrosis , which may be an important mechanism for the occurrence of necrotizing pneumonia and pulmonary embolism in children with pneumonia . Elevated D-dimer is an important predictor of pulmonary thrombosis and necrotizing pneumonia . At present , D-Dimer in many children with severe pneumonia is found to increase , the symptom is severe , the late stage of the performance of necrotizing pneumonia , seriously affect the children 's lung function and quality of life .","This is a randomized , controlled , single blind trial ( Researchers are not blind , patients are blind ) . 1.Patient population .Experience group We will recruit 93 cases in our trial.All of them are with simple pneumonia and are hospitalized in the respiratory department of our hospital , also D-dimer is higher than or equal to 500ug / L , 93 cases as the observation group , were randomly divided into A , B , C three sub group . .Control group We will recruit 31 cases in our control group.And children in this group are also with simple pneumonia , they will be similar with the experience group children at the age , the disease course but their D-Dimer is lower than 500 ug/L . 2.Randomized methods : A random number table was created by the statistical staff of the non-present research group using SAS to generate random numbers table before the start of the study . Selected children are in accordance with the A , B , C three groups of 1:1:1 ratio distribution . 3.Study method : Fasting venous blood was extracted from all the children from the second morning after admission to complete the coagulation function , blood routine , biochemical and related inflammatory indicators and complete chest CT examination。The above indicators were monitored dynamically during hospitalization . 4.Study protocal : Study group : Group A : Conventional treatment for children with pneumonia , without the use of low molecular weight heparin . Group B : Group B with prevention of DIC amount : low molecular weight heparin calcium 50-100 units / kg , once or twice subcutaneous injection , 5-10 days of treatment or D-Dimer recovery normal .

Control group will have a placebo treatment ( physiological saline ) . the negative RT-PCR date will be compared in the two groups","Introduction In 2020 The world is incurring coronavirus pandemic . The epidemic of the new coronavirus started in Wuhan , China , in late 2019 , originally called 2019-nCoV and then COVID-19 by the World Health Organization in February 2020 . COVID-19 presented a heavy health systems burden having caused more than 170,000 deaths worldwide as of April 20 , 2020 . However , the treatment protocols for this infection remain controversial . It is the subject of several ongoing studies . The use of vitamin D as a strategy to reduce the frequency and severity of respiratory infections and in particular COVID-19 must be seriously considered . Several studies have studied the role of vitamin D in reducing the risk of viral infections . Indeed , vitamin D supplementation could be a useful measure in improving the immune response of subjects affected by the new coronavirus . This , taking into account the high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in our country . The beneficial effects of vitamin D on protective immunity is partly due to innate immune system action . It reduces the cytokine storm induced by the innate immune system , by decreasing the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and increasing that of anti-inflammatory cytokines . Vitamin D played a major role in the modulation of adaptive immunity . However , evidence on the effectiveness of vitamin D in improving the immune response of confirmed COVID-19 remains lacking . The prolonged duration of the disease may increase the likelihood of transmission . Indeed , the R0 depends on three factors including the contact rate between individuals in the population , the probability of transmission of the infection during contact and the duration of infectiousness . The COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 has transmitted quickly as a global public health emergency . The median duration for Sars-CoV-2 carrying in COVID-19 patients was 20 days ( IQR 16-28 ) ( 9 ) . Research question : What is the role of vitamin D supplementation on the recovery time of asymptomatic and pauci-symptomatic COVID-19 subjects ? Objectives of the study : To assess the effect of vitamin D supplementation on the duration of carriage of the COVID-19 virus in patients with SARS Cov2 with a positive control RT-PCR on day 14 of the date of confirmation of the disease . Type of study : This is a randomized clinical trial without the patient 's knowledge in subjects diagnosed with COVID-19 . B . Method : Study setting : this study will be carried out in the governorate of Monastir in the collective isolation center Eligibility criteria : patients with SARS Cov2 and having a positive RT-PCR at control in 14 days from confirmation of infection for asymptomatic subjects and 7 days after the disappearance of symptoms for pauci-symptomatic subjects . Non-inclusion criteria : Pregnant women and children under the age of 18 will not be included . Intervention : the intervention group will have vitamin D supplementation ( 200,000 IU / 1 mL of Cholecalciferol ( 1 ml ) Oral form ) . Control group will have a placebo treatment ( physiological saline ) . Output : the negative RT-PCR date will be compared in the two groups . Variables : we will study the socio-demographic characteristics ( age , sex , level of study ) and the recovery dates ( dates of confirmation samples , disappearance of symptoms and control ) the presence of hospitalization . Sample size : for a gain of 07 days for healing , with 90 % power and a 2-sided 0.05 significance level , 130 patients were required ( 65 in each group ) . C.

Caffeine is known to non-specifically bind to adenosine receptors in the brain and to reduce resting blood flow while improving attention and cognitive function , which suggests that it may allow a more efficient dynamic blood flow regulation through neurovascular coupling . This study will use standardized dose of caffeine to test its effect on NVC responses in cerebral and retinal arterioles .","Normal brain function is critically dependent on moment-to-moment adjustment of cerebral blood flow to match demands of activated neurons . This process is known as neurovascular coupling ( NVC ) and recent in vivo studies demonstrate that impairment of NVC responses is associated with worse cognitive performance . Several methods are available to measure NVC responses in human subjects , including transcranial Doppler ( TCD ) , functional near infrared spectroscopy ( fNIRS ) , and dynamic retinal vessel analysis ( DVA ) . Although all these methodologies aim to measure hemodynamic changes in the brain vasculature in response to cognitive , motor , or visual stimulation , the responses are evaluated on the different levels of cerebral vasculature including microvasculature ( fNIRS ) , large cerebral vessels such as middle cerebral artery ( TCD ) , or in the arterioles and venules of the retina ( DVA ) .

Celon Pharma SA,NCT04670757,Safety and Pharmacokinetics of JAK/ROCK Inhibitor in Healthy Volunteers,Celon Pharma SA,1,1,Healthy,Drug,CPL409116,Treatment,Double,"The aim of the following clinical trial is to determine safety an pharmacokinetic parameters in healthy volunteers after oral administration of Janus kinases and Rho-kinases inhibitor ( JAK/ROCKi ) , called CPL409116.Janus kinase ( JAK ) inhibitors are a new class of small molecule drugs that modulate inflammatory pathways by blocking one or more JAK receptors . In recent years , JAK inhibitors have emerged as a new option for the treatment of various inflammatory diseases , including rheumatoid arthritis , psoriatic arthritis , spondyloarthritis , skin disorders and others . CPL409116 inhibits JAK1 and JAK3 with less inhibitory activity against JAK2 and Tyk2 . Inhibition of these kinases decreases inflammatory cytokine release which in turn decreases lymphocyte activation and proliferation . Moreover , CPL409116 blocks Rho-kinases ( ROCKs ) , which are involved in diverse cellular processes including actin cytoskeleton organization , cell adhesion and motility , proliferation , apoptosis as well as smooth muscle contraction . ROCKs signalling is one of the major pathways implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular , renal as well as fibrotic diseases . However recent data indicate their role in immune cell regulation and inflammatory disease development . CPL409116 was designed predominantly for the therapy of immune-related diseases : rheumatoid arthritis , psoriasis and because antifibrotic therapies are needed . Dual inhibition of JAK/ROCK kinases may be beneficial for patients suffering from fibrotic complications of inflammatory disease . Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease characterised by persistent joint inflammation leading to loss of joint function as well as cartilage and bone damage . Chronic , progressive course of the disease results in disability , reduced quality of life , as well as higher comorbidity and mortality rates . It is well documented that JAK kinases play a pivotal role in cytokine receptor signalling to phosphorylate and activate signal transducer and activator of transcription ( STAT ) proteins . Several of these JAK-controlled cytokine receptor pathways are immediately involved in the initiation and progression of RA pathogenesis . Cytokines promote autoimmunity , maintain chronic inflammatory synovitis and drive the destruction of joint tissue . In consequence on the basis of the preclinical study results the IMP with the active ingredient CPL409116 has been classified as a good clinical candidate for the treatment of RA .",The following clinical trial consists of two phases IA and IB . Approximately 68 volunteers who meet all the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria are going to be enrolled into the study .

It is the main cause of morbidity and mortality among children . The management of malaria cases is based on the principle of early diagnosis and rapid treatment with effective drugs . It is confronted with the appearance of strains resistant to antimalarial drugs , hence the need to monitor antimalarial drug sensitivity . The study was conducted in three regions representing epidemiological strata of the country : Agadez ( Centre de santé Intégré of Dagamanet in the Health district of Agadez ) , Maradi ( Centre de santé intégré of Guindaoua in Tessaoua ) and Dosso ( Centre de santé Intégré centre in Gaya ) . The protocol used is the WHO standardized protocol of 2009 . Artemether/Lumefantrine ( AL ) was administered with a 28-day follow-up in children aged 3 months to 15 years . A Polymerase Chain Reaction ( PCR ) correction is planned to differentiate between treatment failure and re-infestation as well as a study of genes responsible for resistance on the main drugs used .","The study took place from September 1 to October 31 , 2020 at the time of peak malaria transmission . It took place at three sentinel sites of the National Malaria Control Program ( NMCP ) . These were in the regions of i ) Agadez at the Centre de Santé Intégré ( CSI ) of Dagamanet in the Agadez district , ii ) Dosso at the CSI centre in the health district ( HD ) of Gaya iii ) Maradi at the CSI Guindaoua in the HD of Tessaoua . These sites were identified by the NMCP because of their high attendance rate and belong to 3 different malaria epidemiological strata . As the treatment failure rate of artemether lumefantrine ( AL ) in the regions is unknown , 5 % was chosen . With a confidence level of 95 % and a precision around the estimate of 5 % , a minimum of 73 patients were included . The number of patients was increased by 20 % to account for possible dropouts and withdrawals during the 28/42 day follow-up period , 88 patients were included in the study per site .

The current strategy to control STH in endemic areas is mass administration of albendazole or mebendazole , mainly to pre-school and school-aged children . Although this treatment works well for some STH species , efficacy against Trichuris trichiura is poor and it is not effective Strongyloides stercoralis . Thus new drugs or drug combinations are an urgent priority to increase the effectiveness of control programmes . Furthermore , the World Health Organisation has recommended combination therapy of ivermectin with albendazole . The trial proposed , is an adaptive phase II/III trial where the phase II component will evaluate the safety of the FDC as a single dose or 3-day single dose regimen for the treatment of T. trichiura in paediatric population . After analysis of the safety results the phase III trial will be executed to evaluate the efficacy of the FDC as a single dose or 3-day single dose regimen compared to the standard single dose regimen of ALB ( 400 mg ) for the treatment of T. trichiura , hookworm and S. stercoralis in paediatric and young adult population . The estimated total sample size for the adaptive design ( phase II and III component ) is 1223 participants .

Phase II component ( Kenya only ) Unicentric , 3-arm , parallel , open-label , individually randomised , phase II trial to determine in three weight groups , the safety of the ALBENDAZOLEIVERMECTIN Co-formulation given as a Single Day or 3-day Single Dose regimen for the treatment of Trichuris trichiura in children and young adult aged between 5 to 18 years . Estimated sample size : 126 participants Participants will be stratified in three different weight groups in order to gradually increase the dose of ivermectin in the Fixed Dose Co-formulation ( FDC ) : Group 1 ( 38 participants ) : with body weight of 23- < 30 Kg will receive 300-391 µg/Kg IVM ( FDC 400mg-9mg ) or ALB Group 2 ( 38 participants ) : with body weight of 30-45 Kg will receive 400-600 µg/Kg IVM ( FDC 400mg-18mg ) or ALB . Group 3 ( 50 participants ) : with body weight of 15-23 Kg will receive 391-600 µg/Kg IVM ( FDC 400mg-9mg ) or ALB . Where FDC stands for Fixed Dose Co-formulation and ALB stands for Albendazole . Then , the participants will be allocated to one of the three study arms with unequal probability ( ALB : p=0.2 , n=26 ; FDCx1 : p=0.4 , n=50 ; FDCx3 : p=0.4 , n=50 ) starting with group 1 . Treatment Arm 1 : Single dose of a tablet of ALBENDAZOLE 400 mg ( active control arm ) . Treatment Arm 2 : Single dose of a tablet of ALBENDAZOLEIVERMECTIN Co-formulation .

Phase III Component A multi-centre , 3-arm , parallel , open-label , randomised , phase III trial to compare safety and efficacy of the active control arm ( current standard of care ) against 2 experimental arms for the treatment of T. trichiura , hookworm and S. stercoralis , in children and young adult aged between 5-18 years in three subSaharan African countries ( Ethiopia , Kenya and Mozambique ) We hypothesise that the FDC of Ivermectin ( IVM ) and ALB either at single or 3- day regimens will be more effective against some species of Soil Transmitted Helminths ( STH ) ( T. trichiura , hookworm and S. stercoralis ) compared to the current use of a single dose regimen of 400mg ALB . Estimated sample size : 1097 participants Participants will be randomly allocated with unequal probability , according to the specific expected cure rate by treatment and specie , to one of the three study treatment arms . Treatment Arm 1 : Single dose of a tablet of ALB 400 mg ( active control arm ) . Treatment Arm 2 : Single dose of a tablet of FDC 400mg-18mg or 400mg-9mg . For participants < 45 kg of body weight at baseline : FDC of 400mg ALB- 9mg IVM . For participants ≥45 kg of body weight at baseline : FDC of 400mg ALB-18mg IVM .

For participants ≥45 kg of body weight at baseline : FDC of 400mg ALB- 18mg IVM . In the phase III component , allocation of participants to study arms will be done by block randomization and stratified by the species of STH . Treatment allocation for each study participant will be concealed in opaque sealed envelope that will be opened only after enrolment . Study participants will be assigned a unique number linked to the allocated treatment group . The phase II and III trial components comprise of a screening phase , an enrolment phase , a treatment phase , a post-treatment phase with follow-up visits , and early withdrawal/end-of-study evaluations .

Methods : This was a randomized controlled trial of 200 women who attended the outpatient clinic of Menoufia University Hospital for elective cesarean surgery . The women were randomly assigned to two groups . The intervention group received PRP after surgery , whereas the control group received the usual care . Outcomes included Redness , Edema , Ecchymosis , Discharge , Approximation ( REEDA ) scale , Vancouver scar scale ( VSS ) , and the visual analog scale ( VAS ) .","The investigators conducted this randomized controlled trial from April 2018 to July 2020 at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Menoufia University Hospital , which is a large tertiary center in the Delta region in Egypt with a delivery rate of about 10000 per year . This study was approved by Menoufia university hospital ethical committee Institutional review board ( 198190PSGN33 ) . The investigators obtained informed consent from all participants before initiating any study procedures . CONSORT guidelines were observed and completed . The patients included in the study were between 20 and 40 years of age . Eligible women had one or more of the following risk factors : Body mass index ( BMI ) > 30 kglcm2 , prior cesarean section , pregestational or gestational diabetes , hypertensive disorders of pregnancy , placenta Previa , twin pregnancy , anemia , and corticosteroid medication . Exclusion criteria were chronic pain disorders , hepatitis , thrombocytopenia , and coagulation disorders . The investigators randomized participants in a 1:1 ratio to two equal groups containing one hundred patients each ( intervention and control groups ) . A statistician not directly involved in the study prepared a computer generated randomization list and placed the allocation information in sequentially numbered sealed envelopes that were opened according to the attendance of the patients after signing the informed consent . The study authors were unaware of the envelope allocation sequence . Participants and outcome assessors did not know which group had been assigned to for the duration of the study . In the operating room before the start of each procedure , approximately 15 cm of whole blood was drawn from the uninvolved arm of each patient in the intervention group ( group I ) into a 20 ml sterile syringe containing citrate for anticoagulation . The blood was immediately centrifuged at 3200 Revolutions per Minute ( PRM ) . Following 15 minutes of centrifugation , 4 - 5 mL of PRP was obtained . Then , the PRP was buffered by using sodium bicarbonate . After closure of the fascia and prior to skin closure , PRP was directly applied to the subcutaneous tissue of the wound site by using a sterile syringe . In the control group ( group II ) , the patients did not receive topical treatment and the subcutaneous tissue was cleaned with normal saline before skin closure . For all patients , the skin was closed with polyprolene 2-0 suture with a curved cutting needle . The patients were examined by the physicians who were blinded to the group allocation on day 1 , and then day 7 and 6 months after the procedure . Pain was evaluated by the visual analog scale system ( VAS ) which assesses changes of pain via a continuous measurement instrument that is operationally comprised of a horizontal line , anchored at each end by verbal descriptors such as no pain and the worst pain imaginable . The subject is asked to indicate a spot on the scale that best represents her degree of pain . The score is determined by measuring the distance ( mm ) between the no pain anchor to the point that the patient marks , providing a range of scores from 0 - 10 . A higher score indicates greater pain intensity . The primary outcome was the Redness , Edema , Ecchymosis , Discharge , Approximation ( REEDA ) scale for assessing the changes in wound healing . REEDA as a descriptive scale has 4 points in a categorical score that measures 5 items of healing : redness ( hyperemia ) , edema , ecchymosis , discharge , and approximation of the wound edges ( coaptation ) . Each item is rated on a scale of 0 to 3 , and total scores may range from 0 to 15 . A lower score indicates better healing . The secondary outcomes were measured by Vancouver scar scale ( VSS ) and VAS . VSS use to detect changes of formation of keloids or hypertrophic scars . It assesses 4 subjective variables : vascularity , height/thickness , pliability , and pigmentation within a possible range of 0 - 14 for the total score . The sample size was calculated by using Epi-Info program version 3.5.4 by adjusting confidence interval to 95 % . With an alpha error of 5 % and study power of 80 % and assuming a clinically relevant reduction in REEDA and VSS scores based on results of previous studies , the invesigators estimated a total sample size of 182 women ( 91 for each group ) . This was increased to 200 women considering about 10 % drop out rate . The data collected , were tabulated and analyzed by SPSS ( statistical package for the social science software ) statistical package version 20 ( Chicago Inc. , USA ) , the following tests were used ; Quantitative data were expressed as mean and standard deviation ( X ± SD ) and analyzed by applying student t test . Qualitative data were analyzed by Chi Square test .

Getz Pharma,NCT04665284,Safety And Efficacy Of Empagliflozin In Pakistani Muslim Population With Type Ii Diabetes Mellitus,Getz Pharma,4,1,Type II Diabetes Mellitus,Drug,Empagliflozin,Treatment,,To compare the safety and efficacy of empagliflozin versus other treatments in Pakistani Muslim population with type II diabetes mellitus .,"Diabetes is the one of the most common non-communicable diseases affecting 425 million adults worldwide . This figure is expected to rise to 629 million by the year 2045.1 90 % of the diabetic population has type 2 diabetes . 2 As of 2018 , more than 500 million individuals are residing with type 2 diabetes mellitus globally . 3 In Pakistan , the situation is similarly alarming . According to a recent survey , 16.98 % of the Pakistani population has diabetes.4 The primary target of therapy in diabetes mellitus is optimum blood glucose control . In case of type 2 diabetes , this is achieved by a combination of oral hypoglycemic agents and injectable drugs with insulin as a last resort . A number of oral agents targeting various sites of action are available . Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 ( SGLT2 ) inhibitors are newer class of drugs that have been introduced . They have a unique mechanism of action . By acting at the sodium glucose co-transporter , they block the reabsorption of glucose leading to an increase in urinary glucose excretion and lowering of plasma glucose.5 This action is completely independent of the beta cell function . There are several theoretical advantages to this approach . In addition to lowering blood glucose , the urinary glucose excretion results in loss of calories and weight reduction and the associated osmotic diuretic effect can aid in lowering blood pressures.6,7 Numerous studies have demonstrated a favorable risk benefit ratio of empagliflozin as monotherapy8 as well as add-on therapy to other hypoglycemic agents.9,10,11,12 They also have additional cardiovascular benefits with several studies documenting a reduction in mortality.13,14 Moreover , the sodium glucose co-transporters also demonstrated a reduction in the onset and worsening of nephropathy and preservation of renal function.15 This effect is not restricted to empagliflozin alone , as other drugs in the class have also demonstrated this benefit.16 Empagliflozin with its novel mechanism of action has its own set of side effects . Increased urinary glucose losses lead to a higher proportion of urinary tract infections and genital tract infections . This has been evidenced in various studies.17 The osmotic diuresis that benefits in lowering blood pressures at one end , also predisposes the patients to volume depletion.Empagliflozin , one of the three drugs from this class , approved by the FDA for treatment of type 2 diabetes . According to the recent ADA and the EASD guidelines , they have become an essential component of the algorithm recommended for managing type 2 diabetes.18 The recently published consensus statement by the South Asian Federation of Endocrine Societies has incorporated sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes as monotherapy in patients who are intolerant to or have any contraindication to metformin therapy . Additionally , drugs belonging to this class are also recommended as combination therapy with other oral hypoglycemic agents as well as insulin.19 Empagliflozin , however , has not been studied in the Pakistani population as yet . The main aim of this study is to establish the efficacy and safety of empagliflozin in optimum control of blood sugar in type 2 diabetes . This is the first study of its kind being performed in the Pakistani population .",2020-11-27,"December 10, 2020","Inclusion Criteria : Pakistani muslim male / female , type 2 diabetic patient having age from 18 years to 75 years Patient who give informed consent voluntarily BMI ≤45 kg/m2 Glycosylated hemoglobin of 7 - ≤10 % Exclusion Criteria : Patients who are on empagliflozin treatment Indication of liver disease , defined by serum levels of either alanine aminotransferase , aspartate aminotransferase , and alkaline phosphatase above 3 times upper limit to normal Estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) < 45 mL /min /1.73m2 History of recurrent urinary tract infection ( UTI ) and/or past 3 months ' history of UTI and its treatment Patients with positive urine culture for UTI at the time of screening Patients who have been admitted to the hospital in the past 3 months for diabetic ketoacidosis ( DKA ) and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state Patients with past 3 months ' history of fungal infection and its treatment History of blood dyscrasias or any disorders causing haemolysis or unstable red blood cell History of benign prostate hyperplasia Any acute coronary syndrome , stroke and/or transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) in the previous 3 months Any contraindication for patients to Biguanides , Sulfonylureas , DPP-IV inhibitors , SGLT-2 Inhibitors Treatment with anti-obesity drugs or any other treatment leading to unstable body weight Patients with past 6 weeks treatment history with systemic steroids or thyroid hormones or any other uncontrolled endocrine disorder except T2DM Pre-menopausal women who are nursing or pregnant or are of childbearing potential and not practicing an acceptable method of birth control Any other clinical condition that would jeopardize patients safety while participating in this study",244,0,18 Years,75 Years

Institut Universitari Dexeus,NCT04992468,Dual Trigger for Elective Fertility Preservation,Fundación Santiago Dexeus Font,4,1,Infertility,Drug,Ovulation triggering with GnRH-a+rhCG,Treatment,,"The widespread availability of efficient contraception as well as women 's increased education has led to childbearing postponement . Combined with the increased recognition of the concept of `` ovarian aging '' , this has opened the Pandora´s box of EOC , which is currently considered a safe and cost-efficient approach among assisted reproduction techniques . Previous studies have shown that two main factors determine the CLBR after EOC : 1 ) patient 's age at the time of oocyte banking , and 2 ) the number of oocytes retrieved . Therefore , measures aiming at increasing the oocyte yield , specially the number of mature oocytes retrieved , will maximize the success of this technique . In the last few years , the dual trigger for final oocyte maturation has emerged has an approach that seems to improve both oocyte yield and quality when compared to the hCG trigger alone . Nowadays , the standard of care in EOC patients is final oocyte maturation with a single bolus of GnRH-a . Understanding the impact of the dual trigger on the number of MII oocytes retrieved in patients undergoing EOC will improve the treatment protocols and allow for a better patient counselling .","Elective oocyte cryopreservation ( EOC ) has been gaining increasing importance in the last few years , driven by the widespread information regarding the concept of 'age-related fertility decline ' , as well as the availability of efficient contraception and women 's increasing educational and professional aspirations . Considering the similar clinical outcomes regarding live birth rate after vitrified-warmed and fresh oocytes and the proven cost-effectiveness of this approach , oocyte banking is now considered an efficient technique in assisted reproduction . Previous studies have shown that both patient 's age and the number of oocytes retrieved have a significant impact on the cumulative live birth rate ( CLBR ) in patients undergoing EOC , highlighting the importance of maximizing oocyte yield in these patients . In all these former reports , final follicular maturation was triggered by one bolus of human chorionic gonadotropin ( hCG ) or , following recent trends in clinical practice , by a single bolus of Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone agonist ( GnRH-a ) . More recently , the concomitant administration of both GnRH-a and a bolus of HCG prior to oocyte retrieval ( dual trigger ) has been proposed as a new strategy for final follicular maturation , aiming to improve oocyte and embryo quality . When compared to HCG trigger , the dual trigger adds the more physiologic follicular stimulating hormone ( FSH ) and luteinizing hormone ( LH ) peak provided by GnRH-a . With this approach , several studies have reported an increase in the number of MII oocytes retrieved , as well as in the number of good quality embryos and improved pregnancy outcomes in different subpopulations of infertile patients . Nowadays , the standard of care in patients undergoing a freeze-all approach , either for oocyte or embryo cryopreservation , is final follicular maturation with GnRH-a due to its more physiologic and shorter surge of both LH and FSH , terminating 24h after its onset , and reducing the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ( OHSS ) . So far , no study has compared the dual trigger approach to the use of a single bolus of GnRH-a . By adding HCG activity and , therefore , generating higher intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate ( cAMP ) accumulation , an amplification of the steroidogenic response of the pre-ovulatory follicle might be achieved with the dual trigger when compared to the GnRH-a trigger alone . Therefore , the investigators set out to perform this randomized controlled trial aiming to compare , for the first time , the dual trigger and the GnRH-a trigger regarding the number of MII oocytes retrieved in patients undergoing EOC .",2021-07-05,"July 24, 2023","Inclusion Criteria : Able and willing to sign the Patient Consent Form and adhere to study visitation schedule antral follicle count ( AFC ) =18 and ≤40 years BMI > 18 and < 30 kg/m2 Exclusion Criteria : Medically indicated fertility preservation AFC ≥ 20 Polycystic ovarian syndrome ( PCOS ) according to the Rotterdam criteria FSH ≥ 20 History of untreated autoimmune , endocrine or metabolic disorders Contraindication for hormonal treatment Recent history of severe disease requiring regular treatment ( clinically significant concurrent medical condition that could compromise subject safety or interfered with the trial assessment ) .",136,1,18 Years,40 Years

COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organisation on 11 March 2020 . To date , tens of millions of cases have been reported and over 3 % of these cases have died . COVID-19 is an acute respiratory disease caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus from the Betacoronavirus genus , just like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV . SARS-CoV-2 is primarily transmitted person-to-person through respiratory droplets/close contact . Fomite transmission has also been shown as a transmission route . Common respiratory symptoms such as fever , sore throat , cough & shortness of breath , may appear 2 - 14 days after exposure . About 20 % of infected cases progress to severe disease resulting in an estimated 2 - 5 % mortality rate . With the unrelenting increase in cases being reported worldwide , there is thus an urgent need for therapeutics to be developed to treat disease & reduce further transmission in order to disrupt the ongoing pandemic . To date , there are no specific proven antiviral treatment to prevent disease progression from mild to severe respiratory dysfunction among COVID-19 patients . Supportive care is recommended for symptom relief & for severe cases . Numerous vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2 are under development . Tychan 's TY027 , a fully engineered human IgG , is one of the first few biologics in the world , specifically targeting SARS-CoV-2 , to enter human clinical trials . Preliminary data from our phase 1 healthy volunteer trial ( SCT-001 ; ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT04429529 ) reveals that TY027 is safe & well-tolerated up to 20 mg/kg tested . A total of 10 adverse events ( AEs ) were observed , all were of mild in intensity with none resulting in subject withdrawal from the study . There were no serious adverse events & no clinically relevant trends in mean clinical laboratory , physical examinations , vital signs or ECG results were observed . Pharmacokinetic profile of subjects across dose cohorts 1 - 4 , up to Day 14 , were comparable to those typical of human IgG1 antibody with serum concentrations declining in a biphasic manner . Exposure of TY027 , based on Cmax , increased in a linear & generally dose proportional manner . It is anticipated that TY027 , when administered to acutely infected COVID-19 patients , could reduce disease severity . It may potentially also be used as a prophylaxis against COVID-19 amongst high risk contacts .","This is a Phase 3 Multi-Site , Randomised , Placebo Controlled , Double Blind , Single Dose Study of TY027 for Early Treatment of COVID-19 . Efficacy and safety of single dose IV infusion of TY027 in COVID-19 patients will be assessed . A total of 1,305 COVID-19 patients will be enrolled . The first 15 patients will be randomised 1:1:1 to receive either ( i ) a single fixed dose of 1,500 mg TY027 , ( ii ) a single fixed dose of 2,000 mg TY027 or ( iii ) Placebo ( N = 5 per group ) for initial safety assessment . This safety assessment will comprise the safety review of clinical signs , adverse events ( AEs ) and laboratory test results up to Day 3 post-dose . Subsequent patients will be randomised 1:1 to receive either a single fixed dose of 2,000 mg TY027 ( 2,000 mg TY027 group ) or Placebo ( Placebo group ) ( N = 645 per group ) . All patients will be inpatient for up to 7 days post-dosing and followed up on Days 14 and 28 . If a patient becomes clinically well enough for discharge before Day 7 , at the discretion of attending physician , collection of subsequent events/parameters such as abbreviated physical examinations , vital signs , clinical laboratory assessments , pharmacodynamic assessment , biomarker assessment , disseminated intravascular coagulation assessment scheduled after discharge will no longer be feasbile . Conversely , if a patient was to be hospitalised beyond 7 days for medically indicated reasons , daily monitoring and medical assessment will continue , with any additional ad hoc sampling to be recorded as unscheduled visit ( s ) . Remote monitoring through a telephone or video call will be performed on days post-discharge as per originally scheduled in schedule of events , as well as on Day 14 while patients are serving their quarantine order or has been discharged home . All discharged patients are to contact the Principal Investigator or the study team as soon as possible should they experience a worsening of their condition , or if they are admitted to hospital for COVID-19-related symptoms , before their Day 28 visit .

For all participants , gender and age were recorded , and periodontal parameters such as periodontal pocket depth ( PPD ) , clinical attachment level ( CAL ) and bleeding on probing ( BoP ) measurements were taken from six periodontal sites on all teeth ( except for the third molars ) by a single calibrated examiner using a manual periodontal probe ( dental explorer tool labeled 0106.DT06.CP10 , Den Tag , Italy ) . PPD and CAL were measured to the nearest 1 mm . All patients were clinically examined before treatment and after 1 month ± 5 days . Collection of gingival tissue samples For the precise immunohistochemical study , the gingival biopsy of approximately 3x3 mm was excised under local anesthesia before treatment and 1 month later in 5 selected patients per group . Biopsies were obtained in the same time-points , from a single site displaying the deepest pocket around suitable dental and periodontal procedures . Removal of these tissue biopsies did not interfere with the initial treatment plan or influence upon the expected clinical outcomes . After collection , biopsies were fixed in a 4 % formalin solution for 24 hr of fixation , dehydrated , and embedded in paraffin . Immunohistochemistry and antibodies Paraffin sections , 2-3 μm in thickness were deparaffinized and dehydrated . Heat-induced epitope retrieval in citrate buffer , power of hydrogen ( pH ) 6 , was performed by successive heating the slides in the microwave oven , then allowed to cool , rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) , incubated with blocked reagent , rinsed , and incubated with mouse monoclonal CD68 antibodies ( 1:30 , clone PG-M1 , Diagnostic BioSystems , The Hague , The Netherlands ) or anti-CD163 ( 1:100 , clone 10D6 , Diagnostic BioSystems , The Hague , The Netherlands ) . Then sections were stained with the 2-steps Mouse/Rabbit PolyVue Plus™ HRP/DAB Detection System ( Diagnostic BioSystems , The Hague , The Netherlands ) , and counterstained with Mayer 's haemalaun . PBS was used as a negative control , the lymph node tissue - as a positive control . Evaluation of immunohistochemical staining CD68+ and CD163+ macrophages ( Mφs ) were estimated by counting the number of the cells by light microscope ×400 in intensive infiltrative areas , 5 regions from each slice were selected , and all 5 counts were taken for statistics . We counted immunopositive Mφs in the areas of cell infiltration , since they are directly related to inflammation . The number of cells per 10 000 μm2 was calculated as immunopositive cell density . Photos were obtained using the light microscope Axio Lab.A1 ( Carl Zeiss , Göttingen , Germany ) ( ×400 ) . Statistical analysis Small sample size was justified by the expectation of a high effect size , unknown null distribution , and compensated with adequate power non parametric statistics . Precise sample size calculation was not performed . Means of PPD and CAL were calculated for sites with PD > 4mm ( affected sites ) . Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 5 software ( GraphPad Software , San Diego , USA ) by means of descriptive statistics , chi-square test , one-way ANOVA and nonparametric ANOVA tests for multiple comparisons : Friedman - for dependent variables , Kruskal-Wallis test - for independent variables , with post-hoc analyzing . For descriptive statistics of cells numbers , the percentile ranges were also used because of non-normal distributions . The CD68+/CD163+ ratio was assessed by inter-group t-tests comparisons and Spearman correlation checking . P values of < 0.05 were considered statistically significant in all of the analyses .",2021-08-31,"September 11, 2021","Inclusion Criteria : Presence of periodontitis Good general health At least 19 remaining teeth Written informed consent forms Exclusion Criteria : Antibiotics or anti-inflammatory medications use within the preceding 3 months Periodontal therapy within the previous 6 months Purulent exudation from periodontal pockets Pregnancy and breastfeeding Presence of severe , uncontrolled ( decompensated ) diseases of the internal organs , or neuropsychiatric disorders Presence of other conditions that determined the inability of the patient to understand the nature and possible consequences of the study",75,0,25 Years,54 Years

SKI-O-592 ( the free base of SKI-O-703 ) has demonstrated high selectivity and potency against spleen tyrosine kinase in a biochemical assay . For immunoreceptor activation linked to SYK , the effect of SKI-O-592 on the anti-inflammatory response consisting of tumor necrosis factor alpha , β-hexosaminidase , and CD69 expression was greater than the effects of first-generation SYK inhibitors ( eg , R406 ) in several immune cell lines and in human primary cells . This anti-inflammatory activity was responsible for the selective inhibition of p-SYK ( Y525/526 ) , which led to the sequential inhibition of downstream effectors . In vitro studies revealed excellent SYK selectivity of SKI-O-592 that led to no inhibition of SYK-independent signal pathways , indicating that SKI-O-592 shows more potent anti-inflammatory activity to allow continuous administration of SKI-O-703 compared with the first-generation SYK inhibitors .

Vaginal Biome Science,NCT05390606,Effects of Flourish HEC and BioGenesis to Improve Conception,Vaginal Biome Science,1,0,Infertility,Combination Product,Flourish HEC and BioGenesis,Other,,This study intends to address whether improving the vaginal microbiome can help couples increase chances of conceiving .,"Disrupted vaginal microbiomes are associated with a number of poor reproductive outcomes , including infertility , miscarriage , premature rupture of membranes , preterm labor and delivery , delivery of a low birthweight baby , and maternal infections ( chorioamnionitis , endometritis ) . A healthy vaginal microbiome is typically thought to be one that is dominated by one of several Lactobacillus species , such as L. crispatus , L. gasseri , or L. jensenii . Several studies have shown that non-lactobacilli-dominant biomes are associated with poor in vitro fertilization or intrauterine insemination outcomes . Fewer studies have examined fertility in the home setting , and none to date has asked whether improving the vaginal microbiome ( VMB ) could increase fertility . This study addresses both . By assessing the VMB before and after using a vaginal care system which supports a healthy VMB , we will be able to examine whether there are associations between VMB composition and infertility , and whether shifting the VMB toward a lactobacillus-dominant state is able to improve chances of conception . In this study , women will either follow routine care ( control ) or routine care plus the vaginal care system and fertility lubricant ( intervention ) for 3 months or until becoming pregnant , whichever comes first . In addition to tracking conception rates during those 3 months , we will follow women for an additional year following completion of the 3-month timeframe . If any woman is pregnant at the one-year mark , her pregnancy will be followed until delivery ( or early termination ) to track delivery outcomes and adverse events .",2022-05-18,"July 17, 2023","Inclusion Criteria : Women part of a cisgender couple aged 18 to 40 who are attempting to become pregnant and are attending a fertility clinic .

Kasr El Aini Hospital,NCT05051150,Epinephrine Infusion for Prophylaxis Against Maternal Hypotension During Caesarean Section,Kasr El Aini Hospital,4,0,Post-spinal Hypotension,Drug,Epinephrin 0.03,Prevention,Quadruple,"Maternal hypotension after spinal block is a common complication after subarachnoid block in this population . The incidence of maternal hypotension is nearly 60 % when prophylactic vasopressors are not used . Therefore , it is highly recommended to use vasopressors , preferably as continuous infusion , for prophylaxis rather than delaying their use until hypotension occurs . Phenylephrine ( PE ) is the recommended drug for prophylaxis against hypotension during cesarean delivery ; however , the use of PE is commonly associated with decreased heart rate and probably cardiac output because PE is a pure alpha adrenoreceptor agonist . Introduction of NE in obstetric practice had shown favorable maternal and neonatal outcomes and was associated with higher heart rate and cardiac output compared to PE . However , there is still some mothers who develop bradycardia and diminished cardiac output with the use of NE . The most desired scenario during hemodynamic management of mothers during cesarean delivery would achieve the least possible incidences of maternal hypotension , bradycardia and reactive hypertension . Therefore , it is warranted to reach a vasopressor regimen with the most stable hemodynamic profile . In the last year , epinephrine was reported for the first time in obstetric practice with acceptable safety on the mother and the fetus . However , there is still lack of data about the most appropriate dose for infusion during cesarean delivery . In this study , we aim to compare three prophylactic infusion rates for epinephrine during cesarean delivery .","Upon arrival to the operating room , the patient will be in supine position with left uterine displacement using a wedge below the right buttock . Routine monitoring will be applied ( electrocardiography , pulse oximetry , and non-invasive blood pressure monitor ) . An 18G-cannula will be inserted , and the patients will receive 10 mg metoclopramide , and 50 mg ranitidine . Baseline heart rate and systolic blood pressure will be recorded as the average of three consecutive readings with 2-minutes interval . Lactated Ringer 's solution will be infused at rate of 15 mL/Kg over 10 minutes as a co-load ; spinal anesthesia will be achieved by injecting 10 mg of hyperbaric bupivacaine and 20 mcg fentanyl into the subarachnoid space at L3-L4 or L4-L5 interspace using 25G spinal needle . After subarachnoid block , mothers will be placed in supine position with left-lateral tilt and the vasopressor infusion will be started . To maintain the double-blind scheme , the total dosage of epinephrine ( mcg ) for patients in each group will be calculated and added to the 50 ml syringe and will be infused at rate of 50 mL/hour . The calculated epinephrine dose will be withdrawn using insulin syringe .

Investigators will study both the side effects of the drug and assess if the drug will help patients recover more quickly and slow down the progression of acute respiratory failure .,"Soluble E-selectin is a significant biomarker for adult respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) . Soluble E-selectin also has pro-inflammatory properties further releasing cytokines and promoting its synthesis and the continued influx of neutrophils . Small molecule glycomimetic antagonists of E-selectin ( rivipansel and uproleselan ) are 500- to 1000-fold more potent inhibitors of E-selectin and have shown activity and no measurable toxicity in human clinical trials for other indications . Treatment with these E-selectin inhibitors reduced the levels of soluble E-selectin in the bloodstream which occurs during recovery of ARDS . Thus , antagonists of E-selectin which include glycomimetic antagonists and more specifically , rivipansel ( GMI-1070 ) and uproleselan ( GMI-1271 ) , may be used to treat COVID-19 patients with respiratory symptoms that may lead to ARDS Primary Objective : Safety of uproleselan in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia . Secondary Objectives : To evaluate if treatment with uproleselan administered intravenously in addition to the best available therapy according to institutional guidelines is able to reduce the progression of acute respiratory failure , in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia . To evaluate proportion of patients alive and free of respiratory failure through Day 28 To evaluate overall survival and all-cause mortality at day 15 and 28 .

Drugs will be prepared and delivered by another anesthesiologist outside of the research team . Subjects Following patient informed consent , 100 patients aged 18-65 years old , with American Society of Anesthesiologist ( ASA ) physical status I or II who underwent spinal anesthesia . The following groups of patients were excluded from the study : patients with a history of allergy to the drugs used in the study , pregnant patients , neuromuscular disease , hyperthyroid , severe cardiopulmonary diseases , liver and/or renal disorders , used drugs that could interact with MgSO4 such as nifedipine , and preoperative body temperature less than 36oC or more than 37.5oC . Patients were dropped out if : any complications such as systemic allergic reaction , anaphylaxis , cardiac arrest was occured , failure of spinal anesthesia , respinal , surgery duration less than 30 minutes , and conversion to general anesthesia during evaluation . Interventions and Outcomes After randomization , subjects would be given drugs according to their randomization group . MgSO4 30 mg/kg and meperidine 0.5 mg/kg were dissolved in 100 ml NaCl 0.9 % , and labeled as `` research drug '' for blinding . Drugs were given in 10 minutes while patients were monitored for side effects such as hypotension , bradycardia , nausea , vomiting , itch , allergy , drowsiness , and respiratory depression . If hypotension occurs or blood pressure decreases > 20 % from baseline , patients will be treated with a crystalloid solution and intravenous ephedrine 5-10 mg . Afterwards , patients were given 10 ml/kg crystalloid with room temperature 22oC - 23oC for 10 minutes before spinal anesthesia . Spinal anesthesia was performed at the lumbar vertebrae 3-4 or 4-5 interspaces , with 15 mg hyperbaric bupivacaine and fentanyl 25 mcg . Room temperature was maintained between 19oC - 24oC . Patients were covered with one layer of blanket , which covered the chest and upper arm , and other areas outside the operating area . Patients were given fluid maintenance of 2 ml/kg/hour crystalloid and oxygen supplementation 2-3 l/minute by nasal cannula . Patient ini this study also were managed in the state of Ramsay sedation scale 2 ( co-operative , oriented , and tranquil ) or 3 ( appears asleep , but responds to verbal command ) , so some patient were given midazolam intravenously to maintain the condition . The incidence of shivering , mean arterial pressure , heart rate , respiratory rate , and tympanic membrane temperature were observed every five minutes during the first 15 minutes and every 15 minutes within the next 120 minutes . The degree of shivering was measured with Crossley and Mahajan scale which is 0 = No shivering , 1 = piloerection or peripheral vasoconstriction , 2 = muscular activity in only 1 muscle group , 3 = muscular activity in more than 1 muscle group but not generalized , and 4 = intens shivering involving the whole body , except in the muscle affected by spinal block.6 Drugs were considered effective if they could prevent the incidence of 3rd or 4th degree shivering . Meperidine 25 mg intravenously was given if 3rd or 4th degree shivering occurred . Nausea and vomiting was treated by IV metoclopramide 10 mg. Postoperatively , all patients were transferred to recovery room and monitored for one hour until discharge . Statistical Analysis All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS ( Statistical Package for Social Sciences ) version 20.0 . Chi-square test or Fisher 's exact test were used to compare the difference of proportion in shivering between the two groups . For numerical data , T-test and Mann-Whitney test were used .

The study is also looking more closely at cellular , molecular and inflammatory properties of the aortic wall . Having the ability to identify markers that predict AAA progression/expansion and risk for rupture could allow the physician to manage patients in a more individualized , personal way .","Abdominal aortic aneurysm ( AAA ) is a life-threatening degenerative vascular disease characterized by transmural aortic macrophage infiltration , elastin degradation , and reduction of smooth muscle cell content . AAAs occurs later in life and are especially prevalent in men over the age of 65 . Patients typically remain asymptomatic until rupture , which is associated with high mortality . Currently , surgical repair is the only approach for AAA treatment , and there is no pharmacological intervention . Clinically , ultrasound and computed tomography measurement of aneurysm diameter represents the mainstay of management and the principal determinant of timing for elective surgical repair . However , this anatomy-based approach fails to provide useful information about the cellular and molecular processes associated with aneurysm expansion and rupture . Therefore , developing translatable molecular biomarkers , specifically expressed by aneurysms , is necessary to determine associated status and progression , capture the risk of rupture , and deliver personalized treatment .",2020-10-05,"April 9, 2022","Non-Aneurysmal Patients , ( Aim 2A , n=3 ) Inclusion Criteria : - Patients with aortoiliac occlusive disease causing lifestyle limiting claudication , rest pain , and/or tissue loss that requires aortofemoral bypass Exclusion Criteria : - Patients with aortoiliac occlusive disease , we will apply the same exclusion criteria as AAA patients .

The specific objective of this proposal is to determine whether pitolisant has effects on alcohol consumption and craving","The present proposal is intended to answer the call for accelerating drug development by exploring the potential of a novel anticonvulsant , Pitolisant as a candidate medication for the treatment of AUD . Pitolisant is an H-3 receptor inverse agonist that is FDA-approved for treating narcolepsy which has been found to have effects of on alcohol craving and consumption in preclinical studies . The aims of this study are to test the effects of Pitolisant on alcohol self-administration and craving among a sample of non-treatment seeking heavy drinkers . The effects of 5-days of pitolisant ( 8.9mg ) or placebo will be evaluated in a human laboratory using an alcohol self-administration methodology . In this within-subjects crossover design , heavy drinkers ( N=28 ) will be randomized to the order of exposure ( Pitolisant or placebo ) prior to completing two alcohol self-administration trials . Subjects will receive a priming drink of alcohol and will have access to 8 alcoholic drinks over a 2-hour period . The investigators anticipate that subjects will consume less alcohol during an alcohol self-administration trial when receiving Pitolisant compared to when they are receiving placebo . Significant Pitolisant-induced reductions in the quantity of alcohol self-administered will be considered to be an indication that this drug may have value as an AUD medication .

Tumor cells can easily invade the intrahepatic vasculature , especially the portal vein or hepatic venous system , and form portal vein tumor thrombus ( PVTT ) or hepatic vein tumor thrombus ( HVTT ) .PVTT/HVTT is one of the main adverse factors for the long-term survival of HCC . The location and scope of its occurrence are closely related to the prognosis , and it is also a main hindrance to the improvement of the overall curative effect of HCC in recent years . As the treatment of HCC converts to multi-disciplinary therapy , the neoadjuvant therapy will be commonly used in the treatment of HCC with PVTT.Early clinical data already support a safe combination of immune checkpoint inhibition with TACE .

Data from this study will contribute toward the development of improved treatment and prevention strategies to maximize the functioning and active healthspan of older adults with neuropsychiatric disorders .","Late-Life Depression [ LLD ] ) , is prevalent , disabling , and associated with high rates of completed suicide . Among the LLD patients at the highest risk of these adverse outcomes are those who manifest decreased processing speed and/or decreased gait speed . To develop urgently needed novel therapeutics for LLD , a reasonable approach is to target systems underlying the development and persistence of psychomotor slowing . One such approach has been to augment dopaminergic signaling since post-mortem experiments and in vivo neuroimaging studies have implicated age-related dopaminergic decline in the development of slowing . L-DOPA is the immediate precursor of dopamine , is converted to dopamine in presynaptic dopaminergic nerve terminals , and enhances dopaminergic transmission in multiple brain regions . As opposed to other dopaminergic interventions ( i.e. , dopamine receptor agonists and stimulants ) , a large literature shows beneficial effects of L-DOPA on cognitive performance and gait in patients with Parkinson 's disease , all while being a safe and well-tolerated medication that is difficult to differentiate from placebo in terms of side effects . A second therapeutic strategy that has been tested for LLD and is relevant to psychomotor slowing is aerobic exercise training . A number of reports and meta-analytic reviews suggest that exercise is an effective non-pharmacologic treatment for depression , including depression in older adults . The largest recent study found that progressive aerobic exercise conducted three times weekly for 30min over 24 weeks was effective for depression and was tolerated extremely well ( 14.3 % drop-out rate , 70 % intervention adherence ) . Exercise training may be effective for LLD by counteracting deleterious age-related changes related to its development and maintenance , such as by reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines , normalizing hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis hyperactivity , and decreasing physical disability and social isolation . Exercise also appears to facilitate adaptive neuroplastic changes in the hippocampus , prefrontal cortex ( PFC ) , and anterior cingulate cortex ( ACC ) as well as increased white matter connectivity . While both dopaminergic augmentation and exercise are promising interventions , neither treatment alone may be sufficient to address the serious adverse medical and psychiatric outcomes associated with LLD and psychomotor slowing . In our preliminary study ( NYSPI IRB # 7270 ) , L-DOPA was associated with significant improvements in gait speed , but the effect size of this improvement was only moderate ( d=0.4 ) . L-DOPA failed to increase average gait speed in this study above the 1m/s threshold associated with functional disability and increased mortality risk in epidemiologic samples . While exercise has not been studied specifically in this patient population , meta-analyses of exercise interventions in older adults suggest overall effects on gait speed are modest ( d=0.3 ) and perhaps not clinically significant . Thus , one goal of this study is to combine these interventions having complementary mechanisms of action to realize a greater therapeutic benefit . This study includes task-based functional MRI that will allow us to probe the differential therapeutic mechanisms of L-DOPA and exercise and further elucidate the nature of effort-based decision making and reward deficits in LLD . Decision making about voluntary behavior requires weighing the benefit of potential rewards against the effort cost required to achieve them . This calculation is performed by separable populations of dopaminergic midbrain neurons whose signals for value and effort are integrated with the ventral striatum ( VS ) . Anterior VS ( AVS ) consistently has been shown to encode subjective value , increasing with the probability of reward and decreasing with effort discounting , while recent work suggests dorsomedial VS ( dmVS ) activates during the initiation of effortful action . We hypothesize that older adults are biased toward inactivity ( and thereby at risk for depression ) on the basis of dopaminergic decline that diminishes subjective value estimates and increases the effort cost of action ( i.e. , by the development of slowing ) . Among PD patients , L-DOPA increases willingness to work independently of facilitating movement by increasing subjective value estimates . By increasing fitness and helping individuals learn about their increasing capacities , exercise may facilitate effort initiation . Below , we evaluate whether complementary effects on effortful behavior may be achievable via L-DOPA increasing subjective value and Exercise reducing effort cost .",2020-11-17,"January 18, 2023","Inclusion Criteria : Aged greater than or equal to 60 years Diagnostic and Statistical Manual ( DSM ) 5 MDD , Dysthymia , or Depression Not Otherwise Specified ( NOS ) Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression ( HRSD ) greater than or equal to 18 Decreased processing speed ( defined as 1 SD below age-adjusted norms on the Digit Symbol Test ) or decreased gait speed ( defined as average walking speed over 15 ' course less than 1m/s ) Willing to and capable of providing informed consent and complying with study procedures Exclusion Criteria : Substance abuse or dependence ( excluding Tobacco Use Disorder ) within the past 12 months History of psychosis , psychotic disorder , mania , or bipolar disorder Probable Alzheimer 's Disease , Vascular Dementia , or Parkinson 's disease Mini Mental Status Examination ( MMSE ) less than or equal to 24 HRSD suicide item greater than 2 or Clinical Global Impressions ( CGI ) Severity score of 7 at baseline Current or recent ( within the past 4 weeks ) treatment with antidepressants , antipsychotics , or mood stabilizers History of allergy , hypersensitivity reaction , or severe intolerance to levodopa/carbidopa Any physical or intellectual disability adversely affecting ability to complete assessments , including physical inability to perform treadmill testing and exercise protocol Acute , severe , or unstable medical or neurological illness Mobility limiting osteoarthritis of any lower extremity joints , symptomatic lumbar spine disease , history of joint replacement surgery , or history of spine surgery Contraindication to magnetic resonance imaging",1,0,60 Years,100 Years
