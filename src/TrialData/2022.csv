Rehman Medical Institute - RMI,NCT05348980,Intramuscular Phenylephrine HCL for Prevention of Spinal Anesthesia Induced Hypotension,Rehman Medical Institute - RMI,4,1,Hypotension,Drug,Phenylephrine Hydrochloride 4 mg,Prevention,Triple,"Background : Spinal anesthesia ( SA ) is preferred over general anesthesia in Cesarean section ( CS ) due to its better safety profile but SA induced hypotension remains a big challenge for the clinical Anesthetist . Different methods including 15° left lateral table tilt , leftward uterine manual displacement , fluid pre-and co-loading have been used but drop in Systolic Blood Pressure ( SBP ) jeopardizing maternal and fetal well-being still occurs . Timely administered Phenylephrine HCL , an α-1 adrenergic agonist , is a recommended remedy . Subjects and methods : Sixty parturients of American Society of Anaesthesiologists ( ASA ) physical status 1 and 2 , scheduled for elective CS under SA were enrolled in this prospective double-blinded study and randomly divided into two equal groups , P4 and P8 . They received intramuscular ( IM ) Phenylephrine HCL 04 mg and 08 mg respectively before SA . Spinal block up to T6 was achieved with 12.5 mg 0.5 % Bupivacaine HCl heavy . The incidence and intensity of hypotension , rescue doses of Phenylephrine HCL and any adverse event , were recorded . Data collected was analyzed using Epi lnfo ™ version 7.2 .","Introduction : World Health Organization ( WHO ) defines maternal death as a death while pregnant or within 42 days of the end of gestation , from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management ( excluding accidental or incidental causes ) . In 2017 global Maternal Mortality Ratio ( MMR ) reported by United Nations ( UN ) is 211 deaths per 100,000 live births . MMR in Pakistan , with inter-provincial variability , is 186 deaths per 100,000 live births according to the latest Pakistan Maternal Mortality Survey ( PMMS ) report published in August , 2020 by United Nations Population Fund ( UNFPA ) , a subsidiary organ of United Nations General Assembly . CS requires general anesthesia , SA or epidural anesthesia ; however , SA is preferred . SA is believed to be safe , though severe complications like profound hypotension compounded by aorto-caval compression might happen . World Health Organization ( WHO ) defines ideal CS rate below 10 to 15 % . According to 1990-91 and 2017-18 Pakistan Demographic and Health Survey data , rate of C-section has been raised from 3.2 % to 19.6 - 22.3 % . Higher rate of anesthesia and surgery in a developing country like Pakistan has a direct bearing on MMR , patient 's morbidity , cost of medical services and siphoning scarce resources . The first case of cardiac arrest occurring after SA was reported in 1940 and since then , the ability of SA to cause cardio-pulmonary arrest was considered . Hypotension and bradycardia are the most common side effects of SA . SA induced hypotension , which is a substantial clinical challenge , is caused by pharmacological sympathectomy . The incidence is reported around 80 % . Hypotension occurs despite fluid preload , left lateral uterine displacement and left lateral table tilt . Duration and severity of hypotension is responsible for maternal ill effects like nausea/vomiting initially and later culminating to dyspnoea , apnea and circulatory arrest if poorly managed . Additionally there will be poor apgar score or even fetal demise depending upon the severity . Energetic use of strong vasopressors has been recommended . Phenylephrine HCL is considered to be the vasopressor of choice in parturients due to its propensity to cause less fetal acidosis . Phenylephrine HCL being an α-1adrenergic agonist counters the decrease in Systemic Vascular Resistance ( SVR ) induced by SA and can be administered by subcutaneous , intravenous and IM routes . Its onset and duration of action are 1-3 minutes and 5- 20 minutes respectively , when given intravenously ( IV ) ; and 10-20 minutes and an hour respectively when given IM . Clinically , 50-100 microgram boluses of Phenylephrine HCL is used intravenously to address hypotension . The investigators , in the current study exploited its lesser reported IM route . Rationale : IM Phenylephrine HCL shortly before administering SA can prove a better option to prevent hypotension even for longer duration due to its slower absorption and can provide longer hemodynamic stability , lesser drop in fetal pH and apgar score . Objectives : The primary objective of the study was to determine appropriate dose of IM Phenylephrine HCL in preventing hypotension due to SA administered for CS in ASA 1 and 2 parturients . Secondary objectives were to determine the need for total rescue doses of Phenylephrine HCL , measure drop in SBP in the two trial groups ; and observe any side effects associated with IM injection of Phenylephrine HCL .",2022-04-04,"April 21, 2022","Inclusion Criteria : All pregnant ladies of American Society of Anesthesiologists ( ASA ) physical status 1 or 2 with Singleton Pregnancy , Full term pregnancy , and Admitted for elective CS Exclusion Criteria : All those participants having ; Blood pressure ≥140/90 mm of Hg , ASA 3 or above status , Contraindication to spinal anesthesia Fetal anomalies/ Abnormal placentae Refusal to consent",60,1,18 Years,45 Years

Biomass smoke associated COPD ( BS-COPD ) clinical spectrum is different to the one seen in tobacco smoke associated COPD ( TS-COPD ) . BS-COPD patients present COPD-asthma phenotype or asthma-COPD overlap syndrome ( ACOS ) , TS-COPD patients present mostly the emphysema phenotype . BS-COPD patients have a greater risk of exacerbations in comparison to the emphysema phenotype . Therefore , individualizing treatment in both phenotypes may be very useful among the clinical practitioners . The investigators expect treatment with FF/V to be superior in preventing COPD exacerbations than the U/V combination in patients with COPD-asthma phenotype ; andU/V to be superior than FF/V in patients with the emphysema phenotype . The general objective of the study is to determine the exacerbations outcome in patients with COPD-asthma vs emphysema phenotype patients , treated with both drugs . Secondary objectives include assessment of pulmonary function tests , quality of life , dyspnea and functional capacity change after a 24 weeks treatment .","Type and duration of the investigation : A randomized , blinded , controlled clinical trial ; longitudinal , prospective , 3 years ( Sep-2017 through Sep-2020 ) . Background : COPD associated to biomass smoke ( BS-COPD ) represents the third of all COPD cases in Latin America , and almost the 2 % in general population prevalence studies . BS-COPD clinical spectrum is different to the one seen in COPD associated to tobacco smoke ( TS-COPD ) . While BS-COPD patients present COPD-asthma phenotype or asthma-COPD overlap syndrome ( ACOS ) , TS-COPD patients present mostly the emphysema phenotype . COPD-asthma phenotype in BS-COPD , probably explains that they have a greater risk of exacerbations in comparison to the emphysema phenotype . Therefore , individualizing treatment in both phenotypes may be very useful among the clinical practitioners , because even though those patients are not included in traditional clinical trials , they are part of every day 's practice . In this sense , providing a specific treatment in this group of patients could change the disease progression , improving symptoms , quality of life , reducing costs , side effects and exacerbations . The investigators hypothesize that COPD-asthma phenotype or asthma-COPD overlap syndrome ( ACOS ) , may get a greater benefit by using a combination LABA/ICS ( Fluticasone Furoate/Vilanterol - FF/V ) therapy , whereas those with the emphysema phenotype with LABA/LAMA ( Umeclidinium/Vilanterol U/V ) therapy The upside of these drugs is that both of them have the same easy-to-use device , and it is inhaled once a day only . Their efficacy and safety have been tested in TS_COPD but not in BS-COPD . This trial will allow us to have a clinically and functionally characterization ( using biological markers ) of the BS-COPD phenotype and to compare those patients with those with the emphysema phenotype . Hypothesis : Treatment with FF/V will be superior in preventing COPD exacerbations than the U/V combination in patients with COPD-asthma phenotype ; while U/V will be superior than FF/V in patients with the emphysema phenotype . General objective : To determine the exacerbations outcome ( exacerbations free interval , exacerbations frequency , severe exacerbations that needed hospitalization frequency , exacerbations frequency according to absolute and percentage ( > 3 % ) blood eosinophils , exacerbations percentage for emphysema phenotype and COPD-asthma phenotype ) in patients with COPD-asthma vs emphysema phenotype patients , treated with Fluticasone Furoate/Vilanterol 100/25 mcg/day vs Umeclidinium/Vilanterol 55/25 mcg/day , after 6 months of treatment . Secondary objectives : To determine in both groups : ( 1 ) Pulmonary function change ( FEV1 , FVC and inspiratory capacity ) ( 2 ) Impulse oscillometry resistance change ( 3 ) FeNO change ( 5 ) Quality of life change ( CAT and Saint George ) ( 6 ) Dyspnea change ( mMRC , BDI y TDI ) ( 7 ) Functional capacity change ( 6MWT distance ) . ( 8 ) To characterize and establish the frequency of the COPD-asthma phenotype in BS-COPD patients and emphysema-phenotype in TS-COPD patients . Methods : Randomized double blind controlled clinical trial . Patients with at least one exacerbation in the last 12 months ( confirmed by the prescription of antibiotic and/or oral steroid ) , and a smoking index > 10 packs/year or a biomass smoke exposition index > 100 hours/year . One hundred BS-COPD patients and one hundred TS-COPD patients will be included ; both groups will be exposed to the two treatment options . Fifty patients from each group ( BS-COPD and TS-COPD ) will be assigned with FF/V and 50 from each group with U/V . Emphysema phenotype and air-trapping pattern will be determined with a CT image . All CTs will be assessed by a radiologist . Baseline DLco will also be correlated with the emphysema CT findings . Blood eosinophils , blood levels IgE , bronchodilator reversibility and baseline FeNO . Rate of exacerbations will be determined in both groups for a time period of 6 months . At the end of the study , the phenotype of each patient will be determined and treatment efficacy will be evaluated according to the phenotype . The sample size was chosen conventionally by considering that there are no other centers with a BS-COPD cohort . Treatment will be randomly assigned using a random numbers table . Safety evaluation includes severe adverse events ( SAE ) assessment ( mainly pneumonia ) . During the informed consent signing visit ( day -15 ) , BS-COPD or TS-COPD diagnosis will be confirmed . There will be four in-clinic visits ( baseline ; +30 days ; +90 days and +180 days ) where the symptoms diary will be evaluated to determine the rate of exacerbations or other health resources use . Also , pulmonary function tests ( spirometry pre and post-BD , IC ) and functional capacity tests ( 6MWT ) will be performed by each patient . Health related quality of life ( SGRQ and CAT ) and dyspnea ( mMRC and BDI/TDI ) questionnaires will also performed .

The intervention leveraged peer support , technology via WhatsApp Messenger , community health workers , peer educators and involvement of key community stakeholders to reduce prevalence of loneliness , depressive symptoms and common mental disorders , improve perceived social support , and develop coping , parenting , and communication skills to mitigate potential stressors and stigma of adolescent motherhood .","Adolescent mothers in Zimbabwe often experience stigma and feel isolated due to lack of social support with a loss of social networks and educational opportunities . Adolescent mothers may also lack coping skills and resources to successfully navigate motherhood . Unless addressed , these circumstances may have negative consequences for the mental health of the adolescent mother and downstream consequences for their children . A quasi-experimental design was used , and the research tested differential changes over base- , mid- , and end-line in mental health and social support outcomes among adolescent mothers ( 14-18 years ) in the intervention and control arms . The study addressed two objectives : Understand and describe perceptions and experiences with adolescent motherhood and their influence on health . Explore the acceptability and effectiveness of a community-based peer support intervention for adolescent mothers in a high-density low-income community in Harare to mitigate potential stressors and stigma of adolescent motherhood . Adolescent mothers engaged as active participants in the development ( e.g. , defining their needs ) and implementation of the intervention which also involved key community stakeholders to address stigma related to mental illness and adolescent motherhood . Existing community resources were leveraged such as peer support , health workers , and technology through WhatsApp Messenger , a popular and low-cost messaging app , to deliver some intervention components and as a platform for communication and training support for peer support group facilitators . Community health workers and peer educators in the intervention arm were recruited and trained on co-facilitating peer support groups .

( Control Group ) in patients undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass grafting surgery ( CABG ) at a tertiary care cardiac center of Karachi , Pakistan . STUDY DESIGN : Randomized control trial PLACE & DURATION OF STUDY : The research will be conducted in the Department of Anesthesia & Intensive Care , National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases ( NICVD ) , Karachi . 6 months ( 01/08/2021 to 31/1/2022 ) . DATA COLLECTION PROCEDURE : This study was conducted among 60 patients allocated randomly into two groups . In the study group ( group D ) , dexmedetomidine was given as an infusion of 0.4 μg/kg/h from induction of anesthesia for 24 hours . In the control group ( group C ) , the patients were receiving an equal volume of normal saline . PRIMARY OUTCOME : The primary outcome of the study was Serum Creatinine ( mg/dl ) which was measured before the surgery at baseline and then 48 hours after surgery . SECONDARY OUTCOMES : The secondary outcomes were incidence of urine output per hour for up to 48 hours after surgery , operative time from induction of anesthesia till skin closure , aortic cross-clamp time from application of aortic cross-clamping till aortic declamping , CPB time from connecting the patient to extracorporeal circulation till termination of CPB , duration of ICU stay from transferring the patient from the operating room to the ICU till patient discharge to the ward , episodes of bradycardia and hypotension , dosage of inotropics and hemoglobin levels at baseline and up to 48 hours . KEYWORDS : cardiac surgery-associated acute kidney injury , dexmedetomidine , serum creatinine .","INTRODUCTION : The incidence of cardiac surgery-associated acute kidney injury ( CSA-AKI ) varies from 5 to 42 % .1 This percentage was found to be 7.86 % according to study conducted in Pakistan . 2 Severe CSA-AKI is independently associated with three to eight-fold higher perioperative mortality , prolonged ICU and hospital length of stay , and increased cost of care.3 The etiology of renal injury is mainly due to elevation of renin levels as a result of sympathetic overactivity in addition to nephrotoxic inflammatory and hemodynamic components.4 The risk risk factors , even for those patients with complete renal recovery.3 As yet , there is no definite strategy for preventing AKI after cardiac surgery.5 Dexmedetomidine is a selective and potent α2-adrenoceptor agonist that is used for its anxiolytic , sedative , and analgesic properties.6 It decreases central nervous system sympathetic outflow in a dose-dependent manner and has opioid-sparing analgesic effects . There is increasing evidence of its organ-protective properties against ischemic and hypoxic injury , including cardioprotection , neuroprotection , and renoprotection.7,8 Peng et al . in his meta-analysis has highlighted the significant role of dexmedetomidine in reducing AKI after bypass surgeries.8 Then , R.Shi and H-T. Toe have also pointed out the promising renoprotective role of Dexmedetomidine in CABG surgeries . 10 Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes ( KDIGO ) is one of the latest classifications of identifying AKI and is commonly used in various studies . 11 In 2016 , Ammar AS et al . in their study documented the reno-protective role of peri-operative dexmedetomidine infusion in cardiac surgery.4 The aim of this study is to use infusion of dexmedetomidine for renal protection in cardiac surgeries . PATIENTS AND METHODS : The aim of this study was to compare the changes in serum creatinine and urine output up to 48 hours of surgery in patients receiving dexmedetomidine infusion in addition to standard protocol as compared to the patients receiving standard protocol alone , and see if dexmedetomidine infusion reduced the incidence of Acute Kidney Injury ( AKI ) in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery ( CABG ) in a tertiary cardiac center of Karachi , Pakistan . This study , a randomized control trial , was conducted in the Department of Anesthesia & Intensive Care , National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases ( NICVD ) , Karachi , for a period of 6 months ( 01/08/2021 to 31/1/2022 ) , after approval from the ethical review committee of NICVD , Karachi . Sample size for the study was calculated using G * Power version 3.1.9.2 using method of sample size calculation for two-sided hypothesis testing of two independent mean . Taking mean and standard deviation of serum creatinine after 48 hours of CABG in Dexmedetomidine and control group reported by Ammar AS et al . [ 3 ] , at 5 % level of significance and 90 % power of test , the minimum required sample size of n=6 patients in each group was calculated . Considering the design effect , a sample size of 30 patients in each group was decided . N = 60 = 30 ( control ) + 30 ( treatment ) . Patients aged between 18 and 65 years , undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass grafting , and having ASA physical status class IV were included in the study . All patients with preoperative renal impairment ( elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels ) , on diuretic use , preexisting hepatic or pulmonary disease , peripheral vascular disease , previous cardiac surgery , emergency surgery , reopening surgeries , surgeries requiring a deep hypothermic circulatory arrest , preoperative use of inotropes or vasopressors , perioperative use of diuretics , perioperative episode of CPR , preoperative hemoglobin level less than 12 mg/dl , hematological disorders and with morbid obesity were excluded . Preoperatively , careful assessment of the cardiovascular system and investigations for the exclusion criteria and routine investigations which included complete blood count , coagulation profile , liver , and renal function tests , blood grouping , chest radiography , ECG , and echocardiography was done . On the day of surgery in the Operation Theatre ( OT ) , wide bore intravenous cannula ( 16G ) was inserted . Midazolam ( 0.01-0.02 mg/kg ) was given as premedication . Arterial cannulation was applied under local anesthesia in the radial artery . In the operative room , pulse oximeter ( SpO2 ) , a five-lead ECG , and invasive arterial blood pressure monitoring was applied . Doses of induction was adjusted according to the hemodynamics and myocardial function of the patient . Anesthesia was induced by propofol ( 1-5 mg/kg ) in addition to nalbuphine ( 0.1-0.2 mg/kg ) and atracurium ( 0.6 mg/kg ) . After preoxygenation for 3 min and finally , a suitable-sized endotracheal tube was inserted , and the patient was connected to IPPV . Anesthesia was maintained with an inhalational agent ( isoflurane ) ( 1-2 % ) in 100 % oxygen with the intent to maintain the mean arterial blood pressure and heart rate within 20 % of the baseline . Atracurium will be administered , at a dose of 0.1-0.2 mg/kg to maintain muscle relaxation throughout the procedure . We divided a total of 60 patients after informed and written consent , in to two groups using computer generated random allocation based on Bernoulli distribution with probability of success ( allocation of treatment group ) as 0.50 . In Dexmedetomidine Group ( Group D ) , patients received Dexmedetomidine infusion in addition to standard management protocol ( 0.4 μg/kg/h from induction of anesthesia till the end of surgery ) . Whereas , in Control Group ( Group C ) patients allocated to this group will receive standard management protocol alone . We have used Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes ( KDIGO ) protocol in order to evaluate incidence of acute kidney injury . This protocol defines acute kidney injury as increase in serum creatinine more than 0.3mg/dl within 48 hours OR urine volume of less than 0.5ml/kg/hr for 6 hours . 12 After induction of anesthesia , central venous line , urinary catheter , and temperature probe was inserted . Before skin incision additional nalbuphine was injected . Arterial blood gases , serum Na and K , hematocrit , and blood glucose was measured after induction of anesthesia , during CPB , after weaning from CPB and according to needs . Activated clotting time was measured at baseline , 3 min after heparin administration , during CPB , and finally after reversal of heparin with protamine sulfate . The primary outcome of the study was Serum Creatinine ( mg/dl ) which was measured before the surgery at baseline and then 48 hours after surgery . The secondary outcomes were incidence of urine output per hour for up to 48 hours after surgery , operative time from induction of anesthesia till skin closure , aortic cross-clamp time from application of aortic cross-clamping till aortic declamping , CPB time from connecting the patient to extracorporeal circulation till termination of CPB , duration of ICU stay from transferring the patient from the operating room to the ICU till patient discharge to the ward , episodes of bradycardia and hypotension , dosage of inotropics and hemoglobin levels at baseline and then up to 48 hours . . Hypotension was defined as decrease in systolic blood pressure < 90mmHg.12 Bradycardia was defined as heart rate less than 60 beats/min . 12 The staff involved in the clinical care and members of the study group obtaining the data were blinded to randomization for the period of data achievement and analysis . Group allocation was revealed after the final statistical analysis . Data was analyzed using IBM SPSS version 21 , data was summarized by computing descriptive statistics such as mean ± SD for continuous response variables ( including serum creatinine ( ng/dL ) , urine output , and creatinine clearance ) and frequency ( % ) for categorical response variables . Treatment and control group was compared for baseline characteristics and outcomes by conducting Chi-square test ( for categorical variables ) and independent sample t-test ( for continuous response variables ) . Relative risk ( 95 % CI ) of AKI and other adverse outcomes were computed for treatment groups . Two-sided p-value of ≤ 0.05 was taken as criteria for statistical significance .",2022-04-30,"May 11, 2022","Inclusion Criteria : Ages ranged between 18 and 65 years .

University of Montana,NCT05226299,Cough Desensitization Therapy: Pilot 2,University of Montana,1,1,Cough,Biological,Supra-threshold and progressive doses of diluted capsaicin via a dosimeter-controlled nebulizer,Treatment,Single,"The purpose of this study is to investigate a modified behavioral treatment for chronic cough due to cough hypersensitivity syndrome ( CHS ) . This type of CC is a non-productive cough that is due , in part , to over-expression of transient receptor potential vanilliod ( TRPV ) receptors in the airway epithelium , which contribute to a dry cough elicited by typically non-tussive stimuli ( e.g. , cold air , smells ) or by low doses of tussive stimuli ( e.g. , smoke ) . Currently available treatment options are limited to neuromodulator medications ( e.g. , gabapentin , amytriptiline ) and behavioral cough suppression therapy ( BCST ) , neither of which is 100 % effective . The primary component of BCST is teaching patients to suppress their cough in the presence of an urge-to-cough . Studies have confirmed a reduction in cough sensitivity ( as tested with inhaled capsaicin ) following 1-4 weeks of successful cough suppression . However , patients with severe CHS are not able to suppress their cough in the presence of uncontrollable environmental stimuli and , hence , do not respond well to the therapy . The purpose of this study is to determine the potential of treating CHS by implementing BCST while stimulating cough with progressive concentrations of inhaled diluted aerosolized capsaicin . The investigators hypothesize this treatment will result in a reduction in cough-reflex sensitivity , cough-related quality of life , and cough frequency .","The study will be a randomized , placebo-controlled , blinded study . It will take place in three phases , across 10 weeks . WEEK 1 : BASELINE TESTING AND TRAINING ( approximate time = 1 hour ) . Cough sensitivity testing : Standardized procedures that have been established and approved by the FDA will be used to determine cough sensitivity . Participants will inhale capsaicin vapor ( a known cough stimulant ) through a nebulizer with dosimeter , that delivers a specific dose of capsaicin in a mist form . They will inhale doubling doses of capsaicin mist from .49 micromolar to 1000 micromolar .

"University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill",NCT05405244,Examination of Bromocriptine on Homeostatic and Hedonic Mechanisms of Food Intake in Individuals at High Risk for T2DM,"University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill",3,1,Overweight and Obesity,Drug,Placebo,Diagnostic,Triple,"The current project applies an integrative three-prong approach to investigate the potential of the dopamine D2 receptor ( DRD2 ) agonist bromocriptine to : 1 ) increase homeostatic satiation signaling , 2 ) alter neural circuitry to reduce hedonically motivated food intake , and 3 ) examines a genetic predisposition that may markedly impact the effectiveness of this medication in those at high risk for T2DM .","Twenty-nine million Americans have diagnosed type 2 diabetes ( T2DM ) , with fewer than half able to meet treatment goals and considerably more are at risk for development of T2DM . Implementation of healthy eating behavior has been identified as a barrier to T2DM treatment and efficacy . The determinants of eating behavior and weight regulation involve a complex interaction among individual-level homeostatic , hedonic , and genetic systems , and the external food environment . The high prevalence of obesity and T2DM suggests hedonic motivation to consume food overrides homeostatic satiation signaling , resulting in excess food intake . Elevated intake increases body mass and promotes T2DM incidence via dysregulation of glucagon-like peptide 1 ( GLP-1 ) , amylin , and adiponectin , which in turn can negatively impact T2DM treatment options . Use of a pharmaceutical , such as bromocriptine , to aid in behavioral change is a novel method for treating and ameliorating T2DM and warrants investigation given that previous work has shown reward response to food images mediates T2DM control . Use of functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) techniques to predict and evaluate hedonically-motivated eating behavior can be used to measure sensitivity to reward , and the role it plays in developing obesity , and is therefore an excellent tool to examine the associations among bromocriptine , satiety hormones , reward sensitivity and eating behavior . Moreover , since 20-35 % of the population carries the DRD2 TaqIA A1 allele , and 65 % of the population is overweight or obese and at high risk for T2DM development or currently diagnosed , as much as 23 % of the population may greatly benefit from dopamine agonist treatment . Despite the possibility that bromocriptine may have robust impact on T2DM treatment or as prevention therapy in those that are genetically predisposed , few data are available that directly examine the three systems ( homeostatic , hedonic , genetic ) available to assess whether a genetically-informed , personalized T2DM treatment is viable .",2022-05-31,"August 12, 2022","Inclusion Criteria : Baseline BMI between 25 and 35 Exclusion Criteria : Individuals with current fMRI contraindications ( e.g. , metal implants , braces ) Probable current Axis I psychopathology ( e.g. , major depression disorder , panic disorder , generalized anxiety disorder , bipolar disorder ) Habitual use of cigarettes or illicit drugs Pregnancy or breastfeeding Diagnosis of serious medical problems ( e.g. , diabetes , cardiovascular disease , stroke ) Current weight loss dieting and/or weight fluctuations great than 10 lbs in the previous 6 weeks Do not consume dairy Allergy to bromocriptine , dairy , and nuts",55,0,18 Years,35 Years

H1 : There is a difference in blood glucose AUC ( 0-60 min ) between glucose and ENSO 16 . Sample size calculation No formal sample size calculation could be performed for this trial as ENSO 16 has never been tested on glucose metabolism parameters in a clinical trial . There is evidence that sugar substitutes have to be studied separately because sweeteners differ considerably in their chemical structure and their physiologic effect on glucose metabolism . However , based on a cross-over trial with the sugar substitute xylitol at high doses , a sample size of 12 was appropriate to detect significant differences in outcome parameters . Based on these study results and on available statistical recommendations , a sample size of 15 was chosen , which is considered to be appropriate for this cross over trial to detect significant differences in the main outcome parameters if present .

With itch representing the most burdensome symptom in eczema , the main objectives with the lotion is fast and efficient itch relief , high tolerability , and high short- and long term safety . This phase 1 study aims to monitor skin tolerability , and how much of the active compound that is absorbed to the bloodstream .","Fexofenadine Hydrochloride Topical Lotion 1 % ( OP2101 ) is a novel formulation developed for the treatment of skin disorders characterized by pruritus . Research show that oral Fexofenadine Hydrochloride ( FX ) may lead to a small improvement of pruritus in patients with Atopic Dermatitis ( AD ) . In clinical practice , oral antihistamines are widely used off-label for pruritus relief in AD , indicating a discrepancy in trial outcomes and real-life experience . The pre-study thesis postulates that the antipruritic effect of FX can be leveraged in a dose-response relationship facilitated by high topical concentration of FX in direct contact with the pathological process of the skin . The sponsor also suggest that the Cytosolic phospholipase A2 ( cPLA2 ) blocking property of FX is an untapped resource that is likely to be dose-response dependent and manifested by means of high topical concentration in proximity to the inflammatory process . The repositioning of FX to a topical treatment has the potential for high safety , efficacy , fast relief , and ease of use . OP2101 is also aimed at inflammation control , suppression of bacterial imbalance , moisture retention , upregulation of antimicrobial peptides , and skin barrier restoration . As such , it targets six of the pathological pillars of AD .

However , some difficulties are encountered during the removal of caries due to the structural features of primary molars and the young age of the child . Therefore , in the treatment of primary molars , Atraumatic Restorative Treatment ( ART ) , in which the soft parts of the carious lesion are cleaned with the help of a sharp hand tool and restored with an adhesive glass ionomer cement ( GIC ) that releases fluoride , in the following years , the deciduous teeth were removed with a minimally invasive approach . Hall technique , in which a stainless steel crown ( SSC ) is placed without preparation for treatment , has come to the fore .","Many restorative materials , especially GIC , have been used for ART procedures , and with the advancing technology , high-viscosity glass ionomer cements with improved mechanical and chemical properties have emerged . In recent years , zinc-added HVGICs and nano-filled resin-modified HVGICs have been introduced . The Hall Technique has been suggested in the treatment of asymptomatic decayed primary molars in anxious and fearful patients to ensure patient cooperation . In this technique , it is aimed to stop the progression of caries by covering the carious deciduous molars with SSC and cutting their relationship with the oral environment , without the need for local anesthesia and tooth preparation . Thus , as the bacteria can not use the carbohydrates in the oral environment , the number of bacteria in the environment will also decrease .",2022-07-04,"July 13, 2022","Inclusion Criteria : children with no systemic disease , children who had a Frankl Behavioral Scale score 2 , children who have no occlusal problems or bad habits , children presenting between 2-5 caries lesion in primary molars .

Ketamine ( a competitive NMDA receptor antagonist ) plays a role in thermoregulation at various levels and ketamine , has been shown to inhibit postoperative shivering in some reports and studies .","Spinal anaesthesia is a safe and popular anaesthetic technique for various surgeries . Around 40-60 % of the patients under spinal anaesthesia develop shivering.The main causes of shivering intra and postoperatively are temperature loss , decreased sympathetic tone and systemic release of pyrogens . Hypothermia during neuraxial anesthesia develops initially from core to peripheral redistribution of body heat . Redistribution of body heat during spinal or epidural anesthesia typically decreases core body temperature 0.5-1.0 degree Celsius . Shivering is characterised by involuntary oscillatory contractions of skeletal muscles . Once the body is exposed to cold , it is a physiological response for heat preservation after peripheral vasoconstriction . Postoperative shivering is defined as the fasciculation of the face , jaw or head or muscle hyperactivity , lasting longer than 15 seconds . It is a common and challenging aspect of anaesthesia and targeted temperature modulation because it leads to increase oxygen consumption and increases the risk of hypoxia . The most frequent complication in postoperative period is shivering which is reported to be between 20-70 % after general anaesthesia . The incidence reported in previous studies are 5-65 % after general anaesthesia and 30-33 % after epidural procedures . The overall shivering incidence in a recent meta-analysis was 34 % . The underlying pathology of shivering is not fully understood yet , therefore the definitive treatment and prevention has not been established till date . Due to its importance as postoperative complication and the lack of available data about aetiology and treatment , this narrative review of the published literature on this topic is essential . Various pharmacological agents being used for prophylaxis and treatment of post spinal shivering are Opioids like fentanyl , tramadol , pethidine , Anticholinergics like physostigmine , NMDA receptor antagonist like ketamine and the latest being alpha-2 antagonists like clonidine , dexmedetomidine . Recently , ketamine and dexmedetomidine have been used to prevent shivering during anaesthesia , with good results . Ketamine ( a competitive NMDA receptor antagonist ) plays a role in thermoregulation at various levels and ketamine , has been shown to inhibit postoperative shivering in some reports and studies . Dexmedetomidine , a centrally acting alpha 2-adrenergic agonist , has been used as a sedative agent and is known to reduce the shivering threshold . Dexmedetomidine also provided sedation which is sufficient to prevent the anxiety without any adverse effects . And until date , there are limited studies using dexmedetomidine in the treatment of postoperative shivering . A very limited data is available on this subject in our Pakistani population . Pethidine is drug of choice for the prevention and treatment of shivering . Due to the non-availability of Pethidine , doctors are looking for newer and better options . Considering this , a study is designed to compare between Dexmedetomidine and Ketamine , as they are easily available and very few studies are done till date comparing them , as ketamine is n't researched much as an anti-shivering agent as it is known for undesirable side effects like delirium and hallucinations and dexmedetomidine being a newer agent . Results of this study will help to select the better prophylactic option for prevention of shivering after spinal anaesthesia in our general population .",2022-10-22,"February 6, 2023",Inclusion Criteria : Patients aged 20-50 years .

Chang Gung Memorial Hospital,NCT05663827,Ruxolitinib as add-on Therapy in Steroid-refractory Graft-vs-host Disease,Yi-Lun Wang,3,1,Steroid Refractory GVHD,Drug,Ruxolitinib,Treatment,,Steroid-refractory graft-vs-host disease ( SR-GVHD ) is a major cause of mortality after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) . We sought to evaluate the effect and safety of ruxolitinib ( RUX ) add-on in the treatment of patients with SR-GVHD .,"Nowadays , second-line treatment for SR-GVHD differs between centers and depends on the physician 's experience . The agents commonly used as second and further lines of therapy include anti-thymocyte globulin , mycophenolate mofetil , calcineurin inhibitor , or extracorporeal photopheresis . However , the response varied . This study highlighted that corticosteroid ( CS ) is not a panacea for treating GVHD , and some patients with remission still experience further relapse . Additionally , the identification of multiple infections adds complexity . Hope was supposed to come in 2019 after the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) approved RUX for the therapy of SR-GVHD in adult and pediatric patients > 12 years . RUX add-on should be withheld as the risks outweigh the benefits , especially for patients who developed scleroderma and bronchiolitis obliterans . RUX can be added on as needed for the treatment of GVHD , especially in patients receiving DLI as relapse therapy with the conversion from mixed chimerism to complete chimerism . Despite some studies showing the efficacy of RUX across affected organs , some other data bring the opposite results . Thus we conducted this study to reinforce the efficacy of RUX as an add-on therapy for SR-GVHD .",2022-11-23,"December 15, 2022",Inclusion Criteria : Patients diagnosed with hematologic disorder Exclusion Criteria : Those who are not applicable of receiving Ruxolitinib as immunodeficiency-modulation therapy Those who are actively encountering acute infectious illness,6,0,3 Months,30 Years

Prisma Health-Midlands,NCT05281562,Immunonutrition for Diabetic Foot Ulcers,Prisma Health-Midlands,2,0,Diabetes Mellitus,Drug,Lovaza,Treatment,,"Diabetes-induced peripheral neuropathy can lead to the development of diabetic foot ulcers ( DFUs ) , which can have a devastating effect on patients ' lives and can lead to life threatening infection , amputations , and even death . Conventional treatment of DFUs are time consuming , burdensome , costly , and often do not treat the root cause of the problem . Even with proper care , ulcers can take a significantly longer time to heal in diabetic patients due to the altered physiology which does not allow for the proper nutrients and healing factors to mobilize to the site of injury , leaving these ulcers with a poor chance of healing and at high risk for infection and possible amputation . Supplemental immunonutrition therapy may offer a viable , low cost , rapidly scalable , and widely available approach to enhance the body 's ability to heal itself . This prospective , randomized pilot study will evaluate the effect of a 6-week daily oral course of a specific combination of immunonutrients , L-Arginine , Omega-3 fatty acids , and Vitamin C , on wound healing in diabetic patients with chronic lower extremity ulcers compared to traditional standard of care . The deliverables of this clinical project will serve to advance a cost-effective added strategy to address a significant unmet clinical need in treatment for the diabetic patient population . Study outcomes will lay the foundation for a multi-site clinical trial to establish the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of this strategy across the health care system .","Diabetes mellitus is one of the most prevalent chronic diseases in the world and its incidence is expected to increase over the next 20 years . Historically there are three described types of diabetes mellitus : Type 1 , Type 2 , and Gestational . The etiology of disease may vary between types , and our current understanding notes overlap of these types , yet the resulting pathophysiology is the same : poor peripheral blood flow , decreased cellular response at the injury site , elevated glucose levels , and poor nutrient transport . Despite many of these patients having an elevated Body Mass Index ( BMI ) , they are functionally under or malnourished . In addition , some patients develop progressive neurologic dysfunction , called peripheral neuropathy ( PN ) . A common complication of diabetes induced PN is the development of diabetic foot ulcers ( DFUs ) , which can have a devastating effect on patients ' lives and can lead to life threatening infection , amputations , and even death . Conventional treatment of DFUs includes shoe wear modification , self-monitoring , local wound care , brace and shoe offloading , and surgical intervention as well as more sophisticated treatments such as bioengineered cellular technologies and hyperbaric oxygen therapy . These modalities are time consuming , burdensome , costly , and often do not treat the root cause of the problem . Additionally , even with proper care , ulcers can take a significantly longer time to heal in diabetic patients due to the altered physiology which does not allow for the proper nutrients and healing factors to mobilize to the site of injury , leaving these ulcers with a poor chance of healing and at high risk for infection and possible amputation . In contrast to traditional treatment modalities , nutrition therapy has been shown to aide in healing of chronic wounds by providing essential nutrients which were not previously present in necessary amounts in diabetic patients . Nutrition therapy has proven useful in modulating inflammation and the immune response , optimizing glucose control , and attenuating the hypermetabolic response to ulcers , ultimately improving healing and recovery . Thus , supplemental immunonutrition therapy may offer a viable , low cost , rapidly scalable , and widely available approach to enhance the body 's ability to heal itself . This prospective , randomized pilot study will evaluate the effect of a 6-week daily oral course of a specific combination of immunonutrients , L-Arginine , Omega-3 fatty acids , and Vitamin C , on wound healing in diabetic patients with chronic lower extremity ulcers compared to traditional standard of care . Wound characteristics and clinical photographs will be documented throughout the course of the study . Patient-reported pain scores , side effects , and unscheduled visits to emergency departments/urgent care centers will be recorded . Patients randomized to receive immunonutrition supplementation will complete an additional survey detailing their satisfaction with the treatment plan upon completion of their participation in the study . The deliverables of this clinical project will serve to advance a cost-effective added strategy to address a significant unmet clinical need in treatment for the diabetic patient population .

Approval was obtained from the institutional review board of BSMMU for this clinical trial ( Reference No : BSMMU/2018/25 , dated 01/01/2018 ) . Impacts of a single intra-articular ( IA ) injection of autologous adipose tissue derived total-stromal-cells ( TOST ) containing mesenchymal stem cells on pain , physical function , stiffness , and cartilage thickness assessed and compared before and after intervention . Patients satisfied the American College of Rheumatology ( ACR ) criteria for osteoarthritis ( OA ) knee included in the study . Kellgren-Lawrence ( KL ) radiological scores were used to define OA grade ; however , high-frequency musculoskeletal ultrasonogram ( MSUS ) was used to measure cartilage thickness . There is no standard protocol to follow while assessing cartilage thickness ; however , recent work of Podlipska and co-workers would be a worth consideration for using adipose tissue for cartilage regeneration . As medial tibio-femoral joint is the most commonly involved in KOA , here , we consider medial femoral cartilage thickness . The assessment used a commercially available ultrasound device ( Samsung Accuvix , 2010 , origin- South Korea ) with a 15 megahertz linear transducer ML6-15 . The patient was positioned supine with the knee in full flexion . A proximal-distal probe sweeping over the anterior-central knee area , medial femoral articular cartilage imaged in an axial plane . Degenerated cartilage signified either loss of surface sharpness or increased inner echogenicity ; local or total thinning of articular cartilage . The definitions for articular cartilage degeneration are as follows : Grade 0 - a monotonous anechoic band with sharp hyperechoic anterior and posterior interfaces , Grade 1 - loss of the average sharpness of cartilage interfaces and or increased echogenicity of the cartilage , Grade 2a - grade 1 plus thinning of articular cartilage less than 50 % , Grade 2b - more than 50 % but less than 100 % thinning of articular cartilage , Grade 3 -100 % local loss of the cartilage tissue . A total of thirty KOA was randomly divided into two groups - case and control .

Vaginal Biome Science,NCT05390606,Effects of Flourish HEC and BioGenesis to Improve Conception,Vaginal Biome Science,1,0,Infertility,Combination Product,Flourish HEC and BioGenesis,Other,,This study intends to address whether improving the vaginal microbiome can help couples increase chances of conceiving .,"Disrupted vaginal microbiomes are associated with a number of poor reproductive outcomes , including infertility , miscarriage , premature rupture of membranes , preterm labor and delivery , delivery of a low birthweight baby , and maternal infections ( chorioamnionitis , endometritis ) . A healthy vaginal microbiome is typically thought to be one that is dominated by one of several Lactobacillus species , such as L. crispatus , L. gasseri , or L. jensenii . Several studies have shown that non-lactobacilli-dominant biomes are associated with poor in vitro fertilization or intrauterine insemination outcomes . Fewer studies have examined fertility in the home setting , and none to date has asked whether improving the vaginal microbiome ( VMB ) could increase fertility . This study addresses both . By assessing the VMB before and after using a vaginal care system which supports a healthy VMB , we will be able to examine whether there are associations between VMB composition and infertility , and whether shifting the VMB toward a lactobacillus-dominant state is able to improve chances of conception . In this study , women will either follow routine care ( control ) or routine care plus the vaginal care system and fertility lubricant ( intervention ) for 3 months or until becoming pregnant , whichever comes first . In addition to tracking conception rates during those 3 months , we will follow women for an additional year following completion of the 3-month timeframe . If any woman is pregnant at the one-year mark , her pregnancy will be followed until delivery ( or early termination ) to track delivery outcomes and adverse events .",2022-05-18,"July 17, 2023","Inclusion Criteria : Women part of a cisgender couple aged 18 to 40 who are attempting to become pregnant and are attending a fertility clinic .
