The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio,NCT02504931,Serotonin Selective Reuptake Inhibitor Treatment of Dual Diagnosis Post-traumatic Stress Disorder and Alcohol Problems,The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio,4,1,PTSD,Drug,Sertraline,Treatment,Triple,"The investigators propose to conduct a clinical trial to evaluate sertraline treatment efficacy in a large sample of military veterans with a dual diagnosis of PTSD and Alcohol Use Disorder who are receiving Cognitive and Behavioral Therapy as part of the VA-system 's new dual diagnosis program . The study is designed as an efficacy trial of sertraline used as an adjunct to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy ( CBT ) in the treatment of PTSD/Alcohol dual diagnosis . There are two outcomes of interest , namely PTSD symptom improvement and also decreased alcohol consumption . The investigators are interested to know whether or not sertraline is superior to placebo in improving the symptoms of either one or both of these two disorders . Even though sertraline is a treatment of choice for PTSD , the investigators expect that the comorbid condition of alcohol dependence will complicate the treatment of PTSD and that the clustered subgroups will show differential treatment response with sertraline . The primary objective of the present study is to identify subgroups of alcohol dependent persons with PTSD who will either benefit or not benefit from treatment with SSRI 's . The proposed study will enroll veterans with PTSD and dually-diagnosed alcohol dependence in a 12-week treatment providing sertraline vs. placebo medication as an adjunct to manualized CBT and will specifically test the hypothesis that subtypes of alcohol dependence can be used to predict which patients respond well and which subgroup responds poorly to SSRI treatment .","Experimental Design . The study design is a parallel group , double-blind , placebo-controlled , stratified , randomized medication treatment trial of male and female veterans who experienced `` in-theater '' trauma and have both a PTSD and Alcohol Use dual diagnosis . All subjects will receive 12 weeks of manualized cognitive & behavioral therapy as a standard of care . Additionally , subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive double-blind treatment with Sertraline vs . Placebo as an adjunctive treatment . The manualized therapy provides standard cognitive-behavioral therapy ( CBT ) addressing alcohol use and prolonged exposure ( PE ) behavioral therapy targeting PTSD . Sertraline is a common treatment for PTSD and psychiatric disturbance but is hypothesized to have differential efficacy in different subtypes of alcohol drinking patients . A stratified randomization scheme will balance placebo and sertraline assignment to two groups , and a post-hoc clustering approach will be used to determine which subgroups of dual diagnosis patients may benefit from sertraline vs. placebo treatment . Veterans with PTSD who regularly drink more than 5 standard drinks of alcohol in a day ( note one 12oz beer = one standard drink ) may be eligible for the study if they meet criteria .",2013-07-16,"March 13, 2018","Inclusion Criteria : 21-65 year old Veterans with PTSD who regularly drink more than 5 standard drinks of alcohol in a day who experienced a trauma during deployment and who regularly drink more than 5 standard drinks alcohol and are interested in coming in once per week for 12 weeks of dual diagnosis individual therapy and are willing to participate in a placebo-controlled trial which could include receipt of sertraline ( Zoloft ) .

There is a need for more data on telaprevir drug interactions with other antidepressants . For a number of reasons , paroxetine may be a good candidate for use together with telaprevir-containing HCV treatment . The interaction between paroxetine and telaprevir has not been studied before .","HCV infected patients are often in need for an antidepressant . Inadequate treatment of depression during HCV treatment has a negative effect on adherence to HCV treatment , with suboptimal response as a potential result . The introduction of Direct Acting Antivirals such as telaprevir has greatly improved treatment outcome of HCV infected patients . Telaprevir , however , causes some significant drug-drug interactions and hence co-administration of other medications should preferably only be done based on clinical evidence that such a combination is safe . Telaprevir has been studied with one antidepressant , escitalopram : plasma concentrations of the antidepressant were reduced by 35 % and without dose adjustment this may lead to inadequate treatment of depressive symptoms . Dose titration of escitalopram may be needed but it may take several weeks before a patient has reached a therapeutic dose . There is a need for more data on telaprevir drug interactions with other antidepressants . First , the data above show that a negative interaction occurs with escitalopram and dose-titration of the antidepressant may take too long to prevent the ( re- ) occurrence of depressive symptoms . Second , not all patients benefit from escitalopram and those with ( prior ) treatment failure on escitalopram may require an alternative agent . Third , although escitalopram is generally well-tolerated , side effects may occur and necessitate treatment discontinuation . Finally , especially in the previous intravenous drug users on methadone , escitalopram might not be the antidepressant of choice , since escitalopram as well as methadone are drugs that can lead to QTc interval prolongation and have a risk of Torsades de Pointes . For a number of reasons , paroxetine may be a good candidate for use together with telaprevir-containing HCV treatment . First , paroxetine has been shown to prevent depressive symptoms in patients initiating HCV treatment with elevated depressive symptoms at baseline . Second , paroxetine is an inhibitor of and is metabolized by CYP2D6 while telaprevir is an inhibitor of and is metabolized by CYP3A , and therefore no drug-drug interaction is expected . Third , paroxetine is one of the most widely prescribed antidepressants with a well-established efficacy and safety profile .",2013-04-02,"December 4, 2020","Inclusion Criteria : Subject is at least 18 and not older than 65 years at screening .

GWI refers to a complex of symptoms that typically include widespread chronic pain , persistent headache , memory and concentration problems , gastrointestinal difficulties , sleep disturbances and unexplained fatigue . This symptom profile is similar to that of fibromyalgia syndrome ( FMS ) , a multi-symptom condition similar to GWI . Whereas , effective treatments for GWI have yet to be found , progress has been made in identifying medications to treat FMS .

Compared to placebo ( PBO ) Duloxetine ( a serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor ) and Pregabalin ( an alpha-2-alpha-subunit calcium-channel ligand ) significantly improved pain responses and fatigue . The capacity of Duloxetine to increase central levels of serotonin and norepinephrine as well as the more complex alterations of neurotransmitters and central nervous system ( CNS ) mediators of pain attributed to pregabalin are thought to be responsible for the medication 's effects on pain , mood and sleep . Clinical practice and one open-label trial support the use of these medications in combination to achieve optimal symptom improvement amongst GWI sufferers ; however , such combinations have not been formally tested in randomized controlled trials .

Egg Oral Immunotherapy for inducing sustained unresponsiveness to egg exposure in children .,"Food allergy affects 6-8 percent of children in the United States . In young children , reactions to egg can range from hives to severe life threatening allergic reactions called anaphylaxis . Current treatment for food allergy is complete avoidance of the food and to carry antihistamines and self-injectable epinephrine if an accidental reaction occurs . However , accidental exposure to allergens in processed foods may be difficult to avoid . Currently , several therapeutic strategies are being investigated to prevent and treat food allergies . Since immunotherapy injections for food allergy are associated with a high rate of allergic reactions , alternate approaches to treatment are needed . Oral ( by mouth ) immunotherapy ( OIT ) is one approach that has been tried in some studies in the treatment of food allergies . The purpose of this study is to compare baked foods with egg versus ( vs. ) egg OIT . The intent of the study is to investigate if participants will be able to consume egg after taking baked foods with egg or egg OIT for a period of time and then stopping for a certain period . This is referred to as tolerance or sustained unresponsiveness . This study will evaluate the effectiveness of the egg OIT vs. baked egg by having each participant ingest egg white solid or baked foods with egg . This will be done over 2 years .

A group of medicines used to treat diabetes , glucagon-like-peptide-1 analogues ( GLP-1 ) , may be able to protect people with diabetes from DKD by reducing inflammation in the kidney . This study aims to test this theory by studying the effect of GLP-1 on kidney function in people with diabetes . To understand how GLP-1 can affect inflammation , the investigators will give a GLP-1 treatment ( Liraglutide ) to people with DKD and monitor the effect on inflammation and kidney function using blood and urine tests . The investigators will compare these results to patients with DKD who do not receive GLP-1 treatment . If GLP-1 proves to be effective in reducing inflammation and improving kidney function , then it could be developed as a viable new treatment for people with DKD , and may significantly reduce the disease burden , or the risk of DKD , in people with diabetes .

In addition , the study will compare the immunogenicity and safety of IPV when administered via different routes . A total of 1504 healthy infants between the ages of nine to ten months , who have completed their primary immunizations , including at least three doses of trivalent Oral Polio Vaccine ( tOPV ) will be recruited for this study .","In studies conducted to date , Inactivated Polio Vaccine ( IPV ) appears to boost the systemic immunity generated by Oral Polio Vaccine ( OPV ) priming significantly more effectively than the use of additional doses of OPV . The use of IPV to both enhance the immunity generated by OPV and also to provide protection against circulating Vaccine Derived Polio Virus type 2 outbreaks and Vaccine Associated Paralytic Poliomyelitis has the potential to address concerns regarding a switch to bivalent OPV . Concomitant administration with Expanded Program of Immunisations ( EPI ) vaccines given at about nine months would be a feasible programmatic approach . Maternal antibodies will have largely waned by this point negating any inhibitory effect which they may have within the priming schedule . Significant interference between IPV , Measles and Rubella ( MR ) and Yellow Fever ( YF ) vaccines must be excluded to ensure that IPV introduction does not negatively impact on the immunogenicity or safety of the other vaccines in the program at the same point . Restricted manufacturing capacity in the context of a higher manufacturing cost than OPV would currently limit the rate at which IPV could be rolled out within a modified EPI schedule . The administration of a fractional dose of the vaccine by the Intradermal route would facilitate vaccine role out through limiting the cost and the manufacturing scale-up required .

University of Edinburgh,NCT01845337,Study to Compare Cardiovascular Side Effects of Teysuno Versus Capecitabine,University of Edinburgh,2,1,Gastrointestinal Cancer,Drug,Teysuno,Treatment,Double,"Capecitabine is a chemotherapy drug used to treat many types of cancer including bowel and stomach cancer . Unfortunately a side effect of this drug is that it causes heart problems including heart attacks . An alternative drug , called teysuno is used extensively in other countries instead of capecitabine and appears to have less of a bad effect on the heart whilst still killing cancer cells . This study will investigate the effect of these two drugs on the heart and blood vessels and will be the first of its kind in humans .","Fluoropyrimidines ( FPs ) are widely used chemotherapy agents for the management of patients with colorectal , breast , upper gastrointestinal , head and neck cancers . Capecitabine is an oral prodrug of 5-fluorouracil ( 5FU ) which is used extensively in the UK but is associated with clinically overt cardiotoxicity in up to 9 % of patients . Cardiotoxicity occurs more commonly in patients with cardiovascular disease and manifests as chest pain , myocardial infarction , congestive heart failure , or sudden death with a mortality as high as 30 % . In a study of continuous ECG Holter monitoring in patients receiving 5FU infusion , the majority ( 68 % ) of patients had ischaemic ECG changes and 2 patients died suddenly . We conducted a national survey of UK oncologists and 60 % felt that 5FU/capecitabine cardiotoxicity was a significant problem in their clinical practice . Hypotheses for this toxicity include ischaemia secondary to coronary artery spasm , direct endothelial cell toxicity , myocardial toxicity and interactions with the coagulation system . Studies implicate a catabolite of 5FU , in particular fluoro-alanine ( FBAL ) . FBAL is further metabolized to fluoroacetate ( FAC ) , a cardiac toxin that inhibits mitochondrial aconitase , resulting in cell death .

Centre Jean Perrin,NCT01842698,Ultrasound-guided PVB,Centre Jean Perrin,2,0,Thoracotomy Surgery,Device,ultrasoundguided paravertebral catheter,Treatment,,"Thoracotomy , is a surgical procedure performed routinely in connection with pulmonary surgery . Pain induced by thoracotomy is considered as the most severe post-operative pain . Control of the pain is essential in the perioperative management . Nowadays , there are several strategies to support this pain , including regional anesthesia techniques in the context of multimodal analgesia . Epidural analgesia reduces pain scores and respiratory complications significantly . ParaVertebral Block ( PVB ) is a technique as effective as epidural analgesia in the treatment of pain after thoracotomy and could present a more limited number of complications . However , there is no consensus on the best technique for realisation of PVB . Para-vertebral catheterisation can be performed by posterior approach in seeking a strength loss after bone contact of transverse vertebral process using the technique of Eason and Wyatt , but it is a blind technique . The ultrasonographic control , developed in the context of all puncture invasive actions , is an effective contribution to the realisation of a BPV , but still insufficiently validated . First used to measure the distance skin - posterior costo-transverse ligament and skin - parietal pleura before procedure , the ultrasonography has recently led to the publication of echo-guided techniques combining recognition of structures defining the space para- vertebral , viewing the progression of the needle and the spread of the local anesthetic . The handling of the ultrasonographic probe associated with the puncture requires additional learning . The objective of this project is to study the feasibility of para-vertebral catheter insertion under ultrasonographic control . The appearance like `` pigtail '' of the catheter , the most recently proposed , seems the more attractive in terms of safety . The aim of this pilot prospective study is accurately quantify all qualitative parameters related to the technique in order to achieve a future validation with a medico-economic component . Ultrasound-guided technique will correspond to a technique with a puncture of the lateral to medial space described by Shibata , after spotting of the first rib proposed by Bouzinac .

Follow-up will be more intensive for the first 50 cases , and will transition to follow-up at two visits ( 7 and 42 days ) for the remaining 450 cases .","The World Health Organization , the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS ( UNAIDS ) , and other global reproductive health organizations have recognized the protective effect of male circumcision in HIV acquisition . Male Circumcision ( MC ) is one of the few biomedical methods to demonstrate consistent effectiveness as an HIV prevention intervention in randomized controlled trials ( WHO and UNAIDS , 2007 ) : three randomized controlled trials ( RCTs ) in Kenya , Uganda , and South Africa reported a protective effect up to 60 % of circumcision against HIV infection . Subsequent studies have confirmed the value and persistence of MC 's protection against HIV infection and have demonstrated that MC also reduces the acquisition and transmission of human papillomavirus . A wide variety of instruments , devices , and techniques are used around the world for male circumcision . In 2008 , WHO , UNAIDS and JHPIEGO released a draft document entitled Manual for Male Circumcision under Local Anesthesia , which includes step-by-step instructions for performing adult male circumcision using three different surgical procedures : the forceps-guided , dorsal slit , and sleeve resection methods . Procedure times for these techniques are approximately 20-30 minutes excluding anesthesia , involve control of bleeding and considerable suturing , and can be associated with a variety of complications . Demand for MC , even in non-circumcising communities , is substantial when offered at no cost in a safe setting ( WHO and UNAIDS , 2007 ) . In most African settings , only surgical circumcision is available for most adults . This is a prospective observational study of the PrePex device , which will be conducted with the aim of ascertaining moderate and severe adverse events . This study will be conducted within the context of routine service delivery in Lusaka , Zambia to identify potential issues that must be addressed as MC services are scaled up .

More recently , the spreader flap technique has been espoused as an alternative to spreader grafting . Herein we evaluated the efficacy of this technique in a randomized trial setting .","Rhinoplasty is a common facial plastic surgery procedure , one complication of which is nasal vault narrowing and consequent nasal obstruction . Recently , researchers have paid much attention to nasal valve area and especially to the role of upper lateral cartilage ( ULC ) in preserving of nasal patency , since a possible consequence of destructive techniques was permanent functional problems for patients . In addition to functional problems , it can cause some aesthetic problems such as the inverted-V deformity . Accordingly , reconstruction of the midvault after dorsal reduction has been advocated and widely adopted . The gold standard for midvault reconstruction after dorsal reduction has been the spreader graft , first advocated by Sheen . Subsequently , its usage has been widened to include repair of the valve in the unoperated nose , and its efficacy well-documented . However , it can be a time-consuming procedure that requires the harvest of septal cartilage . Therefore , some authors proposed the spreader flap as an alternative technique . While the results of the above mentioned articles proposed the efficacy of spreader flaps , none of them was a randomized trial and subjective methods were used for measurement of nasal breathing after rhinoplasty . Nasal obstruction can be evaluated in different methods , both quantitative and subjective , the validity of each debated . For example , while the numeric form of Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) is commonly used , it is ultimately related to patients ' subjective perception . Alternatively , objective evaluation of nasal patency is also of common interest to many researchers , and various methods for objective measurement exist . Among these different methods , acoustic rhinomanometry is an effective tool . However , some researchers debate the reliability of these results .

This study is designed to test that hypothesis by measuring the effect of hypoxia and exercise on forearm blood flow before and after depletion of SNO-Hb using oral N-acetylcysteine .","NO has been shown to associate with erythrocytes in the form of SNO-Hb and can deliver vasomotor changes as erythrocytes pass through a physiologic O2 gradient . The aim of this study is to transiently deplete circulating SNO-Hb levels to prove that these levels are directly linked with the normal physiological vasodilation that occurs in response to brief hypoxia that occurs in moderate exercise . This study will be performed on healthy volunteers especially with no predisposing cardiovascular or respiratory conditions that may change their vasomotor response to hypoxia . Systemic blood flow will be approximated using non-invasive forearm venous occlusion plethysmography which will be performed initial to gather baseline data . The participants will then undergo 4 days of 600 mg BID oral N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) solution treatment which acts as a bait reactant for NO groups bound to hemoglobin ( SNO-Hb ) and will then undergo retesting with forearm plethysmography . At the time of both blood flow measurements , arterial blood samples will also be gathered via an arterial catheter inserted on each of two testing days to determine SNO-Hb levels .

Sheikh Zayed Federal Postgraduate Medical Institute,NCT01902095,Clinical Effects of Tooth Powder on Gingivitis,Sheikh Zayed Federal Postgraduate Medical Institute,2,1,Gingivitis,Device,Tooth powder,Prevention,Single,"Dental plaque , known as dental biofilm , is implicated as the primary etiological agent responsible for oral inflammatory diseases . Matured form of dental plaque plays a major role in the pathogenicity of gingivitis ; if not managed in early stages it results in a cascade of events leading to the destruction of periodontal tissues . Effective plaque control techniques have been suggested that maintain dental biofilm at levels compatible with oral health and is the cornerstone for all preventive strategies to control oral diseases particularly gingivitis . To clean teeth and ensure effective plaque control , different mechanical means have been in use since centuries . However because of an inadequacy in plaque removal , different antimicrobial and antiplaque agents have been introduced in oral-care products . The use of dentifrices has been recommended over the years as the ultimate way of preventing the incidence of oral diseases . Dentifrices have the anti-plaque and the anti-gingivitis capabilities due to their composition . Toothpastes and to a lesser extent toothpowders are common oral-care products used to eliminate plaque and other deposits from tooth surfaces . Existent literature has focused more on toothpaste and mouth rinse and derelicts toothpowder despite its difference owing to the absence of humectants . With the intention to advance the knowledge on this issue as well as close the research gap , this study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of toothpowder in alleviating gingivitis , controlling dental plaque , and inhibiting extrinsic stains . A single-blind , parallel arm randomized controlled trial ( RCT ) evaluated the efficacy of toothpowder against toothpaste through oral hygiene parameters of plaque and stain deposits on teeth and gingival inflammation . Plaque Index , Lobene Stain Index and Gingival Index were used as measures of oral hygiene . The current RCT revealed that toothpowder and toothpaste were equally effective in both treatment and control groups from clinical perspective however toothpowder showed a statistically significant effectiveness as compared to toothpaste . Toothpowder , composed of calcium carbonate and essential oils , has demonstrated to be statistically more effective than toothpaste in controlling extrinsic dental staining , dental plaque and gingival inflammation .","A single-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted during November 2010 and October 2011 . After screening and consent , eligible subjects received mechanical periodontal therapy . Subjects were then randomized to Test group and Control group at a 1:1 ratio . The test group was provided tooth powder and a control group received toothpaste . Healthy subjects with plaque induced gingivitis and who fulfilled the inclusion criteria were recruited from the Department of Periodontology , Fatima Jinnah Dental College Hospital , Karachi , Pakistan.77 subjects with gingivitis were randomized to test group and 77 subjects to the control group . Therefore , to complete the randomized controlled trial , a total of 154 subjects were recruited and randomized . Outcome measure gingivitis was measured through plaque index , gingival index and Lobene stain index .",2013-05-09,"July 17, 2013","Inclusion Criteria Male or female Age ≥ 18-to-65 years ( 18th birthday completed ) In good general health Available for the duration of the study Able and willing to follow study protocol Able and willing to sign approved informed consent At least 20 natural teeth suitable for evaluation Full mouth Gingival Index ( GI ) score ≥ 1.04 Exclusion Criteria Females disagree to birth control measure for the duration of the study Having any acute /chronic systemic illness Current smokers or tobacco users Pregnant or lactating Females Allergy to the ingredients of the products to be tested Requiring pre-medication prior to dental appointment Antibiotic use in the last 3 months Routine use of anticoagulant medication Routine use of anti-inflammatory medication Routine use of medications known to have effects on the gingiva e.g. , phenytoin etc ) Routine use of medications inhibiting or stimulating salivary flow Physical handicap that could interfere with daily performance of oral hygiene Participation in any other study during the study period of this trial Routine use of any mouthrinse Routine use of any interdental cleaning device ( floss , dental toothpicks ) Having any removable appliance Having fixed orthodontic appliances ( including permanent orthodontic retainers ) Having probing depth ≥4 mm at any site Having had active periodontal therapy during the last 6 months Had periodontal prophylaxis or periodontal maintenance therapy in the last 3 months More than 3 carious lesions requiring immediate care Gross oral pathology ( e.g. , tumors , candidiasis , mucocutaneous disease )",154,0,33 Years,40 Years
McMaster University,NCT01908751,Fixation Using Alternative Implants for the Treatment of Hip Fractures (FAITH-2),McMaster University,3,0,Femoral Neck Fractures,Procedure,Sliding Hip Screw,Treatment,Quadruple,The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of surgical fixation ( cancellous screws versus sliding hip screws ) and biologic intervention ( Vitamin D versus placebo ) on patient important outcomes .,"Femoral neck fractures are a type of hip fracture associated with high complication rates and poor functional outcomes . It is estimated that over 300,000 hip fractures occur in patients under age 50 annually . Hip fractures in younger aged patients are particularly devastating with profound impairments of quality of life and function . Virtually all patients require surgical repair of their fractures and unlike elderly hip fractures , failure of surgery offers few options for salvage . Arthroplasty is a successful treatment for elderly patients ; however , a hip replacement is not a viable option for younger patients because of their higher functional demands for work and recreational activities that are not tolerated by joint replacements . There is more than one way to perform internal fixation for femoral neck fractures . Cancellous screws have traditionally been the preferred internal fixation implant for femoral neck fractures . Multiple screws ( 2 or more ) are used during fixation , and advocates of this implant promote the construct 's superior torsional stability , limited disruption of femoral head blood supply , minimally invasive insertion , and retention of more viable bone than the larger sliding hip screw ( SHS ) . On the other hand , sliding hip screws have been gaining popularity and there is evidence to suggest that SHS provide greater fracture stability and may reduce patient complications . It is currently unknown which method of internal fixation provides the best outcomes for patients . Femoral neck fracture treatment is further complicated by vitamin D insufficiency in as many as 8 of 10 trauma patients . Vitamin D plays an important role in musculoskeletal health and bone quality because it regulates serum calcium homeostasis . Laboratory research and human clinical studies suggest important associations between vitamin D , musculoskeletal health , and improved fracture healing . Experimental animal studies have demonstrated the concentration of vitamin D metabolites are higher at a fracture callus compared to the uninjured contralateral bone , vitamin D supplementation leads to decreased time to fracture union and increased callus vascularity , and vitamin D increases mechanical bone strength compared to controls . Clinical studies have also demonstrated that vitamin D supplementation increases the callus volume of proximal humerus fractures , increases the number and diameter of type II muscle fibres , and can improve wound healing , however , the effects of vitamin D supplementation in you patients with femoral neck fractures are unknown . Using a 2x2 factorial design , participant will be randomly allocated to one of four treatment arms . Participants allocated to the cancellous screw group will receive multiple threaded screws ( with a minimum of 3 screws and a minimum diameter of 6.5 mm ) and those allocated to the sliding hip screw group will receive a single larger diameter partially threaded screw affixed to the proximal femur with a sideplate using a minimum of 2 screws for fixation . Participants allocated to the vitamin D Group will receive a bottle of 2,000 International Units ( IU ) vitamin D3 drops . Participants will be instructed to take two drops daily for six months , for a total daily dose of 4,000 IU . Participants in the placebo group will receive an identical bottle of placebo drops with no active ingredient . Similarly , they will be instructed to take two drops daily for six months .

To achieve this muscle relaxation , neuromuscular transmission blocking agents , such as rocuronium ( Esmeron® ) are used . It sometimes happens that there is still some neuromuscular blocking activity left in the patient on awakening from anesthesia . This is called residual curarization and is known to cause postoperative complications such as impairment of respiratory function . Sugammadex ( Bridion® ) is a novel drug which selectively binds rocuronium ( Esmeron® ) . It allows for reversing of neuromuscular transmission blocking activity . Until now , all studies with sugammadex were performed in non-obese patients . Obese patient have a high risk to suffer from post-operative respiratory failure . Therefore it is vital to avoid residual curarization . Sugammadex might be an important factor . Obese patients have a large total body weight different from ideal body weight . Recent research demonstrated that the dose for the neuromuscular blocking agent rocuronium ( Esmeron® ) needs to be calculated on the patients ' Ideal Body Weight rather than on Total Body Weight . At this moment no data is available on the dose-response relationship of sugammadex in morbidly obese patients .

A number of existing medications currently used in other medical or psychiatric conditions have been considered , however , none of them has yet shown unequivocal signs of effectiveness for these problems in schizophrenia . One important reason for this , that has not been properly tested , is how antipsychotic treatment may affect the impact of these newer medications for cognition . In the present study , the investigators will evaluate how two different antipsychotic medications may have a different impact on the brain processes that give rise to important cognitive functions that are impaired in schizophrenia . They will conduct functional MRI in schizophrenia patients while they perform a cognitive task , both before and after 8 weeks of treatment with either aripiprazole or risperidone . Then the investigators will evaluate the effects of a new medication called modafinil , and how it may improve brain and cognitive function , depending on which antipsychotic medication the patients are taking .

A research pharmacist will randomly assign treatment ( without stratification ) , and package ARI and RIS in identical-appearing capsules . A blinded clinician will measure symptoms within 3 days before antipsychotic initiation and weekly thereafter ; adjust doses based on weekly evaluations of symptoms and side effects , and evaluate treatment adherence and substance use . The diagnostician , pharmacist and treating psychiatrist are otherwise uninvolved in the study . Low-dose benztropine ( ≤2 mg daily ) , lorazepam ( ≤1 mg daily ) and antidepressant treatment will be permitted , but not adrenergic agents or anticonvulsants . Initiation , stepped , and maximal antipsychotic doses will respectively be : ARI ( 7.5 , 7.5 and 30 mg , daily ) ; RIS ( 2 , 2 and 8 mg daily ) . If patients do not tolerate the treatment ( at the minimal dose ) , or exhibit treatment-refractory symptoms ( at the highest tolerated dose ) , they will discontinue the study , the blind broken , and transition into naturalistic treatment in the clinic . Receptor antagonist loads ( daily dose X Haldol equivalent ) will be computed for patients at unblinding , using indices for α2 and α1 receptors , D2 and muscarinic receptors . In the last half of the 8th week of antipsychotic treatment , subjects will undergo fMRI on two days , separated by one day for modafinil washout . They will receive modafinil ( 200 mg po ) on one day and Placebo on the other ( double-blind , counterbalanced ) , each in mid-morning , and scan 3-4 hours later , during the average peak plasma levels of modafinil 30 . All subjects will provide informed consent for all procedures , approved by the UCSF IRB . This study will meet the CONSORT standard for clinical trial design , conduct and reporting . functional MRI . 3 Tesla Siemens Timm Trio with 8 channel coil will be used for event-related fMRI , with single-shot , T2 * -weighted sequence , ( TR 2000 ms , TE 30 ms , flip angle 90° , FOV 220 x 220 mm , 36 contiguous axial oblique slices , 3.4 mm isotropic voxels ) . A structural MRI ( MP-RAGE ) will be acquired for normalization of EPI images . Pre-processing will include spatial realignment , slice timing correction , spatial normalization to T1 template , 8mm smoothing kernel . The GLM will be used with HRF convolved with a series of delta functions , and regressors for Task events , for each combination of Modafinil and Placebo and either Cue or Target . Errors/no-response trials are modeled separately . The functional connectivity analysis will use an LC-seeded beta series method ; each event modeled uniquely and the time series of betas ( segregated by task/treatment condition ) correlated with the seed at every voxel . The LC will be localized in EPI images with a mask in MNI space , derived from voxels meeting these criteria : A ) located in rostrodorsal pons , adjacent to 4th ventricle/sylvian aqueduct , restricted to an anatomically-defined dorsal pontine mask ( e.g. , not extending rostrally into the mesencephalon or superiorly into the 4th ventricle ; and B ) showing significant association with in-scanner pupil diameter , using this as a parametric regressor in GLM of BOLD time series , in an independent , healthy sample without treatment . Specific Aim 1 . To test whether aripiprazole preserves LC , PFC and cognitive control function to a greater degree than risperidone in schizophrenia outpatients . Hypothesis 1 . ARI group will exhibit greater task-related PFC activity and LC-PFC connectivity than RIS group , after 8 weeks of antipsychotic treatment : ( post-antipsychotic Placebo ) vs. ( pre-antipsychotic Baseline ) . Specific Aim 2A . To test whether aripiprazole is superior to risperidone in permitting modafinil enhancement of LC and PFC activity and cognition . Hypothesis 2A . The ARI group , vs. RIS group , will exhibit 2A ) greater effects of Modafinil ( vs . Placebo ) on task-related LC activity and greater cognitive control task improvement . Specific Aim 2B . To test the role of α2 autoreceptor antagonism by antipsychotic medications as a source of blunted LC response to Modafinil . Hypothesis 2B . Across groups ( ARI+RIS ) , α2 autoreceptor antagonist load correlates with impaired Modafinil effects ( vs . Placebo ) on task-related LC activity and cognitive control performance . These aims are related but not interdependent : antipsychotic effects on LC/PFC/cognitive function , vs. antipsychotic effects in moderating modafinil actions on these same measures , represent distinct research questions . Hypothesis 1 will be tested with the contrast indicated as per the Aim 1 Prediction in the table above . This is analogous to a directional test of the Group-by-Time-by-Task interaction . Hypothesis 2A will be tested as per the Aim 2 Prediction in the table . We predict that ARI treatment supports greater task-related Modafinil effects on LC activity , vs. RIS treatment . Hypothesis 2B will be tested across all patients by correlating α2 load ( by antipsychotics ) with mean task-related LC betas from the Treatment X Task Condition contrast . Significance for all analyses is set at p < .05 , FDR-corrected , or using the LC as SVC , as appropriate . Accuracy and RT cost will be tested by ANOVA .",2013-07-29,"April 17, 2020","Inclusion Criteria : less than 40 years old ; currently meet criteria for schizophrenia , schizophreniform disorder or schizoaffective disorder from the DSM-IV-TR ; require new or changed treatment with antipsychotic medication .

"University of Colorado, Denver",NCT01916577,Autologous CD117+ Progenitor Cell Mobilization for Lung Transplantation,"University of Colorado, Denver",1,1,COPD,Drug,Plerixafor mobilization of autologous CD117 stem cells,Treatment,,The purpose of this study is to determine if the drug Plerixafor ( Mozobil ) can lead to clinically relevant efflux of CD117+ stem cells from the bone marrow to the peripheral blood of normal controls and patients awaiting lung transplantation . The investigator 's hypothesis is that Plerixafor ( Mozobil ) will lead to significant mobilization of CD117+ stem cells to the peripheral blood .,"The investigators have developed a new therapy utilizing a stem cell found in the bone marrow that is defined by cell surface expression of the protein `` cluster of differentiation antigen 117 '' ( CD117 ) . Studies utilizing these stem cells in a mouse heart transplant model have demonstrated significantly improved survival of transplanted hearts , ( as much as more than 5 times that seen with untreated heart transplants ) . In vitro studies in mice also show that these cells work to inhibit the immune system by inhibiting T cell activation/proliferation by both paracrine ( primary ) and contact-dependent ( lesser ) mechanisms . Importantly , these stem cells are taken from the intended transplant recipient ( autologous ) and since these cells are part of their own body normally ( in small numbers ) ; these cells are theoretically without risk to the patient . This is very different from other stem cell therapies , which are taken from the donor and as such put the patient at significant risk of developing potentially life-threatening immune reactions . Because the use of our own stem cells is potentially safe - the rapid study , development , and implementation of autologous CD117 stem cell ( SC ) therapy in human transplant patients is theoretically possible . Therefore , these cells have high impact potential for the field of tissue and organ transplantation as well as auto-immunity - to potentially improve tissue/cellular engraftment , decrease acute rejection , and/or to promote organ transplant tolerance ( lack of rejection despite no concomitant immune-suppression ) . Prior to full clinical development ( efficacy trials in humans ) , the next step is to develop a safe and efficacious means for obtaining relatively large quantities of these cells from potential human recipients . As bone marrow biopsy for cell capture is not without risk ( especially to ill potential lung transplant recipients ) , the investigators propose to use Plerixafor ( Mozobil ) , a CXC-chemokine receptor 4 ( CXCR4 ) -inhibitor to cause efflux of bone marrow-derived CD117+ cells to the peripheral blood for capture by apheresis/positive selection . If successful , the next step will be to perform initial safety studies in human patients awaiting transplantation and normal controls ( not a goal of this initial protocol however ) . These studies have the potential to lead to large-scale clinical efficacy trials and ultimate indication/implementation for human disease ( s ) . Primary Outcome Measure : The number of circulating CD117+ cells per milliliter ( ml ) of peripheral blood at baseline and following Plerixafor ( Mozobil ) treatment ( change in peripheral blood CD117+ cells per ml ) . Secondary Outcome Measures : i . ) The number of Plerixafor ( Mozobil ) related adverse events ( AEs ) . ii . ) The number of patients with Plerixafor ( Mozobil ) related AEs iii . ) The number of Plerixafor ( Mozobil ) related serious adverse events ( SAEs ) . iv . ) The number of patients with Plerixafor ( Mozobil ) related serious adverse events ( SAEs ) . As listed in the package insert , the most common adverse reactions ( ≥10 % ) during hematopoietic stem cell mobilization were : diarrhea ( 37 % ) , nausea ( 34 % ) , fatigue ( 27 % ) , injection site reaction ( 34 % ) , headache ( 22 % ) , arthralgia ( 13 % ) , dizziness ( 11 % ) , and vomiting ( 10 % ) . It should be noted that the majority of these occurred in patients also undergoing apheresis . Outcome Measure Time Frame : Primary Outcome Measure Time Frame : At baseline and at 8 hours post-Plerixafor ( Mozobil ) treatment Secondary Outcome Measures Time Frame : i . ) : Continuously for the first 30 minutes post-Plerixafor ( Mozobil ) treatment , at 1 week post-Plerixafor ( Mozobil ) treatment , and up to 1 year post treatment . ii . ) : For the first 30 minutes post administration , at 1 week post-Plerixafor ( Mozobil ) treatment and up to 1 year post treatment , at 1 week post-Plerixafor ( Mozobil ) treatment , and up to 1 year post treatment . iii . ) : For the first 30 minutes post administration , at 1 week post-Plerixafor ( Mozobil ) treatment and up to 1 year post treatment , at 1 week post-Plerixafor ( Mozobil ) treatment , and up to 1 year post treatment . iv . ) : For the first 30 minutes post administration , at 1 week post-Plerixafor ( Mozobil ) treatment and up to 1 year post treatment , at 1 week post-Plerixafor ( Mozobil ) treatment , and up to 1 year post treatment . Primary Study Goals : To determine whether Plerixafor ( Mozobil ) will mobilize CD117+ progenitor cells from the bone marrow in patients with chronic lung diseases on the lung transplant waiting list ( versus normal controls ) . We will compare baseline counts of CD117+ cells with cell counts 8 hrs after Plerixafor to determine the efficacy of mobilization . The primary results will be used to determine the number of rounds of apheresis that may be required to isolate sufficient cells for reinfusion at later timepoints in a future study . Significance : If the investigators can mobilize a sufficient number of autologous CD117+ cells , they will eventually re-infuse them at the time of transplant to determine whether we can abrogate acute rejection following human lung transplantation ( future study ) . The investigators believe these are safer than allogeneic stem cells as there is no risk for graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) with autologous cells . Hypothesis : These experiments should demonstrate the effectiveness of CD117+ stem cell mobilization from the bone marrow to the peripheral blood ( PB ) via CXCR4 antagonism ( Plerixafor ) and whether end-stage lung disease affects the ability to mobilize stem cells . Additionally , these results will be used to mathematically extrapolate approximately how many rounds of peripheral blood apheresis will be required to attain adequate stem cell numbers for clinical infusion ( 10e7 ) for a future study . Methods : Experiments will involve taking blood from consented patients awaiting lung transplantation ( as well as normal controls ) prior to Plerixafor ( Mozobil ) treatment ( 240mcg/kg subcutaneously ) and then 8 hours after treatment as in Table 1 .

Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University,NCT01914601,King Vision and Cervical Spines Movement,Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University,2,1,Need Tracheal Intubation,Device,Macintosh-King Vision,Prevention,Single,"Extensive cervical spines movement during endotracheal intubation can result in serious neurological injury , especially in the patients with unrecognized cervical spines injury . [ 1-2 ] Moreover , direct laryngoscopy may be difficult if spine movement is limited because of arthritis , disc disease or a small gap between the occiput and the spinous process of the atlas . [ 3-4 ] Video laryngoscopes allow for intubation without alignment of the oral , pharyngeal , and tracheal axes which minimize the cervical movements , especially in the patients with restricted cervical movements . [ 5,6 ] Compared with the Macintosh laryngoscope , the use of AirWay Scope decreases median upper cervical-spine movement during intubation under in-line stabilization in patients with normal cervical-spine . [ 6 ] Unfortunately , the use video laryngoscopes are associated with longer times to tracheal intubation compared with the traditional techniques which may be attributed to the variable learning curves of the practitioners . [ 7-9 ] The King Vision video laryngoscope® ( King Systems Company , a division of Consort Medical , Indianapolis , Indiana , USA ) is an anatomically shaped , rigid laryngoscope that uses fiberoptic technology to view the larynx with micro camera offers a 160 degree of view potentially eliminating the need for neck flexion and head extension . [ 10 ] To the best of the authors ' knowledge , there is no study has evaluated the King vision laryngoscope regarding the neck movement during routine tracheal intubation under general anesthesia .","Hypothesis : The investigators hypothesize that the use of King Vision video laryngoscope may reduce the cervical spines movements during endotracheal intubation compared with the Macintosh laryngoscope . Aim of the study : The present clinical trial aims to compare the effects of the Macintosh and King Vision laryngoscopes , on cervical spines movement , time to intubation , laryngoscopic view , ease of intubation , number of intubation attempts , and number of optimization maneuvers during tracheal intubation , in the patients undergoing minor elective surgery under propofol-remifentanil-rocuronium anesthesia . Methods : Thirty two ASA I-II patients who need tracheal intubation will be included in this randomized cross-over controlled blind comparative study at the author 's center after obtaining approval of the local Ethical Committee and an informed written consent from all participants . The Mallampati airway score , thyromental and sternomental distances , neck extension , and the degree of mouth opening will be evaluated preoperatively as factors predicting difficult intubation . Sample size calculation : A priori power analysis of the previous published data [ 9 ] showed that the investigators will need to study 14 pairs to detect a 10 % difference in the cervical spine extension ( occiput-C5 ) values ( 25.9 degrees ) with a SD of 2.8 degrees , after intubation with of Macintosh laryngoscope , a type-I error of 0.05 and a power of 90 % . The investigators will add 10 % more patients for a final sample size of 32 patients to account for patients dropping out during the study . Anesthesia : Patients will be placed on the operating room table with a rigid board from the shoulders to the occiput with the patient 's head rested on a pillow in a position judged by the patient to be neutral . After verification that the patient will be properly centered , the fluoroscopy unit and operating room table will remain fixed for the rest of the study . Patients ' monitoring includes pulse oximetry , noninvasive blood pressure electrocardiography , state and response Entropy ( SE and RE ) and train of four ( TOF ) stimulation of the ulnar nerve . Anesthetic technique will be standardized in all studied . After breathing 100 % oxygen for 3 min through a facemask in a neutral position , anesthesia will be induced with fentanyl 2-3µg/kg/min and propofol 2-3 mg/kg to achieve a SE < 50 and the difference between RE and SE less than 10 . Rocuronium 0.6 mg.kg will be administered for complete relaxation on the TOF ( TOF-GE , Datex-Ohmeda Division , Instrumentarium Corporation , Helsinki , Finland ) . Anesthesia will be maintained using sevoflurane end-tidal concentrations of 2.5-3.5 % in oxygen via a bag-mask for 3 min before endotracheal intubation . Standard precautions against radiation exposure will be taken , movement of the cervical spines during endotracheal intubation will be studied and recorded with portable X-ray machine . Laryngoscopy will be performed twice , once with the King Vision and once with the Macintosh laryngoscope in random order . For the first device , the patient 's mouth will be opened and the tip of the tracheal tube will be introduced into the glottis . The second device will be studied in an identical manner , and intubation will be completed with the second device . The intubators who will participate in the study will receive a standard manikin based training which will be followed with 50 successful endotracheal intubations in the clinical practice with the use of Macintosh and King Vision® laryngoscopes . The studied data during intubation will be collected by an independent investigator . The intubator will attempt to minimize neck movement during both techniques through the acceptance of the first view [ 8 ] that will offer a reasonable opportunity to adequately position the tracheal tube at the glottis opening . Three lateral radiographs will be taken with a portable X-ray system provides fixed images from which hard copies are generated . Patient will be served as their own control with reference to the first image , which will be obtained after induction of anesthesia before laryngoscopy and intubation , with the patient in neutral position . A further two images , one with the Macintosh and one with King Vision laryngoscopes . These images will be taken at the time of laryngeal exposure , with the tip of the endotracheal tube passing between the vocal cords . On each image , lines will be drawn to mark the relative position of the occiput , atlas ( C1 ) , axis ( C2 ) and the fifth cervical vertebra ( C5 ) . The angle between each of these lines will be measured to determine the degree of angulation of C1 , C2 and C5 relative to the occiput and each other . [ 9 ] The radiographs will be reviewed by a radiology consultant who will be blinded to the order of intubation technique and unfamiliar with the laryngoscopes being used . Statistical Analysis Data will be tested for normality using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test . Fisher exact test will be used for categorical data . Repeated two-way ANOVA and paired t-test will be used to study the changes in the primary and secondary endpoints during each intervention . The Wilcoxon 2 rank sum test will be used for the non-parametric values . The investigators will avoid the carryover effect ( persistence of the effect of the first intervention on the operative conditions into the second period ) through the comparison of the effects of period ( time effect ) and the order of treatment using independent t-tests .

New York State Psychiatric Institute,NCT01919216,Placebo Effects in the Treatment of Depression: Cognitive and Neural Mechanisms,New York State Psychiatric Institute,4,1,Major Depressive Disorder,Drug,Citalopram,Treatment,Quadruple,Studies of the neural mechanisms underlying placebo effects in antidepressant clinical trials largely have been limited to demonstrating objective differences in brain activity between responders and non-responders to placebo . This 8 week Placebo-controlled and Open groups study employs a novel antidepressant trial design with integrated functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) to manipulate patient expectancy and examine its neural mediators .,"The placebo effect represents a potent treatment for Major Depressive Disorder ( MDD ) -placebo response in acute randomized controlled trials ( RCTs ) of antidepressant medications averages 30 % , and meta-analyses have estimated the proportion of medication response attributable to placebo to be 50-75 % . Patient expectancy is the mechanism of placebo effects in antidepressant RCTs and has been positively associated with medication response . Determining how expectancy alters the course of MDD could lead to methods of optimizing placebo effects and improving the treatment of MDD . In addition , investigating the neurobiology of placebo effects has the potential to elucidate the pathophysiology of MDD and the mechanisms of action of antidepressant treatments . Brain regions implicated in expectancy and placebo effects comprise prefrontal cortical ( PFC ) areas , amygdala , insular cortex , rostral anterior cingulate cortex ( rACC ) , and dopaminergic reward pathways in the striatum . Pathological decreases in PFC and striatal function , increases in limbic activity , and disordered connectivity between these regions have all been observed in MDD , and the rostral and dorsal ACC have been repeatedly linked to antidepressant treatment response . Therefore , studying placebo effects offers a window into the functioning of the neural circuits that are disturbed in MDD and improve with effective treatment . The goals of this study are to determine whether expectancy affects the outcome of antidepressant pharmacotherapy and to investigate the neural mechanisms of expectancy effects . These will be accomplished by conducting a clinical trial randomizing adult outpatients with MDD to 8 weeks of treatment in high vs. low expectancy conditions . The high expectancy condition will be open administration of citalopram , while the low expectancy condition will be placebo-controlled administration of citalopram . The neural mechanisms of expectancy will be determined using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( fMRI ) paradigms to investigate treatment activation differences in brain regions associated with placebo effects and MDD .",2013-08-05,"February 26, 2020","Inclusion Criteria : Men and women aged 24-75 years Diagnosed with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( DSM ) IV Major Depressive Disorder , nonpsychotic 24-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression ( HRSD ) score ≥ 16 Willing to and capable of providing informed consent and complying with study procedures Subjects are right-handed Using appropriate contraceptive method if woman of child-bearing age Exclusion Criteria : Current comorbid Axis I DSM IV disorder other than Nicotine Dependence , Adjustment Disorder , Panic Disorder , Generalized Anxiety Disorder , or Social Phobia Diagnosis of substance abuse or dependence ( excluding Nicotine Dependence ) within the past 12 months History of psychosis or psychotic disorder , mania or bipolar disorder Subject is considered to be at significant risk of suicide based on current mental status and recent history History of allergic or adverse reaction to citalopram , or nonresponse to adequate trial of citalopram ( at least 4 weeks at dose of 40mg ) or escitalopram ( at least 4 weeks at dose of 20mg ) Subject is considered based on history to be unlikely to respond to the single agent citalopram ( i.e. , subjects with treatment resistant depression ) Current treatment with psychotherapy Clinical Global Impression ( CGI ) -Severity score of 7 at baseline Clinical Interview Current or recent ( within the past 4 weeks ) treatment with any of the following : antidepressants , antipsychotics , mood stabilizers , isoniazid , glucocorticoids , opiates , centrally active antihypertensive drugs ( e.g . clonidine , reserpine ) Subject has metal in body or prior history working with metal fragments ( e.g. , as a machinist ) , tattoos , or unable to tolerate the scanning procedures ( i.e. , severe obesity , claustrophobia ) Acute , severe , or unstable medical illness",65,1,24 Years,75 Years

Ohio State University,NCT01852747,Comparison of Actifuse ABX and Local Bone in Spinal Surgery,Ohio State University,4,0,Scoliosis,Procedure,Multilevel Spinal fusion with Actifuse ABX®,Treatment,,This study is being done to compare people who had a standard of care spinal fusion using part of their local bone graft ( a small amount of bone from the region of the spine where the fusion is occurring ) to correct an adult spinal deformity and people who will have a standard of care spinal fusion using a mixture of Actifuse ABX® ( a market approved bone graft substitute ) and a local bone graft ( a small amount of bone from the region of the spine where the fusion is occurring ) . This study will compare the outcomes of both groups to help the Orthopaedic surgeon conducting spinal fusions in the future . Investigators expect that Actifuse ABX® will be as good if not better than just a local bone graft .,"The current method for posterolateral lumbar fusion surgeries utilizes autograft bone typically derived from the patient 's iliac crest . However , complications have been reported concerning the use of iliac crest bone , that include additional healing time due to the secondary surgical site and gait abnormalities . Clinicians are in need of an adequate alternative , and many have begun testing growth factors or synthetic compounds used in conjunction with local bone autografts . Though this avoids the need for a secondary surgical site , synthetic materials are not without their own limitations . These compounds must achieve similar growth and fusion rates as native bone . This study will test the applicability of Actifuse , a synthetic bone graft substitute , in instrumented multi-level adult spinal deformity surgery . Actifuse is a silicate substituted calcium phosphate . It is osteostimulative , and is a bone void filler intended for orthopedic applications such as a filler for gaps and voids that are not intrinsic to the stability of the bony structure . Actifuse has several features that mimic human bone ( amount of silicon , resorption rate , etc ) . It provides a scaffold for long-term bone healing and is intended to be packed gently into bony voids or gaps of the skeletal system , i.e . extremities , pelvis and spine including use in posterolateral spinal fusion procedures with appropriate stabilizing hardware . These defects may be surgically created osseous defects or osseous defects created from traumatic injury to the bone . The product provides a bone void filler that is resorbed and replaced by native bone during the healing process . Actifuse accelerates bone growth by combining an interconnected macro- and micro- porous structure with osteostimulative chemistry created through a patented silicate substitution process to attach and stimulate osteoprogenitor cells ( OPCs ) and mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs ) . It resists irrigation and can be easily viewed on x-rays to monitor healing . Previous groups have shown that Actifuse is successful in the laboratory as well as in patients ; however , previously reported literature has not studied the efficacy of Actifuse in instrumented multi-level adult spinal deformity . Based on previous literature , investigators expect the Actifuse ABX to successfully fuse to native bone growth and promote fusion as well as an autograft replacement . Potential pitfalls include Actifuse not functioning as well in place of native bone . If this occurs , investigators will conduct revision surgery to ensure proper bone union . The success of this project could have significant effects for the society at large . It is estimate that over 200,000 arthrodeses are performed each year , and the autologous iliac crest bone graft is often considered the standard of care , therefore these results could improve the outcome of surgery for thousands of patients every year . In addition , it will likely cut down on time the surgeon is in the operating room . It could also speed patient recovery by 1 ) lowering the amount of autologous bone harvested from the patient , and 2 ) taking advantage of the properties of Actifuse ( osteostimulation , resorption rate , etc ) that should result in quicker bone fusing and healing .",2013-04-30,"April 26, 2017",Inclusion Criteria : Patient aged 18 to 80 Patient received primary diagnosis of adult spinal deformity ( with fusion of > 2 levels ) Patient is a candidate for multi-level posterior lumbar fusion Patients that do not meet any of the exclusion criteria Exclusion Criteria : Non-English speaker Current Smoker Prisoner Patient with any of the following : Severe degenerative disease Inflammatory bone disease ( e.g . osteomyelitis ) Metabolic bone disease Radiation bone therapy Existing acute or chronic infections Abnormal calcium metabolism Hypocalcaemia Severe vascular or neurological disease Cardiovascular disease precluding elective surgery Uncontrolled diabetes Severely impaired renal function Documented renal disease Malignant tumors Pregnant or nursing,14,0,18 Years,80 Years

Despite the fact that laparoscopic myomectomy is becoming increasingly popular , laparoscopic myomectomy remains underutilized because of inherit limitations . The limitations include technical challenges such as dissection of the myoma from its bed using the correct plane or multilayer closure of the myoma bed and the concern about the strength of the suturing and the subsequent risk of uterine rupture . As a result , laparoscopic myomectomy is currently performed only by expert surgeons . Hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery ( HALS ) is a unique surgical approach that may overcome the limitations of pure laparoscopic surgery . HALS is not only less invasive than open surgery but also causes less technical challenges than laparoscopic surgery based on its manual nature and ability to use retractors . In gynecologic field , HALS has also been employed in ovarian cancers and large ovarian tumors .

Regular blood samples will be collected on Day 9 . On day 11 , blood , urine , breath , and saliva samples will be collected in the early morning . Participants will be able to leave later in the day .","Background : Cocaine dependence is a public health concern worldwide , with no FDA-approved pharmacological treatment for this condition . Thus , there is a need for controlled clinical trials to evaluate potential new pharmacological treatments . Adherence to a medication regime is a major factor in the success of treatment . In controlled clinical trials , medication adherence is often monitored by measuring specific markers ingested with the medication . No such markers are validated for use in studies of cocaine dependence treatment . Objective : Evaluate the feasibility of oral acetazolamide and quinine as adherence markers in trials of cocaine dependence treatment by determining their pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic interactions with intravenous ( IV ) cocaine . Study Population : Up to 30 healthy cocaine users aged 18-50 years who smoked or used IV cocaine for at least one year and at least three times per month during the three months prior to screening and had a positive urine test for cocaine within the last 6 months . Experimental Design and Methods : Participants are admitted to a secure residential research unit on and undergo baseline assessments on Day -1 , receive training on Day 0 , and receive single doses of IV cocaine ( 25 mg ) on Days 1 , 5 and 10 . On Days 1 , 5 , and 10 , dried blood spot specimens are collected up to 3 times daily over 1.5 h. Single oral doses of acetazolamide ( 15 mg ) are given on Days 2-5 and quinine ( 80 mg ) on Days 7-10 . Blood , oral fluid , and breath specimens are collected for up to 71 h , 70 h , and 22 h , respectively , after drug administration on Days 1 , 4 , 5 , 9 and 10 . Participants will wear the AutoSense device on Days 1 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 8 , 9 and 10 for up to 12 hours each day . All voided urine is collected throughout the study . Outcome measures : Primary outcome measures include cocaine , benzoylecgonine , ecgonine methylester , norcocaine , acetazolamide , and quinine pharmacokinetics in plasma and urine and whether subjective and cardiovascular responses to IV cocaine are changed when coadministered with oral acetazolamide or quinine . Secondary outcome measures include cocaine pharmacokinetics in oral fluid and breath , plasma activity of BChE and carboxylesterase ( enzymes which metabolize cocaine ) , and basal and post-cocaine administration serum concentrations of leptin and other appetitive peptides ( e.g . ghrelin , GLP-1 , insulin , PYY , amylin ) . Benefits : There is no direct benefit to participants , but the study is likely to yield generalizable knowledge about the feasibility of acetazolamide and quinine as markers of medication adherence in future studies of pharmacological treatment for cocaine dependence .

The null hypothesis stated that there were no significant differences in dentoskeletal changes between FLMGM treated group and control untreated group .,"The current study was prospective , controlled , parallel groups , clinical trial conducted at the department of Orthodontics between May 2009 and June 2011 . The protocol of study was approved by the council of scientific research and postgraduate studies , on the 5/April/2009 . Of the 43 patients initially enrolled , 38 completed this trial and comprised the final sample , and 5 ( 4 treated , 1 untreated ) were excluded . The final sample comprised 38 subjects who completed this trial . All patients and parents gave prior informed consent to their inclusion in the investigation . Patients of both groups were followed on a parallel basis during a period of 8 months and the trial included all patients regardless of achievement of a Class I incisor relationship . All patient of treatment group ( n=21 ) were treated using FLMGM without extractions or any other form of orthodontic treatment , though the treatment was continued beyond this time point if the Class II malocclusion was not fully corrected and clinical objectives were not achieved . On the other hand , no orthodontic treatment was performed during that duration for the subjects of control group ( n=17 ) , and most of control subjects were offered suitable treatment at a later date . For each patient , a direct digital lateral cephalogram was taken pre- and post- treatment/observation using PAX 400 ( VATECH CO. , Korea ) with the same settings . All cephalograms were digitized on screen by a cursor-driven mouse and analyzed in a blind manner by the same orthodontist using a commercial cephalometric software ( Viewbox , version 3.1.1.13 , dHAL Software , Kifissia , Hellas , Greece ) . All measurements were reduced to life size ( radiographic enlargement of 7.54 % in the median plane ) .

University of Liverpool,NCT01856205,Safety and Efficacy Study of Intravenous Immunoglobulin to Treat Japanese Encephalitis,University of Liverpool,2,1,Japanese Encephalitis,Drug,Intravenous immunoglobulin [ImmunoRel™ (batch 20081217)],Treatment,Triple,"Japanese encephalitis is caused by a viral infection of the brain transmitted by the bite of an infected mosquito . Patients with Japanese encephalitis can rapidly develop worsening conscious level and seizures . Around a third will die from the infection and half of survivors have serious long-term neurological disability . The majority of those affected are children . There are many causes of viral encephalitis , however Japanese encephalitis virus is the most common cause worldwide with over 60,000 cases annually . It occurs over much of Asia and the geographical range is expanding . There is no specific treatment for Japanese encephalitis virus , although several have been trialed . In this study we examined the effect of a new treatment , called intravenous immunoglobulin , on children with Japanese encephalitis in Nepal . Prior studies have suggested intravenous immunoglobulin may neutralize Japanese encephalitis virus and suppress damaging inflammation in the brain . It has previously been used in individual cases but never examined in a randomized trial . There was recently a trial of IVIG in West Nile encephalitis in the United States , in which Professor Solomon was on the Scientific Advisory Committee . In this study we will look if intravenous immunoglobulin is safe in this context , and that this treatment may alter the way the immune system manages the infection . Therefore , in this pilot study we will test the hypothesis that IVIG can be safely given to children with suspected JE , with no increased risk of serious adverse events compared with placebo . The aim of this proposal is to conduct a pilot safety and tolerability randomized placebo controlled trial of intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIG ) in patients with Japanese encephalitis , to explore the relationship between JEV viral load , pro-inflammatory markers called cytokines and blood brain barrier markers , and the effect of IVIG on these relationships .","Japanese encephalitis ( JE ) is the most important epidemic encephalitis worldwide , causing approximately 35-50,000 cases and 10-15,000 deaths annually . Half of the survivors have severe neuropsychiatric sequelae , posing a large socio-economic burden on communities that can ill afford it . JE virus ( JEV , genus flavivirus , family Flaviviridae ) has a 50 nm lipoprotein envelope surrounding a nucleocapsid comprised of core protein and 11 KB of single-stranded positive-sense RNA . The genome has 5 ' and 3 ' untranslated regions ( UTR ) , and a single open reading frame encoding genes for three structural proteins ( core - C , pre-membrane - prM and envelope - E ) and 7 non-structural ( NS ) proteins . The E protein is critical for viral attachment and entry into cells , and along with NS1 and NS3 is a major target of the immune response . JEV is an arthropod-borne virus ( arbovirus ) , transmitted in an enzootic cycle between birds , pigs and other vertebrates by mosquitoes , especially Culex species . Almost all of the population in affected parts of Asia is infected by early adulthood , but only a small proportion ( about 1 in 300 ) develops clinical features . These may range from a non-specific febrile illness to a severe meningoencephalitis , in which seizures and clinical signs of raised intracranial pressure are common , and carry a poor prognosis . In addition JEV causes a poliomyelitis-like flaccid paralysis . The distribution of the four genotypes of JEV across Asia was thought to explain the clinical epidemiology , but is now thought to be a reflection of the virus ' origin in Southeast Asia , and spread from here . However subtle differences in the genome may be important in determining neurological presentations of flaviviruses . Although there are vaccines against JEV , they are not available for many of the people that need them , because of issues over cost and production . Progress is being made to overcome these difficulties , and newer vaccines are being used increasingly . In fact Nepal has been at the forefront of the use of a single dose of live attenuated SA14-14-2 vaccine for JE . However , continues to spread across Asia , and there is no treatment . Interferon-α ( IFN-α ) , which is produced as part of the innate response to JEV infection , and which has antiviral activity against the virus , was thought to be the most promising treatment . However , a randomized placebo-controlled trial showed recombinant IFN-α2a at 10 million units/m2/day did not improve the outcome . The pathogenesis of JE is incompletely understood , but by comparison with other positive sense RNA viral encephalitides , is likely to involve a mixture of viral cytopathology and immunopathology .The role of steroids in JEV has been examined in one randomized-placebo controlled trial in Thailand , which failed to show any benefit . IVIG currently offers one of the best possibilities for improving the outcome in JE . It has been used presumptively in patients with flavivirus encephalitis , including JE , and is postulated to act in two ways : IVIG produced in countries where flaviviruses are endemic contains high titers of specific neutralizing antibody , because most of the population have been exposed to the virus , and thus have antibodies . In addition IVIG has non-specific anti-inflammatory properties , particularly through the suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines ( e.g . in Kawasaki disease ) . We aim to examine the role of IVIG in JE , and also look at its effects on pro-inflammatory cytokines . The role of antibody in protection against severe disease in Japanese encephalitis : The humoral immune response in JE has been well characterized . When disease is due to primary infection ( i.e . when JEV is the first flavivirus with which an individual has been infected ) a rapid and potent IgM response occurs in serum and CSF within days of infection . By day 7 most patients have elevated titers . Attempts to isolate virus are usually negative in such patients . However , the failure to mount an IgM response is associated with positive virus isolation and a fatal outcome . Antibody to JEV probably protects the host by restricting viral replication during the viraemic phase , before the virus crosses the blood brain barrier . Evidence from other flaviviruses suggests it may also limit damage during established encephalitis by neutralizing extracellular virus and facilitating lysis of infected cells by antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity . In surviving patients immunoglobulin class switching occurs , and within 30 days most have IgG in the serum and CSF . Asymptomatic infection with JEV is also associated with elevated IgM in the serum , but not CSF . In patients with secondary infection ( i.e . those who have previously been infected with a different flavivirus , for example dengue infection , or yellow fever vaccination ) there is an anamnastic response to flavivirus group common antigens . This secondary pattern of antibody activation is characterized by an early rise in IgG with a subsequent slow rise in IgM . Inflammation in Japanese encephalitis : At autopsy in JE , the brain is usually edematous , with congestion of the parenchyma . Cerebellar and uncal herniation are common . Histopathologically JE is characterized by perivascular inflammation with recruitment of macrophages , neutrophils and lymphocytes . The basal ganglia and anterior horns cells of the spinal cord are particularly affected , providing a pathological correlate for the Parkinsonism , and poliomyelitis-like flaccid paralysis , which may be seen . Viral antigen is predominantly in neurons although microglial cells , astrocytes and vascular endothelial cells are also infected . When survival is prolonged beyond 7 days acellular necrotic zones are seen , usually in the region of small or medium sized arteries which are surrounded by edema . Immunopathology in Japanese encephalitis : The pathogenesis of JE is incompletely understood , but available evidence indicates that , as with a number of other positive sense RNA viral encephalitides including lymohoctyic chorio meningitis virus ( LCMV ) in mice Sindbis virus , dengue virus , yellow fever virus and West Nile virus , there is immune-mediated damage as well as viral cytopathology . Pro-inflammatory cytokine responses in Japanese encephalitis : As detailed below under Preliminary Studies , there is accumulating evidence that the pro-inflammatory cytokine response may make an important contribution to immunopathology in JE . Among cytokines studied , interleukin ( IL ) -6 , IL-8 chemokine ( CXC motif ) ligand ( CXCL-8 ) , and tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) - α appear to be associated with a fatal outcome . There is also new evidence on the importance of other cytokines and chemokines in encephalitis caused by other flaviviruses , particularly West Nile virus . There are several mechanisms by which the pro-inflammatory response may be deleterious . Recent studies have shown IL-6 , which is produced by neurons , microglia , astrocytes and recruited macrophages in response to viral CNS infection , causes an increased permeability of the blood brain barrier ( BBB ) , which leads to interstitial cerebral edema , and raised intracranial pressure . TNF-α is produced by microglia , astrocytes and macrophages . Its multiple pro-inflammatory properties include upregulation of class I and II MHC expression , upregulation of cellular adhesion molecules , increased permeability of the BBB , and upregulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase ( iNOS ) , leading to the production of nitric oxide ( NO ) . At high concentrations NO is directly toxic to CNS cells , causing oxidative damage , and apoptosis . Recent evidence suggests that the early cytokine and chemokines responses may also be important in determining whether the virus even gains entry across the blood brain barrier to enter the CNS . In one study of West Nile virus infection , mice deficient in Toll-like receptor 3 ( Tlr3 ) , which recognizes viral double stranded RNA , were relatively resistant to lethal infection . This was associated with reduced cytokine production ( particularly TNF-α and IL-6 ) , and increased viral load in the periphery , compared to wild type mice . TNF-α receptor 1 signaling was found to be vital for blood brain barrier compromise upon Tlr3 stimulation by the virus . In addition to affecting virally-infected cells , the inflammatory response in the CNS may also damage non-infected cells to cause bystander cell death . The importance of the chemokine receptor CCR5 , and its ligand CCL5 ( also known as RANTES , regulated on activation , normally T cell expressed and secreted ) in CNS inflammation caused by flaviviruses was shown recently by their prominent up-regulation in a mouse model of West Nile virus infection . This was associated with CNS infiltration of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells , Natural killer ( NK ) 1.1+ cells and macrophages expressing the receptor . The significance of CCR5 in pathogenesis was established by mortality studies in which infection of CCR5-/- mice was rapidly and uniformly fatal . Importantly , our recent study ( see below ) found that CCL5 was also elevated in the plasma of humans with JE , where higher levels were associated with a fatal outcome . Although clinical studies in humans with JE , and parallel studies in animal models of flavivirus encephalitis suggest elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines appear to be important and associated with a bad outcome in JE , it is not clear whether control of this strong pro-inflammatory response will improve the outcome . We will conduct a pilot double-blind placebo-controlled study on safety , tolerability and immunological markers of efficacy of IVIG in children with JE in Nepal , followed by a larger efficacy study . Preliminary studies : Professor Solomon has been studying JE and related flaviviruses since 1994 . With the support of his group and collaborators , he has shown that JEV is the most important cause of viral encephalitis in Vietnam , as it is in most of South and Southeast Asia . He showed that seizures and raised intracranial pressure are common clinical manifestations of infection . In collaboration with colleagues in Malaysia he developed and field-tested a simple rapid diagnostic test for diagnosing JE in the rural settings where it occurs . This test was also able to distinguish JE from dengue - a related flavivirus that circulates in Asia . Although dengue is better known as a cause of hemorrhagic disease , Prof Solomon and his team showed that it is also an important cause of neurological disease . Prof Solomon also showed that as well as presenting with encephalitis , JEV can present with a poliomyelitis-like acute flaccid paralysis , which has also more recently been recognized in adults infected with West Nile virus . Based on in vitro and in vivo data , together with phase I/II studies in humans , Prof Solomon conducted a randomized placebo controlled trial of interferon α-2b in children with JE ( the only antiviral trial ever conducted for JE ) . However the study showed that it did not improve the outcome . To begin exploring the possible contribution of viral genetic diversity to the clinical epidemiology of JE , Prof Solomon examined the molecular evolution of the virus across Asia , and showed that the virus probably originated in the Indonesia and Malaysia region , and evolved here into the different genotypes , the most recent of which subsequently spread across Asia . The Liverpool group has more recently begun examining inflammation in JE . A recent pathological study in humans and a mouse model confirms the importance of the inflammatory response , and suggests there may be damage to the vascular endothelium . A study of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines in humans with JE has shown that CSF levels of interleukin ( IL ) -6 , tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) -α , interferon ( IFN ) -α and the chemokine CXCL8 ( IL-8 ) were higher in patients who died than in those who survived . IFN-γ and nitric oxide ( NO ) were also detected in the CSF of fatal cases and survivors . These findings extend the observations of other investigators on TNF-α and CXCL8 indicating a strong pro-inflammatory response in JE is associated with a poor outcome . It was also shown that CCL5 ( RANTES ) is expressed in the plasma of humans with JE , and that high plasma levels are associated with fatal disease . Clinical data from other flavivirus encephalitides support the concept that inflammation may contribute to the pathogenesis . For example , immunosuppressed transplant patients infected with West Nile virus develop CNS disease later than immunocompetent patients . Cytokines do not act in isolation , and indeed the pluripotency and redundancy of biological response is one of their characteristic features . Recent microarray experiments show a wide range of molecules are upregulated in CNS inflammatory conditions . In addition the Liverpool group has studied the relationship between antibody responses and outcome . Along with other investigators , we have shown that the presence of antibody in the serum and CSF is associated with survival . JE in Nepal : Japanese encephalitis was first recorded in Nepal in 1978 and is currently endemic in 24 districts . Since its first appearance there have been over 26,667 cases and 5381 deaths . The early mortality figures were quoted at up to 60 % , but more recently they have improved to approximately 20 % in those under 15 years . The morbidity is thought to be around 50 % . As a result of concern about the disease , there was immunization against JE in 1999 in 3 districts , this has now been extended to cover the majority of the affected districts . In addition the Government vaccinated around 200 000 pigs in the Terai zone in 2001 . Despite these successes there are still ongoing cases of JE . In 2006 there were 292 confirmed cases and 1481 AES cases of unknown etiology . These figures may under represent the actual numbers of cases due to logistical issues , deaths before hospital admission , and difficulties in confirming the diagnosis of JE with paired sera and CSF samples . Recent serosurveillance in the animal hosts for JE in Nepal clearly shows the virus is still present in the wild and is likely to remain . Seroprevalence was 48 % ( 102/212 ) , in pigs , 27 % ( 15/56 ) in ducks and 50 % ( 6/12 ) in horses from a total of 280 sera collected from 10 districts of which 44 % were positive overall . Hence , JE is still a major public health problem in Nepal , and there is a pressing need to develop better treatments . Currently IVIG is used in Nepal to treat a range of pediatric conditions , including Guillain-Barré syndrome , idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura . Rationale for use of IVIG in JE : There is currently no antiviral or immunomodulatory treatment for JE or indeed any flavivirus encephalitis . As outlined above , the only trials conducted , using interferon alpha , and using dexamethasone , failed to show any benefit . Based on data in preclinical studies , and observational studies in humans ( see below ) , IVIG currently offers the best hope for treatment , through its antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties . Established pediatric uses of IVIG : IVIG has been established as the standard treatment for a number of childhood immune mediated diseases including Guillain-Barré syndrome , Kawasaki 's disease , immune thrombocytopenia and Dermatomyositis . In Kawasaki disease , T cell and B cell activation is down regulated by IVIG . In thrombocytopenic purpura blockade of FCγ receptors is thought to be important , which may result in down regulation of secretory cytokines . In Guillain-Barré syndrome and dermatomyositis inhibition of complement binding and prevention of membranolytic attack complex formation are possible mechanisms of IVIG action . In addition , IVIG has been employed in the treatment and prophylaxis of a number of childhood viral infections where the neutralizing antibodies in the IVIG were thought to be important . IVIG has been used to treat , and later to provide prophylaxis , for children with hypo- or agammaglobulinamia with chronic enteroviral meningoencephalitis . Importantly , children with X-linked agammaglobulinaemia and with enteroviral meningoencephalitis treated with intensive and prolonged IVIG therapy have achieved long-lasting clinical and viral remission ( negative CSF viral culture and PCR ) . However , the patients relapsed when IVIG was tapered , indicating a major beneficial role of IVIG in this condition . IVIG infusion in infants and children with AIDS treated with zidovudine therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of serious bacterial infections ( 16.9 % IVIG group vs 24.3 % placebo group ( relative risk , 0.60 ; 95 percent confidence interval , 0.35 to 1.04 ; p = 0.07 ) . In respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ) infections immunoglobulin therapy has been shown to be safe and generally well tolerated in a randomized controlled trial ( RCT ) involving 102 previously healthy children , though the beneficial effect of reducing hospitalization and intensive care unit day were marginal in children with severe disease . Other established indications for passive immunization with IVIG include parvovirus B19 infection . Use of IVIG in flavivirus encephalitis : There is strong evidence to suggest that JEV , like other neurotropic flaviviruses , may be more susceptible to antibody-mediated , rather than cell-mediated immune responses . For JEV , and other neurotropic flaviviruses , clearance of virus is not dependent on cytolytic T cell activity , in contrast to non-neurotropic viruses . Neurons , as terminally differentiated cells , do not express MHC-1 , which would subject them to lysis by CD8 T cells and non-replacement . Animal data support the importance of antibody mediated immunity . In one study , Konishi et . al . immunized mice with plasmid DNAs encoding JEV proteins that induce neutralizing antibody responses or cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses , and then challenged with lethal intraperitoneal doses of virus . They showed that neutralizing antibody prevents virus dissemination from the peripheral site to the brain , and that antibody-mediated mechanisms of protection were more efficient than the cytotoxic T cell responses . These findings supported earlier work showing that anti-envelope protein antibodies , are the most critical protective component in a JEV challenge model , and more recent passive antibody transfer experiments . In vitro work in mice shows a protective role for IVIG given prophylactically to prevent the flavivirus causing tick borne encephalitis and a protective effect when used as a treatment . In work by several different groups , use of IVIG containing specific anti West Nile Virus antibody during the viraemic phase , before the virus had entered the CNS , showed a dramatic 100 % survival . Similar work with Tick borne encephalitis had a 100 % effect on survival . There are now good data that in animal models of flavivirus encephalitis , peripheral administration of antibody neutralizes virus even after it has entered the central nervous system . Clinical Data : Because of the of preclinical data supporting a role for antibody treatment in flavivirus encephalitis , antibody treatment ( in the form of IVIG ) has also been used on a compassionate basis in JE , and West Nile encephalitis . In addition IVIG is currently being investigated for West Nile encephalitis in a National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) sponsored randomized placebo controlled trial in the United States ( for which Prof Solomon is on the Scientific Steering Committee ) . IVIG was used in a 49 year old traveler returning from Vietnam who presented with JE to an Italian hospital . IVIG has also been used to treat West Nile virus infections in five patients in Israel and three in the United States . IVIG was also assessed in a placebo controlled trial for West Nile virus infection in the United States with no serious adverse effects of the drug . Rationale for Dose : The most commonly used dose of IVIG is 2g/kg , either given as a single infusion , or divided as 400mg/kg for five days . In Kawasaki disease 2g/kg as a single ten hour infusion is well tolerated , and was shown to be the most effective regime . In Guillain-Barré syndrome in children and adults the drug is most often given over 5 days , and this is the regime that has been used in patients with flavivirus encephalitis , and will be used in this study . Drug and Intervention : Children that meet the entry criteria will be randomly assigned to receive IVIG , ( Reliance Biophamaceuticals Pvt . Ltd. ) at a dose of 400mg/kg/day for 5 days , or an equivalent volume of 0.9 % normal saline , using an established technique for giving fluid treatment in a double blind manner . Drug Presentation : We will use Immunorel™ intravenous immunoglobulin , which is produced by Reliance Biophamaceuticals Pvt . Ltd. , and manufactured in China and is available through the Yetichem Pharmacy , Sundhara , Kathmandu and Shriran Pharmacy , Maharajgunj , Kathmandu . This is the IVIG product currently used most often in Nepal . As for most other parts of Asia , the seroprevalence of JE in China is high . By age 10 , approximately one third of children have neutralizing antibodies to JEV , and by adulthood , the majority of the population has been exposed . There are extensive data showing that IVIG from areas where flaviviruses are endemic contains significant amounts of neutralizing antibody . For example for IVIG from Israel contains moderate to high levels of neutralizing antibody to West Nile Virus . Even though West Nile virus has only circulated in the United States for a few years , high levels of neutralizing antibody have been found in some IVIG lots . Anti-JEV neutralizing antibody in IVIG from Asia : We have recently examined the neutralizing antibody titres in a range of IVIG products from India and China , using the plaque reduction neutralization assay ( PRNT ) 50 . In this study we found that IVIG from the UK , contained no antibody , and serum from a laboratory worker who had been vaccinated against JEV contained a small amount of neutralizing antibody . In contrast IVIG manufactured by Bharrat , Hualan , Sichun and Reliance companies all had neutralizing antibody titres of greater than 1 in 400 , with Reliance having the greatest titre , at nearly 1 in 750 . Immunorel™ is packed in clear and colorless vials and comes in 2 pack sizes , each containing IVIG at a dose of 0.05g/ml ( ie 50mg/ml ) . The available vials are , 50ml ( containing 2.5g ) , and 100ml ( 5.0g ) . Children will thus receive 400mg/kg/day of IVIG which is equivalent to 8mls/kg/day of Immunorel™ solution , or 8ml/kg/day of 0.9 % normal saline . Pharmacokinetics : Distribution studies have been done with a range of IVIG preparations . In a study of patients who developed aseptic meningitis ( as a complication of the infusion ) , after receiving 2 g/kg intravenously in 2 divided doses , the serum level increases fivefold and then declines by 50 % over the next 72 hours as extravascular redistribution took place . By 21- 28 days , pretreatment levels were reached . The half-life was 18-32 days , and was similar to native immunoglobulin . In the first 48 hours after the infusion the CSF concentration increased 1.5 to 7-fold but returned to normal within a week . CNS penetration may be expected in patients with viral meningoencephalitis or even encephalomyelitis as there will be a break down of the blood-brain-barrier . Metabolism of IVIG takes place in the cells of the reticuloendothelial system where immunoglobulins and immunoglobulin complexes are broken down . Studies with Immunorel® in normal subjects showed that peak serum concentrations occur immediately after intravenous injection , and are dose related . Within 24 hours up to 30 % of a dose may be removed by catabolism and distribution . Data concerning distribution suggest that IVIg distributes throughout intravascular ( 60 % ) and extravascular ( 40 % ) spaces . The serum half life of immunoglobulin ranges between 21 and 29 days . Reaction Associated with Intravenous Immunoglobulin : Reactions to intravenous immunoglobulin tend to be related to the infusion rate and are most likely to occur during the first hour of the infusion . We will monitor the patient 's vital signs and general status regularly throughout the infusion . The types of reactions that have been reported include abdominal pain , headache , chest-tightness , facial flushing or pallor , hot sensations , dyspnoea , non-urticarial skin rash , itching , hypotension , nausea or vomiting . Should any of these reactions develop during infusion of IVIG , the infusion will be temporarily stopped until the patient improves clinically ( 5 to 10 minutes ) and then cautiously recommenced at a slower rate . Some patients may develop delayed adverse reactions to IVIG such as nausea , vomiting , chest pain , rigors , dizziness or aching legs . These adverse reactions occur after the infusion has stopped but usually within 24 hours . True hypersensitivity reactions to IVIG such as urticaria , angioedema , bronchospasm or hypotension occur very rarely . Should an anaphylactic reaction develop after IVIG , the infusion will be stopped and treatment instituted with adrenaline , oxygen , antihistamine and steroids . Hemolytic anemia and neutropenia have been reported in rare instances in association with IVIG treatment . Mild and moderate elevations of serum transaminases ( AST , ALT , gamma GT ) have been observed in a small number of patients given IVIG . Such changes were transient and not associated with the transmission of hepatitis . Rare complications an aseptic meningitis syndrome ( AMS ) , thrombophlebitis , renal dysfunction and acute renal failure have occurred in patients receiving IVIG . Liver and renal function will be monitored during the study . Reactions Associated with Immunorel™ : i . Primary Immune Deficiency : In patients with immunodeficiency syndrome receiving IVIG at a monthly dose of 400 mg/kg body weight , the reactions reported have been malaise , feeling of faintness , fever , chills , headache , nausea , vomiting , chest tightness , dyspnoea and chest , back or hip pain . Mild erythema at the infusion site has also been reported in some cases . ii . Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura ( ITP ) : In the treatment of adult and paediatric patients with ITP at a dose of 400 mg/kg body weight , the systemic reactions were observed only in less than 3 % of the patients . The other symptoms which were all mild and transient include chest tightness , a sense of tachycardia and a burning sensation in the head . At a dose of 1000 mg/kg body weight either as a single dose or as two doses on consecutive days in the treatment of adult and paediatric patients with ITP . Adverse reactions have been noted only in less than 10 % of the patients . iii . Bone Marrow Transplantation : At a dose of 500 mg/kg body weight 7 days and two days before transplant and weekly through day 90 post-transplant , adverse reactions were reported in less than 7 % of the patients . All reactions were classified as mild which include headache , flushing , fever and slight back discomfort . iv . Renal : Increases in creatinine and blood urea nitrogen ( BUN ) may be seen as soon as one to two days after an infusion . Progression to oliguria or anuria may require dialysis . Severe occasional adverse events have been reported following IVIG therapy include : acute renal failure , acute tubular necrosis , proximal tubular nephropathy , and osmotic nephosis . Correction of volume depletion by using appropriate fluids prior to initiation of IVIG therapy is therefore essential . Measurement of blood urea nitrogen ( BUN ) and /or serum creatinine should be performed prior to initial infusion of IVIG and again at appropriate intervals afterwards , with monitoring of urine output . iv . General : Reactions to IVIG are related to the rate of infusion . Very rarely an anaphylactoid reactions may occur in patients with no prior history of severe allergic reactions to either intramuscular or intravenous immunoglobulin . Mutagenicity , Carcinogenicity and Impairment of Fertility : Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Gamma IV™ . Hence it is not known whether IVIG can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant woman or can affect the reproduction capacity . Interactions with Other Drugs : The interaction of IVIG with other drugs has not been established in appropriate studies . Passively acquired antibody can interfere with the response to live , attenuated vaccines . Therefore , administration of such vaccines , e.g . poliomyelitis or measles , will be deferred until approximately six months after IVIG infusion . By the same token , immunoglobulins should not be administered for at least two weeks after a vaccine has been given . Contraindications : IVIG is contraindicated in individuals who are known to have an anaphylactic or severe systemic response to immune Globulin ( Human ) . Individuals with selective lgA deficiencies should not receive Gamma IV™ , since these individuals may experience server reactions to the lgA which may be present . Safety Warnings : The product should not be used if it is turbid . Solutions which have been frozen should not be used . Once opened , even if only partially used , vials should be discarded . IVIG should be administered only intravenously as the intramuscular and subcutaneous routes have not been evaluated . Dosage and Administration : In general it is recommended that IVIG be administered by itself on an initial rate of 0.01 to 0.02 ml/kg body weighty/minute for 30 minutes , if well tolerated the rate may be gradually increased to a maximum of 0.08 ml/kg body weight/minute . IVIG is recommended to be given by a separate line by itself without mixing with other intravenous fluids or medications the patients might be receiving . IVIG is not compatible with saline . The dilution if required , IVIG may be diluted with 5 % Dextrose in water .",2013-05-05,"May 18, 2013","Inclusion Criteria : Children aged between 1 and 14 years who had clinically diagnosed encephalitis on the basis of history of fever that lasted less than 14 days , altered consciousness with or without a history of new onset seizures with CSF finding of white cell count less than 1000 cells/mm3 with no organisms on Gram stain and a CSF : plasma glucose ratio > 40 % admitted in Kanti Children 's Hospital and BP Koirala Institute of Health Sciences , Nepal .

Molecular predictive factors for bevacizumab efficacy have not yet been identified therefore selection of patients more likely to benefit from such a treatment approach is not possible . Retrospective analyses suggested that LDH serum levels may influence the clinical activity of anti-angiogenetic drugs . Primary aim of our clinical trial will be to prospectively ascertain whether bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy has an improved clinical activity in patients with high LDH serum levels compared to patients with normal LDH serum levels,"The VEGF-driven tumour pathway has been demonstrated to represent a novel therapeutic target for an innovative class of antineoplastic agents . Among these antiangiogenetic-targeted treatment modalities the anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody bevacizumab has become a new standard of care for first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer . The biological link between hypoxia , LDH levels and the tumour-driven angiogenesis pathway through the abnormal activation of the hypoxia Inducible factor 1 α ( HIF1-α ) is well established . HIF1-α is a key transcription factor that up-regulates a series of genes involved in glycolytic metabolism , angiogenesis , cell survival and erythropoiesis Accordingly to this biological assumption Azuma et al ( Azuma et al 2007 ) demonstrated that high LDH serum levels were associated with tumour over-expression of VEGFA and VEGFR-1 . As a clinical consequence it has been speculated that LDH levels may represent an indirect indicator of activated tumour angiogenesis and ultimately of worse prognosis We previously analysed the role of LDH pre-treatment serum levels in colorectal cancer patients receiving first-line bevacizumab in metastatic colorectal cancer treated with first-line bevacizumab were eligible .

Amorphical Ltd.,NCT01859468,A Study Comparing the Effect of Amorphous Calcium Carbonate (ACC) on Healing Time of Distal Radius Fractures,Amorphical Ltd.,1,0,Distal Radius Fractures,Dietary Supplement,Amorphous calcium carbonate,Treatment,Triple,"Amorphical has a strong basis to believe that the Amorphous Calcium Carbonate ( ACC ) product has an effect on active mineralization during bone remodelling hence , it has a potential to accelerate fracture healing process . The active mineralization can most probably be attributed to the mineral component of this substance . The distal radius fracture was chosen as the model to test the effects of ACC treatment because it includes both trabecular and cortical bone , is accessible for radiographs , has little soft tissue that can distort the radiograph , and is amenable to multiple functional endpoints . Primary objective : To assess the efficacy of treatment with calcium from ACC compared to placebo on radiographic healing time in subjects with distal radius fractures . Secondary objectives : To evaluate the effect of ACC compared to placebo on the improvement in wrist functional outcome following distal radius fracture . To evaluate the safety profile of ACC in this population","Eligible subjects will be treated as follows : Fifty ( 50 ) subjects will be randomly assigned to one of two groups ( N=25 ) .

National Institutes of Health Clinical Center (CC),NCT01851343,Bone Marrow Stromal Cells for Inflammatory Bowel Diseases,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID),1,0,Inflammatory Bowel Disease,Other,Bone Marrow Stromal Cell (BMSC) Infusion,Treatment,,"Background : - Bone marrow stromal cells ( BMSCs ) are cells that can develop into other tissue types , including bone , cartilage , marrow , and blood cells . However , BMSCs are not stem cells there is no evidence that after infusion into another person that BMSCs change into any other cells . Research suggests that BMSCs can travel to different parts of the body and work with immune cells to reduce inflammation and help repair damaged tissues . BMSC infusions have been used in tests to treat moderate to severe inflammatory bowel disease , like Crohn 's disease ( CD ) or ulcerative colitis ( UC ) . These tests have shown some good results , but more research is needed to study their safety and effectiveness . Researchers want to see how well BMSC infusions work to treat CD and UC . The BMSCs will be collected from volunteer donors . Objectives : - To look at the safety and effectiveness of BMSC infusions for moderate to severe CD and UC . Eligibility : - Individuals between 18 and 65 years old with moderate or severe inflammatory bowel disease ( CD or UC ) that has not responded to standard treatment . Design : Participants will have two screening visits . The first will be 15 to 30 days before the first BMSC infusion . The second will be within 14 days of the first BMSC infusion . At the first screening visit , participants will have a physical exam and medical history . They will provide blood , urine , and stool samples . They will also give information about their symptoms and quality of life . At the second screening visit , participants will have their vital signs ( like blood pressure and heart rate ) measured . They will also provide blood samples , and have a colonoscopy with biopsies . During treatment , participants will have one BMSC infusion per week for 4 weeks . Blood and urine samples will be collected at each treatment visit . One week after the last infusion , participants will have a study visit . The tests from the first and second screening visits will be repeated . There will be six follow-up visits at 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 , 12 , and 24 months after the last study visit . Participants will repeat the tests from the first screening visit .","Crohn s disease ( CD ) and ulcerative colitis ( UC ) , the 2 major sub-types of inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) , are chronic , life-long conditions characterized by relapsing inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract . CD has a predilection for the small bowel and the proximal large bowel ; however , it can affect the gastrointestinal tract discontinuously anywhere . UC mainly affects the distal colon but can involve the entire colon as well . In spite of advances in IBD therapeutics , a significant number of patients continue to have symptoms while on conventional medications . The current protocol proposes to study infusions of allogenic bone marrow stromal cells ( BMSCs ) for the treatment of active IBD . The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of BMSC infusions in subjects with IBD and to examine the host clinical and immunologic response to BMSCs . BMSCs possess multi-lineage differentiation potential in bone marrow , and aid in the repair of damaged tissue . They suppress the lymphocyte immune response and target sites of inflammation to promote healing through tissue regeneration . Studies are underway examining the utility of BMSCs to treat several conditions including neurologic disorders , myocardial infarctions , rheumatologic disorders , and gastrointestinal disorders including acute graft-versus-host-disease and IBD . Progress in the understanding of the cell populations involved in the pathogenesis of IBD and the discovery of the potential immunologic and regenerative characteristics of BMSCs have created a new potential direction for IBD therapy . This phase I study will enroll subjects with moderate-to-severe IBD who are refractory to or intolerant of standard therapy . Under the guidance of the NIH Bone Marrow Stromal Cell Transplantation Center , the Cell Processing Section of the Department of Transfusion Medicine at the Clinical Center has developed a procedure for collecting , expanding , and cryopreserving clinical grade BMSCs under an FDA Drug Master File . Marrow will be aspirated from volunteer donors participating on protocol 10-CC-0053 who have passed the standard screening for blood and marrow donors ; BMSCs will be expanded in vitro . Since it is not necessary to HLA-match BMSC donors with their recipients , a BMSC repository will be used as the source of BMSCs for this study . In Arm 1 , the safety of the BMSC infusion dosage ( 4 x 106 cells/kg/dose 10 % ) and schedule ( once a week for 4 weeks ) will be evaluated in 3 non-overlapping IBD subjects . Once safety is established in these subjects , subsequent subjects in Arm 2 will be enrolled without overlap restriction . Subjects will return to the clinic for safety and response assessments at 28 , 56 , 84 , and 112 days after the first infusion . Additional safety visits will be performed at 180 , 360 and 720 days after the first infusion . Safety will be monitored by a Data and Safety Monitoring Board . Response to study drug will be assessed in all patients by changes in symptom scores , endoscopic/histologic findings , quality of life scores , and immunologic/laboratory parameters . Fifty subjects will be evaluated over a 5-year period .",2013-05-08,"March 28, 2019","SUBJECT INCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects who meet ALL of the following criteria will be considered for enrollment into this study : Be 18 to 65 years of age , inclusive , as of the date of enrollment .

University of Calgary,NCT01853124,Emergency Department Probiotic Treatment of Pediatric Gastroenteritis,Dr. Stephen Freedman,3,1,Gastroenteritis,Drug,Placebo,Treatment,Quadruple,"The objective of this study is to determine for previously healthy children who present to a Canadian Emergency Department ( ED ) with acute gastroenteritis ( infection or irritation of the digestive tract ) ; if compared with placebo , the administration of a probiotic agent ( Lacidofil ) will result in a significantly lower proportion of children developing moderate to severe disease over the subsequent 2 weeks and will not be associated with a significantly greater occurrence of side effects .","The burden of acute gastroenteritis ( AGE ) on children and their families continues to be enormous . It accounts for 1.7 million pediatric emergency department ( ED ) visits annually in the United States and nearly 240,000 in Canada . Children often suffer from prolonged and severe illness ; amongst hospitalized Canadian children , 19 % have clinical sepsis , 7 % seizures and 4 % require intensive care unit admission.3 In a study that we conducted at 11 Canadian EDs , 51 % of children experienced moderate to severe disease . Parents rate such episodes as being equivalent to a 10 day admission ( moderate ) and persistent moderate hearing loss ( severe ) . The burden is augmented by the 50 % household transmission rate2 , 6 and 42 % prolonged work absenteeism rate . Apart from supportive care , health-care providers have little to offer to relieve suffering . Probiotics , which are defined as viable microbial preparations that have a beneficial effect on the health of the host , represent a rapidly expanding field . While they are available as over-the-counter products , according to the National Institutes of Health , the Food and Drug Administration has not yet approved a single agent for any health claims . Further , a 2012 meta-analysis concluded that there is limited data to support their indications and no published pediatric gastroenteritis trials reported on side effects . Thus , understanding the benefits and side effects of probiotics is crucial before widespread use can be endorsed . Although probiotic clinical trials have been performed , only one ( still unpublished ) has been ED based . Most studies to date have been significantly flawed and guidelines do NOT endorse their use stating that well-controlled human trials are needed . Consequently , we and others have found that they are rarely used in clinical practice . Reasons cited include ( 1 ) questionable clinical meaning to the outcomes evaluated thus far ; ( 2 ) absence of studies in the appropriate patient population , and ( 3 ) a lack of confidence in the quality of probiotic agents studied . This study will address ( 1 ) the needs of the medical community , which is aware of the widening gap between the number of important pediatric and adult trials and ( 2 ) the interest of caregivers in `` probiotics '' - 71 % are aware of the term ; 31 % believe they may be beneficial in children with diarrhea , and > 90 % would administer a probiotic if it could make their child better . Furthermore , our pilot study has provided promising preliminary data and has proven the feasibility of our methods . Thus we are poised to conduct a randomized controlled trial ( RCT ) that will definitively determine if meaningful benefits are derived from probiotic use and will provide critical information regarding their mechanism of action . This information will impact on practice , the burden of disease , and ensure that children receive the best care possible . The results of our proposed RCT will enable guidelines to either clearly endorse or recommend against the routine use of a probiotic agent in children with Acute Gastroenteritis . We also hypothesize that the therapeutic benefits of probiotics in children with AGE vary by infecting pathogen . We have assembled a team to bridge the gap between the clinical RCT team , molecular diagnostics , and immunologic to quantify the pathogen-specific effects of probiotics . The latter is likely because there are distinct mechanisms ( e.g . invasive , inflammatory , non-inflammatory ) by which pathogens cause clinical symptoms . Similarly , probiotic effects are exerted through multiple modes-of-action ( e.g . direct antimicrobial activity , competitive exclusion , immune response stimulation , inhibition of virulence gene or protein expression ) . The simultaneous evaluation of pathogen-specific effects on clinical , microbiological and immunological levels has not previously been performed . The knowledge gained through this multi-faceted approach will inform understanding of the probiotic-host-pathogen interactions that are responsible for improved clinical outcomes in children with AGE . Our study population , outpatient children , is both the main group of patients who suffer from AGE as well as the main consumer of probiotics . Thus , our findings will be relevant and ready for translation into clinical care while simultaneously opening up avenues for future research . The principal questions to be addressed are as follows : Hypotheses : In children aged 3-48 months presenting to an ED with less than 72 hours of AGE like symptoms , compared with placebo , the administration of a probiotic agent : Will result in a significantly lower proportion of children developing moderate to severe disease over the subsequent 2 weeks . Will not be associated with a significantly greater occurrence of minor side effects . Will be associated with a greater increase in secretory IgA ( sIgA ) . Will have varying effects based on the etiologic pathogen , given the diverse underlying pathophysiologic processes induced by the causative agents and the multiple mechanisms of action of probiotics . Clinical Efficacy : Primary Question : For previously healthy children , ages 3-48 months , who present to an ED with less than 72 hours of AGE like symptoms , is the proportion who develop moderate to severe disease [ Modified Vesikari Score ( MVS ) ≥ 9 ] following ED evaluation , significantly different in those who receive a probiotic agent ( Lacidofil ) compared to those who receive placebo ? Secondary Questions : In this group of patients , amongst those receiving active treatment versus placebo : Is there a difference in the ( a ) duration of diarrhea or ( b ) duration of vomiting ? Is there a difference in the proportion who require an unscheduled health care provider visit ? Is there a difference in the effectiveness of treatment based on the infecting pathogen ? Side Effect Profile : Question : In this group of patients , is the proportion that experiences a side effect ( e.g . bloating , fever , abdominal distention , rash ) significantly different in those who receive Lacidofil compared to placebo ? Mechanism of Action : Question : In this group of patients , are fecal sIgA levels 5 days and 4 weeks after the initiation of treatment higher in those who receive Lacidofil compared to those who receive placebo ? Microbiologic - Stool Pathogen-Specific Load : Question : In this group of patients , is there a difference in the pathogen specific reduction in stool pathogen load in those who receive Lacidofil compared to those who receive placebo ?",2013-05-09,"February 28, 2018","Inclusion Criteria : Presence of diarrhea : defined as ≥ 3 watery stools in a 24-hour period Duration of vomiting and/or diarrhea < 72 hours Age 3 to < 48 months Exclusion Criteria : Presence of an indwelling vascular access line or structural heart disease Taking immunosuppressive therapy , or known history of immunodeficiency Hematochezia in the preceding 72 hours , underlying significant chronic gastrointestinal problem or inflammatory bowel disease Family member with an indwelling vascular access line , on immunosuppressive therapy , or with a known immunodeficiency Bilious vomiting Probiotic use ( supplement ) in the preceding 2 weeks Previously enrolled in this trial Daily follow-up not possible Allergy to Soy Pre-existing ( known ) pancreatic dysfunction or insufficiency Oral or Gastrointestinal surgery within preceding 7 days",886,0,3 Months,48 Months

Turku University Hospital,NCT01854489,Effects of Rifampicin on the Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Sublingual and Intravenous Buprenorphine,Turku University Hospital,4,1,Healthy,Drug,Placebo,Basic Science,Single,This study is aimed to examine the possible interactions of sublingual and intravenous buprenorphine with rifampicin .,"Variability in drug response can be due to either pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic factors . The reasons why people differ in pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics are manifold and include , e.g. , genetic factors , diseases , age and concomitantly administered drugs . Oxidation reactions are dominant in the metabolism of drugs and cytochrome P-450 enzymes ( CYP ) have been recognized as chief contributors . We have previously shown that drug interactions mediated by the inhibition of CYP enzymes may be of major clinical significance.Buprenorphine is a semisynthetic partial µ-opioid receptor agonist . In low doses , it is used in the treatment of moderate acute and chronic pain whereas in high doses , it is used in the management of opioid withdrawal symptoms and opioid addiction . It has high affinity for the µ-opioid receptor and its analgesic efficacy is 20-40 times that of morphine . It acts as an antagonist at the myy-opioid receptor and as an agonist at the myy-opioid receptor and opioid-like receptor ( ORL-1 ) . Buprenorphine undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism and has low oral bioavailability of 15 % . Bioavailability following sublingual administration of buprenorphine is higher , 50-60 % . After high sublingual doses of buprenorphine ( 8-24 mg ) , peak plasma concentrations are reached in 1 hour and after low sublingual doses ( 0.4 mg ) they are reached in approximately 3 h. Approximately two-thirds of a buprenorphine dose is excreted unchanged , and the rest is metabolized in the liver and intestinal wall . N-dealkylation of buprenorphine mainly via CYP3A but also CYP2C8 yields norbuprenorphine , and glucuronidation yields buprenorphine-3-glucuronide . Norbuprenorphine is excreted in the urine after subsequent conjugation . 80-90 % of buprenorphine is excreted by the biliary system and enterohepatic circulation.Although few interaction studies of high-dose buprenorphine and antiretrovirals have been conducted , the effect of CYP3A inducers on the pharmacokinetics of low-dose buprenorphine is unknown . Because the use of buprenorphine in pain management is increasing after the introduction of transdermal buprenorphin patches to the market , it is clinically relevant to study and quantify possible interactions of buprenorphine with inducers of its CYP3A-mediated metabolism such as rifampicin .",2013-04-27,"November 19, 2014","Inclusion Criteria : non-smoking aged 18-40 years body weights within ±15 % of the ideal weight for height Exclusion Criteria A previous history of intolerance to the study drugs or to related compounds and additives .

Nationwide Children's Hospital,NCT01933243,Treatment of Anxiety and Anorexia Nervosa in Adolescents,Andrea Bonny,2,1,Anxiety,Drug,Fish oil,Treatment,Quadruple,"Adolescents with anorexia nervosa frequently have associated anxiety , and standard medications used for anxiety are unhelpful when patients are malnourished . This is a 12 week trial examining the safety , tolerability , and effectiveness of fish oil nutritional supplements for anxiety in adolescents with anorexia nervosa .","Anorexia nervosa ( AN ) is an eating disorder characterized by a morbid fear of weight gain and a perception of being overweight despite objective evidence of weight loss and malnutrition . It has been estimated that almost 0.9 % of women will suffer from AN at some point in their lives , and most cases of AN arise during adolescence . Even with appropriate treatment , only about half of patients with AN will have a full recovery , 30 % partial recovery , and 20 % will progress to having a chronic illness . Earlier , more aggressive treatment with appropriate nutritional recovery during adolescence offers the best chance of a full recovery . Treatment of AN is complicated by the high rate of comorbid psychiatric diagnoses , the physical and cognitive effects of the attendant malnutrition , and the lack of effective pharmacologic interventions . Approximately 75 % of patients with AN have a comorbid psychiatric illness , including depression , obsessive compulsive disorder , and anxiety . Anxiety disorders in particular share attributes with AN , including perfectionism , rigidity , compulsivity , and harm avoidance in addition to trait anxiety . Complicating treatment , the risk and severity of patients ' anxiety is enhanced by a lower body mass index ( BMI ) , and this low BMI is the likely reason why standard medication treatments for generalized anxiety , such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are ineffective . In order to address these treatment challenges , we propose to study the tolerability , feasibility and efficacy of a non-pharmacologic interventions for anxiety in adolescents with AN : omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid ( PUFA ) supplementation . Over the past 15 years , there has been an interest in possible associations between fish oil and affective illness , particularly depression . Low plasma levels of docosahexaenoic acid , an essential fatty acid found in fish oil , are associated with low concentrations of cerebrospinal fluid 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid ( 5-HIAA ) , a marker of central nervous system serotonin turnover . Epidemiologically , those populations with higher fish oil consumption tend to have lower rates of depression , and reported low levels of fish consumption have been associated with a greater risk of depression in women . It has been hypothesized that omega-3 PUFAs alter brain phospholipid composition and enhance membrane fluidity , and this is supported by evidence that supplementation with omega-3 PUFAs decreases brain water proton transverse relaxation times in patients with bipolar disorder . The association with depression and the proposed mechanism of action elicited some interest regarding associations between omega-3 PUFAs and anxiety disorders . Supplementation trials have shown mixed results , with no effects for obsessive compulsive disorder in patients taking maximum doses of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors , and another showing decreased anxiety symptoms in 22 patients enrolled in a substance abuse treatment program . Recently , Kiecolt-Glaser and colleagues described a decrease in test-related anxiety symptoms in a non-clinical sample of medical students related to supplementation with omega-3 PUFAs . Although there has been some interest in the use of omega-3 PUFA supplementation as an adjunctive treatment for anorexia nervosa , there have been no systematic trials .",2013-08-09,"March 23, 2018","Inclusion Criteria : Females admitted to Nationwide Children 's Hospital Eating Disorder Partial Hospitalization Program Exclusion Criteria : Inability to take pills Co-morbid medical conditions affecting appetite and weight ( e.g. , inflammatory bowel disease , cancer , cystic fibrosis ) Co-morbid psychiatric conditions affecting appetite and weight ( e.g. , bipolar disorder , substance abuse ) Currently taking fish oil supplements Inability to participate in study for 12 consecutive weeks .",24,0,12 Years,21 Years
Hadassah Medical Organization,NCT01934868,Prolotherapy Versus Epidural Steroid Injections (ESI) for Lumbar Pain Radiating to the Leg,Hadassah Medical Organization,4,1,Sciatica,Drug,prolotherapy solution of 20% dextrose,Treatment,,"The hypothesis is that in the treatment of low back pain ( LBP ) radiating to the leg , the long-term results of prolotherapy are more effective than those of the current conventional treatment : epidural steroid injections ( ESI ) . This research will examine the efficacy of prolotherapy injections versus epidural steroid injections for the treatment of low back pain radiating to the leg . This is a randomized , unblinded study , in which patients seen in the principle investigator 's pain clinic will be randomly divided to receive treatments from either the experimental , prolotherapy group , or the active control , ESI group .","The primary goal of the study is to investigate the long-term efficacy of prolotherapy for patients with LBP referring to the leg . The secondary goal is to compare this efficacy with that of epidural steroids . The reason for exploring options other than ESI is that the latter have proved to be disappointing . Comprehensive reviews have been written on interlaminar and transforaminal epidurals which basically show poor long-term results of longer than 3 months . In addition , ESI carries risks of neurological damage , epidural hematoma and infection . However , ESI continues to be the most widely used treatment worldwide . Research also shows that with increasing age , there is an increased incidence of ligament laxity , spondylolisthesis and angulation which may in turn lead to nerve impingement and deterioration in function with time . Sprained and strained ligaments are themselves capable of referring pain down the leg even as far as the ankle . Research shows that much of the pain referred down the leg is not from impinged nerve roots but from other soft tissues , such as the above-mentioned ligaments ; these must be addressed and treated not only to treat pain but in order to improve function . The term prolotherapy is otherwise known as proliferative regeneration therapy and is aimed at doing just the opposite of cortisone , namely , to strengthen the structures injected , usually ligaments . Prolotherapy solutions are also used to treat partially torn tendons , as in the case of partial rotator cuff tears . Research on prolotherapy has shown that this treatment mode produces varying results in the treatment of low back pain and carries fewer risks than epidurals . One can infer from this that it may provide a safer and better long-term treatment method than ESI . Yelland 's review shows that prolotherapy works for the treatment of LBP if this treatment method is combined with other measures such as exercises or manipulations . In this study , patients with low back pain radiating to the leg will be randomized to receive either epidural steroid injections or prolotherapy injections using a solution made up of 20 % dextrose . In light of the results of the research quoted , it was decided to give exercise instructions tailored to every patient 's condition . Both patients from the experimental and the control groups will receive this instruction in order to avoid the presence of another confounding variable . A precondition to being included in the trial is having either a CT or MRI of the lumbar spine within the previous 18 months and not having any of the exclusion criteria cited below . Once included in the trial , patients will be randomized into the study and control groups . All epidural injections will be performed under fluoroscopy , and radiocontrast dye will be injected to verify that the injectate will be given in the correct place . Patients in this group will receive 3 interlaminar epidural steroid injections approximately 4 weeks apart . The solution injected will be made up of 80mg methylprednisolone acetate with bupivacaine . The level injected will depend on the clinical picture . All of the prolotherapy dextrose injections will be performed under ultrasound guidance . Prolotherapy patients will receive 5 sessions approximately 4 weeks apart . In each session , 6 injections in different areas of the lumbosacral spine and sacroiliac ligaments will be injected with 20 % dextrose solution using a 25 gauge spinal needle . The targeted structures include the following : the facet joint capsular ligaments , interspinous ligaments , and some of the sacroiliac ligaments , depending on the clinical assessment . The clinical picture will determine what levels will be injected in each session . As described below , patients will be assessed prior to the study and after the study regarding their pain and function . Because several patients fail to improve and continue to suffer from severe pain , it was considered unethical to keep patients in their original grouping and prevent crossover for a period of 12 months . Crossover will be permitted if all of the following conditions apply : At least 1 month has passed since the last treatment in the original allocation group NRS pain levels are at least 6 out of 10 Pain and function have not improved with the originally allocated treatment The patient requests the crossover . Participants will receive the same treatments in the crossover groups as patients who were originally allocated to those groups Therefore , patients who cross over to the epidural side will receive up to 3 epidural injections approximately 1 month apart . Participants who cross over to the prolotherapy grouping will receive up to 5 treatment sessions also approximately 1 month apart . Follow-up of crossover participants will also be performed in the same manner and by the same independent investigator as for non-cross-over participants at 1 , 3 , 6 and 12 months after the last crossover treatment .",2013-08-30,"June 28, 2023","Inclusion Criteria : Pain radiating down one or both legs or to the groin of at least 12 weeks ' duration Patients with disc lesions with radiating pain to the leg ( s ) Mild spinal stenosis Exclusion Criteria : History of back surgery Recent history ( less than 2 years ) of active malignancy Recent fracture in the lumbar spine or pelvis of less than 12 months Active locus of infection in the body Coagulation disorders , and current anticoagulation therapy , excluding aspirin Chronic medication with corticosteroids and NSAIDS ( which are said to possibly neutralise the effect of prolotherapy ) - the latter must be stopped 24 hours prior to the first treatment session Recent injection of cortisone for back pain or any other pathology elsewhere in the body- patients must wait 2 weeks before commencement of the study Concurrent significant depressive illness or evidence of catastrophisation , fibromyalgia Concurrent history of active autoimmune disease or inflammatory joint disease evidence of a peripheral neuropathy NOTE : If any of the above illnesses appear during the time of the treatment in any patient , the patient will be withdrawn from the trial as treatment may be detrimental to his or her health .

Duke University,NCT01930123,"Impact of Fructose on Metabolism, Energy Homeostasis and Magnetic Resonance Biomarkers in Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease",Manal F Abdelmalek,2,0,Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD),Drug,intravenous fructose challenge,Supportive Care,,"This study will advance several goals of the NIH Action Plan : 1 ) establish a multidisciplinary team to develop quantitative methodologies and imaging protocols for liver , 2 ) validate diagnostic criteria and methodologies for imaging in liver in both a cross-sectional and a longitudinal dietary intervention study of patients with Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease ( NAFLD ) , 3 ) create a liver tissue bank with correlative imaging data , 4 ) develop reliable non-invasive MR markers to distinguish simple steatosis from Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis ( NASH ) , and 5 ) define the dynamic changes in metabolism , energy homeostasis , and MR biomarkers as they relate to fructose-related liver injury .","Like obesity , NAFLD and NASH are closely linked to nutrition and the `` Western diet '' which is rich in saturated fats and refined sugars . Although fat consumption has remained relatively stable , the marked increase in dietary fructose consumption ( more than doubling in the past 30 years alone ) supports the role of fructose in NAFLD and the metabolic syndrome . Although the mechanism ( s ) for fructose-related liver injury is not yet well defined , fructose-related hepatic adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) depletion may contribute to liver injury . Observations in animals suggest that fructose induces metabolic syndrome and NAFLD independent of energy intake . One key difference in fructose metabolism ( as opposed to glucose ) relates to ATP depletion and the necessity of adenosine monophosphate ( AMP ) kinase to replenish ATP stores . As opposed to glucose , initial fructose metabolism involves phosphorylation of fructose to fructose-1-phosphate by fructokinase ( ketohexokinase , KHK ) using the substrate ATP . Unlike glucokinase , the phosphorylation of fructose by KHK is specific for fructose and not rate limited . Replenishment of ATP stores requires phosphorylation of AMP back to ATP via AMP kinase ( which is inhibited in insulin resistance ( common in patients with NAFLD ) or conversion to uric acid via xanthine dehydrogenase resulting in hyperuricemia . The high activity of KHK in phosphorylating fructose to fructose-1-phosphate in the liver , could result in hepatic ATP depletion with habitual fructose consumption . Published animal and human studies support our hypothesis that fructose is a risk factor for NAFLD and NAFLD-related liver disease progression . In animal models , diets high in fructose induce features of the metabolic syndrome including weight gain , insulin resistance , hypertriglyceridemia , and hypertension . Similar effects are not observed with the administration of other simple sugars such as glucose . Fructose ( or sucrose ) administration to humans also causes features of metabolic syndrome which are quite typical of patients with NAFLD . Fructose is lipogenic , stimulates triglyceride synthesis and causes hepatic steatosis . As previously reported in animals , our group reported that increased fructose consumption ( assessed as fructose-containing beverages only ) is a risk factor of metabolic syndrome and biopsy-proven NAFLD and that patients with NAFLD consume 3-4 times more fructose than age , gender , and mass index ( BMI ) matched controls without liver disease . In addition to increased fructose consumption being a risk factor for NAFLD , fructose has been implicated in NAFLD disease progression . The administration of a diet with 25 % of total energy as sucrose ( which contains 50 % fructose ) resulted in a rise in liver aminotransferase levels within 18 days . This study , performed nearly 25 years ago , is all the more alarming as current sugar intake of Americans is in this same range . In our study of 427 patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD , increased consumption of fructose-containing beverages was univariately associated with decreased age ( P < 0.0001 ) , male sex ( P < 0.0001 ) , hypertriglyceridemia ( P < 0.04 ) , low high density lipoprotein ( HDL ) cholesterol ( < 0.0001 ) , decreased serum glucose ( P < 0.001 ) , increased calorie intake ( P < 0.0001 ) , and hyperuricemia ( P < 0.0001 ) . After controlling for age , sex , BMI , and total calorie intake , daily fructose consumption was associated with lower steatosis grade and higher fibrosis stage ( P < 0.05 for each ) . Being that triglyceride synthesis requires ATP , we hypothesize that lower hepatic steatosis may reflect deceased ATP availability . Additionally , in older adults ( age ≥ 48 years ) , daily fructose consumption was associated with increased hepatic inflammation ( P < 0.05 ) , and hepatocyte ballooning ( P < 0.05 ) . However , the mechanism ( s ) by which fructose causes liver injury remains unknown . In support of our hypothesis that ATP depletion underlies liver injury in patients with NAFLD , our group has demonstrated that patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD have increased hepatic mRNA ( messenger ribonucleic acid ) expression of KHK compared to matched controls . Indeed , in human pilot studies , intravenous ( IV ) fructose administration is associated with hepatic ATP depletion which can be assessed by 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) . Reduced hepatic ATP stores are more prevalent in overweight and obese subjects than in lean subjects . Furthermore , recovery from fructose-induced ATP depletion was found to be delayed in patients with NAFLD ( n=8 ) . However , a limitation to this existing work is the small sample size and the inability to assess a cause-effect relationship ( s ) between BMI , NAFLD , energy homeostasis , and histologic features of liver injury . In liver cells , ATP depletion could perpetuate chronic liver injury by making fatty hepatocytes less proliferative . Hepatic ATP depletion also encourages the expansion of liver progenitor populations , causes arrest in protein synthesis , induces inflammatory and prooxidative changes , increases endoplasmic reticulum stress , promotes activation of stress-related kinases , induces mitochondrial dysfunction , and increases apoptotic activity . This supporting data suggests that fructose may be associated with NAFLD , NASH , and progressive fibrosis . Further , a study by Loguercio et al . demonstrated that increased uric acid levels above the basal level after IV fructose infusion was significantly higher ( p < 0.01 ) in patients with cirrhosis ( 3 mg/dl ) and NASH ( 1.9 mg/dl ) than in healthy controls ( 1.2 mg/dl ) . This effect was completely reversed by fructose 1,6-diphosphate which could replenish the ability to resynthesize ATP ( adenosine triphosphate ) from ADP ( adenosine diphosphate ) . Therefore , an IV fructose challenge could effectively differentiate healthy subjects , from chronic hepatitis , from cirrhosis . NAFLD lacks accurate and robust non-invasive biomarkers to grade and stage histologic disease activity . This is a critical barrier to understanding the influence of this important environmental risk factor ( increased/habitual fructose consumption ) on the pathogenesis and progression of NAFLD . Currently , reliable assessment NAFLD requires liver biopsy and interpretation of histology . Serum aminotransferase levels and conventional imaging methods can detect liver fat but can not grade or stage NAFLD . Furthermore , current developments in biomarker are cross-sectional in nature and do not characterize the dynamic changes which underlie liver injury in patients with NAFLD . In vivo 31P MRS permits the evaluation of dynamic changes of individual phosphorus-containing metabolites in the liver parenchyma , such as phosphomonoester ( PME ) , ATP , and inorganic phosphate ( Pi ) . Intravenous fructose load alters phosphorus metabolites and allows assessment of liver function by 31P MRS. Other investigators have demonstrated that fructose loading could be used effectively as a tool to investigate change in metabolic steps of hepatic metabolism in humans with alcohol-related liver disease . Further , IV fructose loading causes significantly higher ATP degradation and uric acid production in cirrhotic patients than in healthy controls . The associations between fructose , increased uric acid , and hepatic ATP depletion has been previously described . Increased uric acid is an independent risk factor for NAFLD and in keeping with our hypothesis , hyperuricemia may be a surrogate marker of impaired hepatic energy homeostasis in patients with NAFLD . The proposed mechanism for fructose-related hepatic ATP depletion , NAFLD , NASH and the associated hyperuricemia is depicted in Figure 1 is novel , innovative , scientifically rigorous and address an important public health concern-the impact of fructose on the rising epidemic of NAFLD .",2013-08-23,"August 9, 2022","Inclusion Criteria : Patients must satisfy all of the following criteria to be eligible for enrollment : Age greater than 18 years as of the initial screening interview and provision of consent Healthy control as defined by : normal liver aminotransferases AND no evidence of NAFLD on radiologic imaging studies AND no history of chronic liver disease OR liver biopsy ( if one had been historically performed for evaluation of suspected liver disease ) .

"University Hospital, Rouen",NCT01931605,Results of Selective Prostatic Arterial Embolization in Patients With Indwelling Urinary Catheter Due to Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia Refractory to Medical Treatment.,"University Hospital, Rouen",3,0,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,Device,Prostatic arterial embolization using BeadBlock (Terumo),Treatment,,"Background : Patients with indwelling urinary catheter for chronic retention due to obstructive BPH refractory to medical therapy are candidates for prostatectomy still considered as the gold standard of treatment . Urinary tract infection , strictures , postoperative pain , incontinence , sexual dysfunction , anesthesiologist risk and blood loss are complications associated with surgery . Minimally invasive treatments were originally conceived as an attempt to offer equivalent efficacy without the burden and risk of operative morbidity . Recently , it was suggested that prostatic arterial embolization ( PAE ) to treat BPH might follow uterine artery embolization for uterine leiomyomas . Animal studies in pigs and dogs have shown that PAE is safe and can induce prostatic volume reduction . The first report of this technique in the management of BPH in humans was by DeMeritt et al , who reported a single case of BPH with obstructive symptoms and blood loss refractory to other treatments that was successfully managed by PAE with polyvinyl alcohol ( PVA ) particles . Objective : We investigate whether PAE might be a feasible procedure as an alternative treatment option to treat urinary retention due to obstructive BPH . The primary objective is to evaluate the success rate of procedure defined when selective prostatic arterial catheterization and embolization were achieve and patients can be able to urinate after their urinary catheter has been removed . Patients and methods : A monocentric prospective study is undertaken in 25 patients aged 50-85 years who present with indwelling urinary catheter due to obstructive BPH refractory to medical treatment with a clinical indication for surgery who agreed to undergo PAE . The study is approved by the hospital ethical committee and an informed consent form for PAE as an alternative treatment is signed by all participants . Statistical analysis : The sample size has been calculated in order to have an estimated probability of success ( corresponding of primary objective ) of 50 % ( worst case ) with 95 % confidence intervals of 30 to 70 . The two-sample t-test ( and Wilcoxon rank-sum test ) is used to compare the mean changes of the variables from baseline to 10 , 30 and 90 days . Finally , the Chi-square test is used to test for adverse events at the end of follow-up . P ≤ 0.05 is indicative of statistically significant .","Embolization is performed under local anesthesia in one day surgery unit by unilateral approach , usually the right femoral artery . Initially , pelvic angiography is performed to evaluate the iliac and prostatic arteries . Then , a 5-F catheter is introduced in right femoral artery to catheterize the left hypogastric artery and reach its anterior division . The inferior vesical artery and finally the prostatic vessels are selectively catheterized with a 3-F coaxial microcatheter . For embolization , nonspherical 100-300 μm PVA particles is used . The endpoint chosen for embolization is slow flow or near-stasis in the prostatic vessels with interruption of the arterial flow and prostatic gland opacification . When embolization of the left prostatic arteries was finished , the right prostatic arteries were embolized in the same way . Urinary catheter is removed 10 days after the embolization procedure . Voiding trials is performed and the successfull urination after urethral catheter removal is defined as three consecutive spontaneous micturitions with postvoid residual less than 100 % of each micturition volume . If the patient is unable to urinate , a urethral catheter will replace before hospitalization discharge and the patient will return to our outpatient clinic for another voiding trial until the end of protocol . Assessments were carried out 10 , 30 and 90 days after initial embolization allocation .",2013-07-04,"July 29, 2015","Inclusion Criteria : Patients with a urinary retention due to obstructive benign prostatic hyperplasia ( BPH ) confirmed by endoscopy , Patients aged 50-85 years , Patients with indwelling urinary catheter for at least 1 month , Patients with at least one failure of a trial without catheter despite alpha-blocker treatment for at least 72 hours , Patients informed about alternative treatment ( transurethral resection of the prostate , laser prostatectomy , prostatic adenomectomy ) , Patients signed an informed consent form .

St. Louis University,NCT01874119,Fosaprepitant for N/V With High-dose Interleukin-2 for Metastatic Melanoma and Renal Cell Carcinoma,St. Louis University,2,0,Chemotherapy-induced Nausea and Vomiting,Drug,Fosaprepitant,Treatment,Triple,"The purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of intravenous fosaprepitant therapy to reduce nausea and vomiting during the treatment of high dose interleukin-2 ( HD IL-2 ) therapy for metastatic melanoma or metastatic renal cell carcinoma . Fosaprepitant is an intravenous ( IV ) medication that is FDA- approved for use in adults for the prevention of nausea and vomiting during chemotherapy . Fosaprepitant works by blocking the neurokinin-1 receptor , which is a receptor in the brain that is known to cause nausea and vomiting . Past studies estimate that up to 70 % of patients undergoing treatment with HD IL-2 will have nausea and/or vomiting . While fosaprepitant has been used in clinical practice to treat nausea and vomiting during HD IL-2 , there have not been any studies done to see how well it works . All patients will receive treatment ( IV fosaprepitant ) during the study during either the first or second hospital admission for HD IL-2 . On the admission that the subject is not receiving IV fosaprepitant , the subject will receive placebo ( a medicine that looks like fosaprepitant , but is not active ) . The study is double-blinded , which means neither the subject , nor the study doctor will know to which group you have been assigned to that admission ( IV fosaprepitant or placebo ) . This study design was chosen to limit the potential for bias , which means the trial was designed to try to ensure that unknown factors do not affect trial results . When patients start the study , patients will be randomly assigned to one of two groups : those who receive treatment ( IV fosaprepitant ) first and those who receive placebo first . During the first admission , subjects will be given the IV fosaprepitant or IV placebo during admission . During the second admission , subjects will 'crossover ' and receive the other treatment that they did not receive during the first admission . Improvement in nausea and vomiting will be assessed by counting the number of nausea and vomiting episodes , recording if the subject needs additional medication for nausea and vomiting , and by using patient questionnaires .","This is a Phase 2B double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study evaluating the efficacy of intravenous fosaprepitant for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in patients undergoing high-dose interleukin-2 ( HD IL-2 ) therapy ( 720,000 IU/kg per dose intravenously ; 14 doses , 2 cycles per course ) for metastatic melanoma and metastatic renal cell carcinoma . A total of 22 subjects will be enrolled in the study . On study entry , patients will be randomized to receive either IV fosaprepitant ( 150 mg on Day 1 , Day 3 , or Day 5 ) or matched placebo during first admission of HD IL-2 therapy ( cycle 1 ) . All subjects will crossover and receive the opposite treatment during cycle 2 . All patients will receive ondansetron 24 mg by mouth daily per standard protocol every 24 hours during Days 1-5 of admission starting 30 minutes prior to first dose of HD IL-2 . During the treatment phase , subjects will receive Patients will receive IV fosaprepitant 30 minutes before first dose of HD IL-2 therapy and every 48 hours until completion of HD IL-2 therapy . Upon study entry , the subjects will be given a dairy to report episodes of vomiting , use of rescue therapy , and nausea assessments using the 1-100 scale within the visual analogue scale ( VAS ) . The subject will be instructed to complete entries from baseline assessment ( prior to first dose ) until 5 days after last dose of HD IL-2 for endpoint analysis . During inpatient admissions , subjects will complete diary entries before each dose ( q8 hours ) . As an outpatient , subjects will complete diary entries on a daily basis . Recording of whether or not pruritus was observed will also be collected within the subject diary . If a patient reports pruritus , the severity of pruritus on the 1-100 scale visual analogue scale ( VAS ) will also be collected . The study team will record any episodes of vomiting and the use of rescue therapy and ensure completion of patient diary during inpatient portion .

Johns Hopkins University,NCT01875185,Hormones Inflammation and Thrombosis,Johns Hopkins University,4,0,Acute Coronary Syndrome,Drug,Aspirin 81 mg,Diagnostic,,The investigators are attempting to determine if the response to aspirin in women is related to the level of estrogen and progesterone that a woman has .,"Thrombosis plays a significant role in both acute coronary syndromes ( ACS ) and early saphenous vein graft ( SVG ) failure . Women with coronary heart disease have higher levels of the inflammatory mediator thromboxane , which is produced by platelets , monocytes , macrophages and the endothelium . Data show that higher levels of urinary thromboxane ( UTXB2 ) are associated with SVG failure 6 months after Coronary Artery Bypass Graft ( CABG ) . Women in the study cohort had higher levels of UTXB2 and higher odds of graft failure when compared to men . The elevated urinary thromboxane seen in the women in our study cohort may represent a marker and/or an etiology of thrombosis . Are the levels of UTXB2 higher in women due to hormonal differences ? In a prior pilot study we investigated whether hormonal levels are associated with changes in urinary thromboxane . We looked at hormonal and urinary thromboxane levels in 48 postmenopausal and 52 premenopausal women . We found that postmenopausal women had higher levels of UTXB2 than did premenopausal women ( 2495 vs. 2299 , p=.02 ) and that in premenopausal women a higher estrogen/progesterone ratio was associated with the highest levels of urinary thromboxane . The goal of the current study is to measure the response to seven days of aspirin administration as it relates to urinary thromboxane levels in pre and post-menopausal women . With this study we will be able to examine the change in UTXB2 comparing the premenopausal to post menopausal women . We will also be able to see if the change in UTXB2 in response to aspirin is affected by hormone levels in the premenopausal women . Lastly this study will provide reference data for more far-reaching studies exploring how global changes in hormonal balance ( as seen in pregnancy or menopause ) or in the level of inflammation ( as seen in aging or with Coronary Artery Disease ( CAD ) risk factors ) , affect UTXB2 and platelet hyperreactivity .",2013-06-07,"April 2, 2018","Inclusion Criteria : Women age 18-80 Signed informed consent .

The safety of this treatment will also be studied . The process of changing the DNA ( the genetic material in cells ) of these T-cells is called `` gene transfer . '' Researchers want to learn if these genetically-changed T-cells are effective in attacking cancer cells in patients with leukemia , MDS , lymphoma , Hodgkin disease , or MM , after they have received an allogeneic stem cell transplant . The chemotherapy you will be given on study is fludarabine , melphalan , and alemtuzumab . These drugs are designed to stop the growth of cancer cells , which may cause the cancer cells to die . This chemotherapy is also designed to block your body 's ability to reject the donor 's stem cells . Researchers also want to learn if giving AP1903 will help the symptoms of graft-versus-host disease ( GvHD ) that may occur after the T-cell infusion . GvHD occurs when donor cells attack the cells of the person receiving the stem cell transplant .","Gene Transfer : Gene transfer involves drawing blood from a transplant donor , and then separating out the T-cells using a machine . Researchers then perform a gene transfer to change the T-cells ' DNA , and then inject the changed T-cells into the body of the patient receiving the transplant . Study Drug Administration : You will receive fludarabine , melphalan , and alemtuzumab to kill cancer cells and help prevent your body from rejecting the stem cells . The day you receive the stem cells is called Day 0 . The days before you receive your stem cells are called minus days . The days after you receive the stem cells are called plus days . On Day -7 , you will be admitted to the hospital and given fluids by vein to hydrate you . On Days -6 through -3 , you will receive fludarabine by vein over 1 hour each day . On Day -2 , you will receive melphalan by vein over 30 minutes . On Day -1 , you will receive alemtuzumab by vein over 2 hours . On Day 0 , you will receive the stem cell transplant as a cell infusion by vein . After the transplant , you will receive tacrolimus and methotrexate . At first , you will receive tacrolimus as a continuous ( nonstop ) infusion until you are able to take it by mouth . You will then take tacrolimus by mouth 2 times a day for about 3 weeks and then your doctor will tell you how to taper it off ( gradually stop taking it ) . On Days +1 , +3 , +6 , and +11 , you will receive methotrexate by vein over 30 minutes . You will receive filgrastim as an injection under the skin 1 time a day , starting 1 week after the transplant , until your blood cell levels return to normal . Filgrastim is designed to help with the growth of white blood cells . Between Day +56 and +64 , if you are in stable medical condition and have not developed GvHD , you will receive a donor lymphocyte infusion containing genetically modified T-cells by vein over 10-30 minutes . You will receive Benadryl ( diphenhydramine ) by vein over 15 minutes and Tylenol by mouth before the infusion to lower the risk of an allergic reaction . If your doctor thinks it is needed due to medical problems , the T-cell infusion may be postponed for up to 6 months after the transplant . If you develop symptoms of GvHD after the T-cell infusion , you must return to the clinic within 72 hours . Most cases of GVHD occur within 60 days of the T-cell infusion . If you have GvHD , you will receive AP1903 by vein and possibly steroids by mouth or by vein . If your doctor thinks it is needed , you may receive one more dose of AP1903 by vein 24-72 hours after the first dose . If GvHD returns after the first treatment and your doctor thinks it is needed , you may receive AP1903 by vein and steroids by mouth or by vein . Blood ( about 2 tablespoons each time ) will be drawn about 3 hours before you receive AP1903 , about 2 hours after the AP1903 infusion , and then about 24 hours after the AP1903 infusion to check the level of genetically modified T-cells . You will then come to the clinic every day for the next 3 days and for an additional 3 days after a second dose of AP1903 , if given . In addition , you will come to the clinic on about Days +7 , +14 , +28 , +42 and +56 after receiving AP1903 . If your symptoms do not improve after receiving AP1903 , you will be given standard drugs for GvHD . Study Tests : After the stem cell transplant but before the T-cell infusion , you will have the following tests and procedures to find out if you will be eligible for the T-cell infusion : You will have a physical exam . You will be checked for possible reactions to treatment , including GvHD . Blood ( about 4 tablespoons ) will be drawn for routine tests , to check your liver and kidney function , for chimerism studies ( determination of donor or recipient cells ) , and to check for cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) . If your doctor thinks it is needed , you will have a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy performed to check the status of the disease . To collect a bone marrow aspiration/biopsy , an area of the hip is numbed with anesthetic , and a small amount of bone marrow and bone is withdrawn through a large needle . About twice a week until about 2 months after the T-cell infusion , and then 6 and 12 months after the stem cell transplant : You will have a physical exam , including measurement of your height , weight and vital signs . Your medical history will be recorded . You will have be checked for possible reactions to your treatment , including GvHD . Blood ( about 4 tablespoons ) will be drawn for routine tests , to check your liver and kidney function , and to check for CMV and other infections . Part of the blood may be used for chimerism studies , if your doctor thinks it is needed . If your doctor thinks it is needed , you may have a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy performed to check the status of the disease and for chimerism studies . If your doctor thinks it is needed , some tests and procedures may be repeated more frequently or at different time points during the study . Immune System and T-cell Level Tests : If possible , blood ( about 3 tablespoons ) will be drawn to check the status of the disease and your immune system function : 4 hours after the T-cell infusion , once a week for 1 month after the T-cell infusion , and then at 6 weeks and then about 2 , 3 , 6 , 9 , and 12 months after the T-cell infusion . °Part of the blood sample will be used to check for HAMA at 3 months after the T-cell infusion . Part of the blood drawn will be tested to check the level and function of the infused T-cells . At 3 months after the T-cell infusion , blood ( about 1 teaspoon ) will be drawn to check for HAMA . Questionnaires : You will complete a quality of life questionnaire that will take about 5-10 minutes each time : When you enroll on this study At the time of the T-cell infusion If you develop symptoms of GvHD after the T-cell infusion and receive AP1903 , you will complete the questionnaire before you receive AP1903 , and then about 7 and 14 days after you receive AP1903 . If you do not develop symptoms of GvHD , you will complete a questionnaire about 1 month after the T-cell infusion . Length of Treatment : You will be off study after your 1-year follow-up visit . You will be taken off study early if : not enough donor cells could be collected you were not eligible to receive the T-cell infusion you have graft failure ( the donor cells did not `` take '' ) the disease comes back and needs another treatment you are unable to keep appointments you did not return to the clinic within 72 hours of having symptoms of GvHD your study doctor thinks it is in your best interest If you are taken off study , you will receive standard of care treatment . Long-Term Follow-Up : For safety reasons , the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) requires that patients who receive infusions of stem cells treated with a gene transfer procedure must have long-term follow-up yearly for at least 15 years after receiving the gene transfer . You will have blood tests performed to check to make sure you do not have a type of infection called the replication-competent retrovirus ( RCR ) . For this test , blood ( up to 4 teaspoons each time ) will drawn about 1 , 3 , and 6 months after the T-cell infusion , then once every 6 months for 5 years , and then once a year after that for 10 years . If the RCR test results during the first year after the T-cell infusion show that you do not have the RCR infection , the rest of your leftover blood samples ( left over from RCR testing in Years 2-15 ) will be stored at Bellicum for safety reasons . This is so researchers can study any changes in your blood ( related to RCR ) that may arise in Years 2-15 . You will be asked to sign a separate consent form for a long-term follow-up study , Protocol 2006-0676 . If for any reason you are unable to receive the genetically modified cells , you will not be enrolled on the long-term follow-up study . This is an investigational study . The gene transfer or infusion with genetically-changed T-cells and the drug , AP1903 , are not FDA approved or commercially available for use in this type of disease . They are currently being used for research purposes only . Fludarabine , melphalan , and alemtuzumab are commercially available and FDA approved . Up to 35 patients will take part in this study .

Dana-Farber Cancer Institute,NCT01788631,A Phase II Trial of Regadenoson in Sickle Cell Anemia,Dana-Farber Cancer Institute,2,1,Sickle Cell Anemia,Drug,Regadenoson,Treatment,Triple,"This research study is a Phase II clinical trial , which tests the safety and effectiveness of an investigational drug called Regadenoson ( or Lexiscan ) to learn whether the drug works in treating a specific disease , in this case Sickle Cell Disease ( SCD ) . `` Investigational '' means that the drug is being studied . It also means that the FDA has not yet approved the drug for your type of disease . SCD is an inherited blood disorder that causes the red blood cells to change their shape from a round shape to a half-moon/crescent or sickled shape . People who have SCD have a different type of protein that carries oxygen in their blood ( hemoglobin ) than people without SCD . This different type of hemoglobin makes the red blood cells change into crescent shape under certain conditions . Sickle-shaped cells are a problem because they often get stuck in the blood vessels blocking the flow of blood , and cause inflammation and injury to important areas in the body . Regadenoson ( trade name Lexiscan ) is a drug that may prevent this inflammation and injury caused by the sickle shaped cells . This drug is approved by the FDA to be used as a fast infusion during a heart stress test in people who are unable to exercise enough to put stress on their heart by making the heart beat faster . Regadenoson has been studied as a long infusion at this dose in adults , and no safety issues have been identified ( ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier : NCT01085201 ) . This is the first study to look at patient benefit with the long infusion of the drug . This drug has been used in laboratory experiments and information from those other research studies suggests that this drug may help to protect the body from damage caused by sickle-shaped cells in this research study . In this research study , the investigators are specifically looking to see if Regadenoson is an effective treatment for pain crises and acute chest syndrome in SCD .","If you are willing to participate in this research study you will be asked to undergo some screening tests and procedures to confirm your eligibility . Many of these tests and procedures are likely to be part of regular sickle cell anemia care and may be done even if it turns out that you do not take part in the research study . If you have had some of these tests and procedures recently , they may or may not have to be repeated . The tests and procedures include : a medical history , physical examination , blood tests , blood or urine pregnancy test ( if applicable ) and an electrocardiogram . If these tests show that you are eligible to participate in the research study , you will begin the study treatment . If you do not meet the eligibility criteria , you will not be able to participate in the research study . At the time of screening we will also ask you about your pain level . Because no one knows which of the study options is best , you will be `` randomized '' into one of the study groups : the `` study drug '' group , which will receive Regadenoson , or the `` control '' group , which will receive placebo . Randomization means that you are put into a group by chance . It is like flipping a coin . Neither you nor the research doctor will choose what group you will be in . You will have an equal ( 50/50 ) chance of being placed in either group . Neither you nor the research doctor will know what group you are in . You will be given a study medication and it will contain either Regadenoson or placebo ( fluids with no medicine ) . You will be given one infusion of the study drug while you are admitted to the hospital for a pain crisis . The study drug will be infused with fluids . You will stay in the hospital for at least 3 days and 2 nights . Your infusion will be 48 hours long , followed by a 6-hour observation period . During your infusion , you will receive standard treatment for your pain crisis . The study drug will be given through a separate part of your body from the infusions that are part of your standard treatment . The study drug will not be available after your participation in the study ends . Before the infusion : We will place a small tube in your vein called an IV , which will be used only to infuse the study drug . It will not be used for infusions that are part of standard treatment for your pain crisis . During the study drug infusion , standard treatment will be given through a separate IV . We can use your standard treatment IV or a needle to draw blood for the required blood test . If it is hard to draw blood from your veins , we may ask you if you would like to use a peripherally inserted central catheter ( PICC line ) for your blood draws . A PICC line is a small tube that is placed in a vein in your arm and goes through to a vein in your chest . A chest x-ray is usually done to make sure it is in the right veins . It is your choice to decide whether you would like to use a PICC line . We will record your blood pressure and heart rate every 5-10 minutes , until they have stabilized . We will also ask you about your pain level at the time of your blood test . During the 48 hour infusion : Your heart rate and the amount of oxygen in your blood will be monitored continuously using a device that fits over your finger . We will take about 2-3 teaspoons of blood at 24 and 48 hours after the beginning of your infusion for tests to try to understand how the drug affects your body . We will ask you about your pain level at the time of each blood test . We will take your blood pressure every 30 minutes for the first 2 hours , then every hour for the next two hours , then every 2 hours for the remainder of the infusion . A six hour observation period will take place immediately after the infusion . At this time you will undergo the following : your heart rate and the amount of oxygen in your blood will be monitored continuously with a device that fits over your finger . We will take about 5 teaspoons of blood at the end of the period to try to understand how the study drug affects your body . We will ask you about your pain level at the time of your blood test . We will take your blood pressure every 2 hours for the full duration of the observation period . You may not eat or drink anything that contains caffeine , such as coffee , tea , chocolate or sodas during the infusion and observation periods . We would like to keep track of your medical condition for 30 days after you receive the study drug . We would like to do this by contacting you on the telephone weekly during the 30 days after your participation to see how you are doing .",2013-02-07,"January 10, 2018","Inclusion Criteria : Must have sickle cell anemia confirmed by hemoglobin analysis Must be admitted to hospital for pain or ACS Reliable IV access as determined by the study physician Participants must have the laboratory indices as defined below : Hemoglobin ≥ 5 g/dL Platelets > 100,000/mcL ALT ( SGPT ) < 3 X institutional upper limit of normal Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dL INR ≤2.0 , PTT ≤ 48 seconds Exclusion Criteria : Pregnant or breastfeeding Current physician diagnosis of asthma defined by treatment with systemic corticosteroids within the last 12 months or predicted/current use of asthma controller medications 10 or more hospitalizations for pain in the last 12 months Receiving regularly scheduled transfusions Severe ACS Second or third degree AV block or sinus node dysfunction History of a bleeding diathesis History of clinically overt stroke within 3 years History of severe hypertension not adequately controlled with anti-hypertensive medications Receiving chronic anti-coagulation or anti-platelet therapy History of metastatic cancer Receiving any other study agents or have received a study agent in the past 30 days Uncontrolled intercurrent illness Known HIV Have previously enrolled and received the investigational agent as part of this study Taking medications that may interact with the investigational agent Have previously undergone a hematopoietic stem cell transplant or solid organ transplant",100,0,10 Years,70 Years

Even so , the topic of using bupivacaine to inject the paraspinal musculature of the cervical spine has gained wider recognition over the past year . The topic has been discussed heavily on emergency medicine blogs and podcasts . Additionally , online videos have been posted to educate emergency medicine providers on the injection technique . According to retrospective literature , clinical efficacy was observed with a significant proportion of the patients receiving therapeutic effect .

Imperial College London,NCT01787097,Effect of Symbicort ® on GR in Sputum in COPD,Imperial College London,4,1,Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease,Drug,Symbicort® total dose 400ug/12ug,Basic Science,,"The purpose of the research ( or `` knowledge gap '' this research is designed to fill ) is to understand the science of how the combination therapy of 2 drugs ( inhaled longacting beta-agonists ( LABA ) and inhaled corticosteroids ( ICS ) , which are commonly used in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) patients , is better than each drug alone . ICS and LABA both have antiinflammatory properties; that is , they dampen the inflammation in the cells of the airways in the lungs . The combination of LABA and ICS has also been shown to improve clinical effectiveness in asthma patients . The addition of a LABA to LOW doses of ICS has been shown to be more clinically beneficial in asthma than the use of HIGH doses of ICS alone . This has allowed a reduction in the total ICS dose and minimised the adverse side effects of inhaled corticosteroids . Recent evidence suggests that the use of combination therapy of LABA and ICS may also improve clinical effectiveness in COPD patients . Investigators will address this hypothesis by examining the inflammation cells of COPD direct from the site of disease ( the airways ) by looking at sputum/mucus . This research will build on the existing knowledge of the science of how these drugs work in asthma and COPD and allows us to understand the molecular science , which may support new future drug targets for patients with COPD , which are greatly needed .","Corticosteroids exert their effects by binding to a cytoplasmic glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) . The inactive GR is bound to a protein complex that includes heat shock protein hsp90 , acting as molecular chaperones to prevent the nuclear localisation of unoccupied GR . GR binding to the palindromic promotor induces the transcriptional induction of anti-inflammatory genes such as mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 ( MKP-1 ) and secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor ( SLPI ) . GR-steroid complex also binds to negative GRE sequences , resulting in inhibition of pro-inflammatory mediators , such as IL-6 . More importantly , GR binds transcription factor with recruitment of histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) and inhibits wide range of pro-inflammatory cytokines . By this process of transrepression , corticosteroids reduce such pro-inflammatory cytokines as tumour necrosis-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) and interleukin-8 ( IL-8 ) in asthmatic patients whereas they are far less effective in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) patients . The combination of inhaled corticosteroids ( ICS ) and long acting beta 2-agonists ( LABAs ) has been shown to improve clinical effectiveness and anti-inflammatory properties in asthma . The addition of a LABA to low dose ICS has been shown to be more clinically beneficial in asthma than the use of high dose ICS , allowing a reduction in ICS dose and minimising and adverse side effects of corticosteroids . Recent evidence suggests that this may also be the case in COPD . ICS such as budesonide , beclomethasone and fluticasone have been used in combination with LABA 's such as formoterol and salmeterol . These combination treatments are established in national guidelines for treating patients with asthma and also , COPD . The combination of formoterol and budesonide ( Symbicort ® , Astra Zeneca ) will be studied in this project . Evidence suggests that LABAs enhance GR function in vitro . In an asthmatics study , the combination of formoterol and budesonide ( Symbicort ® , Astra Zeneca ) was as effective as high dose ICS on GR activation , gene transactivation and transrepression . However , the precise mechanisms for this enhanced effectiveness are unknown , although priming of the steroid receptor ( GR ) by LABAs may be important . Investigators have developed a novel method of measuring GR-GRE binding activity in sputum using an enzyme immunosorbent assay system . This method , together with the measurements of some functional readouts , will help us to understand some of the mechanisms of steroid and GR interactions using non-invasive methods of assessment of the airways . This may provide insight into the mechanisms of corticosteroid action and whether the addition of a LABA to ICS can alter molecular patterns , which may explain the observed beneficial action of combination therapy seen in patient studies in vivo . This may allow a scientific basis to explore future drug interactions that may be helpful in patients , particularly those patients whose disease tends to be severe and may be unresponsive to standard therapies for COPD and/or where high dose ICS have little beneficial clinical effect and have led to side-effects .",2013-02-04,"October 30, 2020","Inclusion Criteria : Patients ( n=30 ) with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) with mild-to-moderate disease severity ( GOLD 1 and 2 guidelines ) .

Previous studies have shown that high levels of persistent systemic inflammation predict the development of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases in HIV-infected persons on cART ( a group at very high risk of atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction ) . Bydureon has demonstrated potent anti-inflammatory effects in prior studies of non-HIV infected persons , which suggests that this agent may represent a unique and preferred medication for the treatment of insulin resistance in HIV-infected adults . The Investigators hypothesize that short-term ( 16 weeks ) therapy with Bydureon will improve glucose tolerance and significantly reduce circulating plasma levels of interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) and highly-sensitive C-reactive protein ( hsCRP ) , two biomarkers strongly implicated in the development of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases in diabetic , HIV-infected , cART-treated adults .",No further information .

Despite maximal calorie intake , sixty percent of very low birth weight infants still fail to thrive suggesting that factors other than total calorie intake are important in ensuring consistent weight gain . Several reports have indicated a positive sodium balance is critical in ensuring good weight gain in very low birth weight infants , however these infants are susceptible to low serum sodium concentrations . Urine sodium values are sometimes used to diagnosis of hyponatremia or negative sodium balance after the first two weeks of life , but there is no evidence for this practice in preterm neonates . Our central hypothesis is that early supplementation with sodium will ensure positive sodium balance in very low birth weight infants and will result in optimal weight gain and enhanced long term outcomes . Secondarily we hypothesize that low sodium concentrations in the urine will not correlate with low serum sodium values .","This is a randomized , blinded , placebo-controlled trial in infants born at less than 32 weeks gestation , who are admitted to the Newborn Intensive Care Unit at University of Cincinnati Medical Center , Cincinnati , Ohio . Infants are randomized to receive either 4 meq/kg/day supplemental sodium or an equal amount of sterile water on days of life 7-35 . Institutional data from 2008 revealed that a sample size of 56 infants completing the study will detect a 15 % difference in the primary outcome of weight gain with 80 % power and an alpha error of 0.05 .

"International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh",NCT01795131,Vitamin B12 Supplementation During Pregnancy,"International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh",2,1,Nutritional Anemia in Mothers.,Dietary Supplement,Vitamin B12,Health Services Research,Triple,"Nutritional anemia is a major public health problem among children and women in developing countries . Despite ongoing national program of supplementing pregnant women with iron-folate , prevalence of anemia is 39 % among pregnant women and 78 % among infants in Bangladesh . Vitamin B12 deficiency is a more prevalent cause of megaloblastic anemia than folate in many developing countries . This data raises the interest to address the role of vitamin B12 deficiency in nutritional anemia . Low dietary intake of animal products , a predominant source of vitamin B12 may cause anemia . Besides maintaining normal erythropoiesis , B12 is essential for immune function . However , no studies have evaluated the effect of maternal B12 supplementation on reduction of anemia and improving immunity of their infants . The investigators hypothesize that vitamin B12 supplementation plus iron-folate during pregnancy and 3-mo postpartum would : ( a ) Decrease anemia among mothers and infants ; ( b ) Improve vaccine specific cellular and humoral immune responses among mothers ; ( c ) Improve vaccine specific immunity in infants by passive transfer ; ( d ) Improve DNA methylation and one-carbon metabolism in mother-child pairs ; ( e ) Reduce antenatal/postnatal depression . Results from this study will guide and provide support to the policy makers to identify effective strategies to reduce nutritional anemia in population at risk . The investigators aim to conduct a double-masked placebo controlled trial to investigate the added effect of vitamin B12 on the iron-folate supplementation among pregnant women . Anemic ( Hb level < 11.0 g/dl ) mothers at 11-14 weeks of gestation will be randomized into two groups : supplement group will receive 250 ug vitamin B12 plus 400 ug folate and 60 mg iron ; placebo group will receive folate and iron only . This daily supplementation will continue up to 3-mo postpartum . At 26-28 wk of gestation mothers will be given inactivated influenza vaccine . Data on anthropometric indices of mothers and children , birth size , infant growth and morbidity ( mothers and children ) throughout the study period will be recorded . 24-h dietary recall data will be collected from the mothers bimonthly throughout the study . Biochemical indicators of anemia including Hb , vitamin B12 , ferritin , folate and α-glycoprotein ( AGP ) will be assessed in plasma of mothers ( pre- and post-supplementation ) and infants ( cord blood and 3-months ) . Additional measurements include serum transferrin receptor ( sTfR ) in plasma and methyl malonic acid ( MMA ) and total homocysteine ( tHcy ) in the urine of mothers . Plasma vaccine specific antibody responses will be measured in mothers ( pre- and post supplementation ) and in infants ( cord blood and 3-months ) . In breast milk , B12 , folate and s-IgA will be determined . Genetic polymorphism ( one-carbon metabolism ) and DNA methylation will be studied in mothers and in cord blood .","Study Area : A maternity clinic in Mirpur with substantial numbers of pregnant women enrolling each month ( about 300-400/month ) will be selected for recruitment of local pregnant women . The community in Mirpur has a low out-migration rate . Pregnant women attending the clinic at 11-14 weeks of gestation and planning to deliver at the clinic to ensure safe delivery will be selected . The structured service and standard antenatal care of the clinic for safe delivery and antenatal care will be provided to each study participant . Study Population : Pregnant women ( n=120 ) will be screened during 11-14 weeks of gestation . Infants ( n=120 ) at 3 months of age . Inclusion Criteria : Hb level in the range of 7.0-11 g/dL Age : 22-35 years Mothers at the beginning of second trimester ( i.e . at 11-14 weeks of gestation ) Willing to stay in Dhaka during pregnancy and willing to get admitted in the clinic for delivery Self-reported Last Menstrual Period ( LMP ) and urine pregnancy test will be used to determine the gestational age . Exclusion Criteria : Women with severe anemia ; hemoglobin concentration < 7.0 g/dL History or presence of systemic disease H/O of previous complicated pregnancies or of pre-term delivery , abortion Receipt of influenza vaccine Definition : According to WHO , anemia is defined as a hemoglobin concentration < 12 g/dL in adult women . Anemia is further categorized as mild ( 10-11.9 g/dL ) , moderate ( 7.0-9.9 g/dL ) and severe ( < 7.0 g/dL ) . Study design : A double-blind controlled trial ; After informed consent is obtained , pregnant women will be randomly assigned either to Placebo group ( N=60 ) that will receive 60 mg of Fe and 400µg of folate daily or Supplementation group ( N=60 ) that will receive 250 µg of vitamin B12 in addition to 60 mg of Fe and 400µg of folate . A third party ( GlaxoSmithKline , Bangladesh ) will prepare and supply vitamin B12 or placebo capsule in bottles . The two capsules will be similar in appearance and taste . They will label the bottles as A and B . The responsible personnel from the Company will keep it confidential until the end of study . The capsule either A or B to be received by the 1st participant will be determined by a lottery , and thereafter every alternate participant will receive that capsule . The IDs of the participants will be given sequentially . The daily supplementation of iron-folate as well as of B12 will continue up to 3-months postpartum . At 26-28 weeks of gestation , all mothers will receive a single inactivated , trivalent influenza virus vaccine intramuscularly ( IM ) . Standard inactivated trivalent influenza as recommended by WHO for the Northern Hemisphere will be obtained from commercial sources for this project ( GlaxoSmithKline ; Dresden , Germany ) . Field workers ( FW ) will deliver two weeks ' dose of either placebo or supplements to mothers in person and will check the compliance by card and left over pills . The pregnant women will be clearly instructed about the times for their subsequent follow-up visits , and when followed up in respective homes they will be reminded of the dates . Routine Service : The routine care provided by the clinic includes Hb measurement , physical examination ( weight , blood pressure , pulse rate , abdominal check-up , fetal heart rate , ultrasonographic examination as necessary ) , counseling on diet , descriptions of normal procedures during pregnancy , associated potential complications , how and when to go to the clinic during such events etc . This service is provided by the clinic physician with assistance from the nurses . Specimens : Fasting peripheral blood will be collected from mothers at 11 to 14 weeks of gestation , cord blood at delivery , colostrums within 24 hours and breast milk and peripheral blood from mothers after three months postpartum . Peripheral blood from infants will be collected at three months of age . Blood will be collected in anticoagulant ( EDTA ) coated tubes and layered on Ficoll-paque for density gradient centrifugation ; plasma will be separated from the top and stored at -70ºC for later analysis . Peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) will be separated for studying cellular immune responses . Urine will be collected from mothers at 11 - 14 weeks of gestation and at three months . For gene based studies , the DNA samples will be delinked and the identity will be made anonymous according to the standard procedures . Methods : Total hemoglobin ( Hb ) in whole blood will be measured by spectrophotometry using Drabakins Reagent ( Sigma Diagnostics ) . Standardized blood smear stain will be used for evaluating megaloblastic anemia ( presence of macroovalocytes and hypersegmented neutrophils ) . Ferritin , serum transferrin receptor ( sTfR ) and α-glycoprotein ( AGP ) will be measured in plasma by enzyme immune assays . Vitamin B12 and folate in plasma and vitamin B12 in breast milk will be assayed in Roche autoanalyzer Cobas e411 . Urinary methyl malonic acid ( MMA ) will be measured by fluorescence detector assisted HPLC method ( Sigma Diagnostics , St. Louis , MO . Briefly MMA will be extracted from urine sample with ethyl acetate . The extract is dried and derivatized with monodansylcadaverine and dicyclohexyl-carbodiimide prior to injection on the HPLC . Ethylmalonic acid will be used as an internal standard . Influenza vaccine-specific antibody responses ( IgA , IgG ) in plasma and colostrum/ breast milk [ secretory IgA ( s-IgA ) ] will be measured by ELISA . PBMC will be stimulated with Flu vaccine for blastogensis response . Genomic DNA methylation will be measured by the methyl acceptance assay based on the ability of isolated DNA to `` accept '' radiolabeled methyl groups from S- [ 3H-methyl ] adenosylmethionine , using the bacterial CpG methyltransferase SssI . Total homocysteine ( tHcy ) will be measured in urine samples by using HPLC with fluorimetric detection in which Thiols in the column effluent are detected by a single gold-mercury electrode . NaBH4 is used as a reductant , and no derivatization of sample is required . Mutations in the ALPL , MTHFR C677T and FUT2 genes will be determined by PCR- RFLP assay and DNA sequencing . All these assays will be performed in the Nutritional Biochemistry Lab which has the facilities to determine the biochemical markers of anemia , vaccine specific antibody responses , DNA methylation and polymorphism assays . Assessment of anthropometry and morbidity : Maternal anthropometrical measurements will be taken at the beginning of supplementation and monthly during the post supplementation period by trained FWs . Birth weight and recumbent length will be taken within 72 hours after birth and monthly measurements will be taken by FW up to 3 mo of age . At each visit ( fortnightly ) , Field Research Assistant ( FRA ) will collect data from mothers on morbidity of mothers and their infants ( e.g . diarrhoea , respiratory infections , skin diseases , assessment of severity of disease episodes ) of the previous 7 days using structured questionnaires . The FRAs will inform the women about the times of the first and subsequent follow-up visits , and ensure if they have understood clearly . In addition , study participants will be contacted over cell phones when available to remind them about the visit dates . When followed up in respective homes , they will be reminded of the next visit dates . Depression score : Participants will be interviewed on their mental status using the Centre for Epidemiological Studies-Depression ( CES-D ) questionnaire . The questionnaire contains 20 items comprising six major aspects of depression : depressed mood , hopelessness , worthlessness , fatigue , appetite and sleep disturbances . It was translated to Bengali and piloted in earlier studies and involves how the women felt during the preceding 7 days . It has been previously used in rural and urban Bangladeshi women ( Hamadani , unpublished data ) and found to correlate sensibly to children 's growth and development . The FRAs will be extensively trained to interview the women and inter-observer reliabilities will be obtained before and during the study . The interview will be conducted twice at the homes of the women during FRAs ' visits , first at baseline and at 3 mo postpartum . The data will be analyzed and interpreted by one of the co-investigators ( JDH ) who has knowledge and experience in dealing with this type of information . Food security and dietary diversity : The effect of food insecurity on food intake , health and nutritional status has been observed in many developing countries showing significantly lower total daily per capita food expenditures in food-insecure households than food-secure households . Food insecurity was associated with maternal anxiety and depression , which can have strong negative influence on infant care practices including breastfeeding duration as well as child nutritional status . About half of the Bangladeshi population is food-insecure . Hunger and childhood malnutrition in Bangladesh are among the highest in the world . About 31 % of the rural population in Bangladesh suffers from `` chronic poverty '' and about 19 % of rural households can not have `` full three meals '' a day . Thus , household food insecurity in relation to its enormous impact on health and nutritional status on human is a growing concern in Bangladesh . Household food security status and dietary diversity of the study participants ( including maternal dietary energy , protein , vitamin B-12 and folate intake ) will be assessed first , at the baseline when the pregnant women will be enrolled in the study and thereafter fortnightly throughout the study . USDA food composition database will be used for assessing vitamin B-12 intake . Any seasonal variation of the food security status will be assessed that might have significant impact on the outcome measures . Structured questionnaire on food security module will be used to measure household food security status . The FRAs will be trained to interview the women ; they will take interviews when they make visits during the antenatal and postnatal periods at the home . The data will be analyzed and interpreted by one of the co-investigators ( KKS ) who has knowledge and experience in dealing with this type of information .",2013-02-09,"April 2, 2014","Inclusion Criteria : Hb level in the range of 7.0-11 g/dL Age : 22-35 years Mothers at the beginning of second trimester ( i.e . at 11-14 weeks of gestation ) Willing to stay in Dhaka during pregnancy and willing to get admitted in the clinic for delivery Self-reported Last Menstrual Period ( LMP ) and urine pregnancy test will be used to determine the gestational age .

Diskapi Teaching and Research Hospital,NCT01869673,A Comparison of the Face Mask and Oral Mask Ventilation After Nasal Surgery,Diskapi Teaching and Research Hospital,4,1,Nasal Septum Deviation,Device,Face Mask,Treatment,Triple,"Difficult mask ventilation is usually studied in relation to airway management and difficult intubation and mostly during the induction period of anesthesia . According to the closed claim reports tracheal extubation and recovery of anesthesia is associated with brain damage or death . Difficult mask ventilation can also be a problem during the emergence phase of anesthesia after extubation . Especially after nasal surgery the use of nasal tampon and casts can resemble upper airway obstruction and facial deformity and cause difficult mask ventilation . The effectiveness of ventilation is affected by the design of the mask . Leaks may develop due to the inability to obtain a tight seal . The use of an oral mask for ventilation in patients with nasal tumors and after rhinoplasty for patients with a nasal cast has been reported . This suggests that oral mask ventilation , rather than face mask ventilation , should be considered after nasal surgery . The aim of this prospective randomized study is to compare the face mask and oral mask ventilation after nasal surgery in terms of the mask ventilation classification , airway pressure , minute ventilation and tidal volume . Our hypothesis is that ventilation with oral mask would provide better airway pressures , superior mask-ventilation classification and higher tidal volumes compared to face mask ventilation in patients with obstructed nasal pasage ( nasal packing and/or cast ) after nasal surgery ' .","American Society of Anesthesiologists ( ASA ) physical class I or II , adult patients aging 19-45 yr , scheduled for nasal surgery will be recruited . Patient characteristics will be recorded ; age , gender ASA physical status , height , weight . Simple randomization will be accomplished with a computer-generated sequence of numbers and sealed envelopes will be used to allocate patients into 2 treatment sequences , Sequence O : oral mask ventilation followed by face mask ventilation and Sequence FM : face mask ventilation followed by oral mask ventilation . Patients will be premedicated with midazolam . Ringer 's lactate infusion at 15 mL•kg-1•h-1 will be initiated . Standard monitors will be established including neuromuscular monitorization and the Bispectral index monitor ( BIS ) . The patients head will be placed in the neutral position on a positioning pad Anesthesia will be induced with propofol 2 ml kg and fentanyl 50 mcg . Anesthesia will be maintained with oxygen in nitrous oxide and sevoflurane . The patient was ventilated trough an face mask . The appropriate size mask with the best fit will be selected and the mask size will be noted . Gas flow will be 4 L min . During the induction period the mask ventilation grade of the patients will be determined ( Grade 0 : ventilation by mask not attempted , Grade 1 : ventilated by mask , Grade 2 : ventilated by mask with oral airway or other adjuvant , Grade 3 : difficult mask ventilation ( inadequate , unstable , or requiring two practitioners ) , Grade 4 : unable to mask ventilate ( Han 's grading scale ) ) and patients with Grade ≥ 2 will be excluded from the study . Muscle relaxation and intubation will be facilitated with rocuronium 0.6 mg kg-1 . At the end of surgery trachea will be extubated when TOF 0.9 is obtained and the patient is spontaneous breathing , meanwhile inhalation anesthesia will be continued ( BIS 50-70 ) . After extubation , spontaneous ventilation will be assisted with mask ventilation . Mask ventilation will be applied according to sequence allocation and the mask ventilation grades with each mask technique will be determined with the same grading system . Spontaneous ventilation will be assisted with mask ventilation . The face mask will be applied with the one handed EC-clamp technique . The mask will be placed over the bridge of the nose and mouth and a chin-lift , head tilt maneuver will be used . The oral mask ; size 1 or 2 child 's mask will be placed only over the mouth and the one handed EC-clamp technique with the chin-lift , head tilt maneuver will be used again . The masks will be changed after three consecutive measurements for each mask technique and the crossover time will be short . The respiratory parameters will be measured with the monitor contained in the Drager Primus anesthesia machine . The observer providing mask ventilation is experienced in mask ventilation and will be blinded to the monitor display . All patients will be ventilated by the same observer . Data will be recorded by independent residents . The mask ventilation classification will be recorded . mean airway pressure ( Pmean ) , maximum airway pressure ( Ppeak ) , tidal volume ( TV ) , expired tidal volume ( TVe ) minute volume leak ( MVleak ) and minute volume ( MV ) will be recorded during spontaneous ventilation . Volatile anesthesia will be ceased after observing that the patients are calm and not coughing and the respiratory measures will be evaluated thereafter . The APL ( airway pressure release ) valve will be closed during the evaluation of mask ventilation . Sufficient chest movement , mask leak , gastric insufflations will be assessed . Indicators for difficult mask ventilation are defined as ; TV < 4 ml kg , inadequate chest movements , the need for an oropharyngeal airway , two handed mask ventilation , need to increase the gas flow , gastric insufflations , need to ventilate with two operators . It was planned to enroll 30 patients in this study . After performing a pilot study we calculated that 10 patients in each group was sufficient to detect a difference between groups concerning tidal volume with 0.95 power and 0.05 alfa error .

In the case of pneumonia , aerosolized route of administration is favorable as it presumably delivers a high concentration of drug directly to the infection site . Colistimethate sodium is an FDA approved drug , however , its aerosolized use represents a new method of administration not currently FDA-approved in the United States . In this proposal , the inactive prodrug colistimethate sodium has been selected to use for aerosolization as it is better tolerated than colistin sulphate . It is a randomized , open-labeled Phase 1 trial of aerosolized and/or IV formulations of colistin as multiple doses over seven days . The primary objective of this trial is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple doses of aerosolized and intravenous colistimethate sodium separately or in combination in healthy adult subjects .","`` Colistin '' ( the first breakdown product colistimethate sodium , also known as polymyxin E ) is comprised of approximately 30 different polymyxins , with colistin A ( polymyxin E1 ) and colistin B ( polymyxin B ) accounting for upwards of 85 % of the mass . It is amphipathic , can not be absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and is administered intramuscularly , intravenously ( IV ) or via inhalation . While approved for aerosolized use in the United Kingdom , and used in Europe for decades as such , aerosolized colistin is not FDA-approved in the United States . The intravenous formulation is approved for use in the U.S. , but due to the age of the drug , it did not undergo rigorous studies of safety prior to FDA-approval . Thus , detailed pharmacokinetic data are limited and dosing is not standardized , although the maximum IV dose should not exceed 5mg/kg/day , divided into two to four equal doses . In the United Kingdom , the recommended dosing of nebulized colistin for adults is one million units ( 1MIU ) twice daily . Despite the paucity of dosing and safety guidelines , aerosolized colistin is being prescribed regularly out of necessity given the emergence of multi-drug resistant organisms ( MDROs ) . MDROs are strongly associated with nosocomial pneumonia and several strains are only susceptible to this older drug , thus there is an urgent need for clarification on the safe use of colistin , including in aerosolized form as this delivers a high concentration of drug directly to the infection site .

National Institutes of Health Clinical Center (CC),NCT01867424,Gadoxetate Enhanced Imaging Study to Detect Prostate Cancer,National Cancer Institute (NCI),2,1,Prostate Cancer,Drug,Eovist,Diagnostic,,"Background : - Prostate cancer is the most common cancer type among men . Some prostate cancers respond to hormonal therapy . However , some cell characteristics of other prostate cancers cause it not to respond as well to these therapies . Researchers want to see if gadoxetate , a contrast agent used to help identify damaged liver tissue , can help tell these types of prostate cancer apart . It may be able to identify if a man has a type of prostate cancer for which hormone therapy may not work as well . Objectives : - To see if gadoxetate can help identify different types of prostate cancers during imaging studies . Eligibility : - Men at least 18 years of age who have prostate cancer . Participants will be having surgery to either remove the prostate or take tumor tissue samples . Design : Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history . Blood samples will be collected . Participants will have a magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan of the lower torso . They will receive gadoxetate during the MRI scan . Participants who have surgery will have a sample of their tumor cells collected . Those who have a biopsy will provide cells from this biopsy for study . Treatment will not be provided as part of this study .","BACKGROUND : Prostate cancer is the most common non-cutaneous malignancy among men in the western world . Prognostic biomarkers would be useful in stratifying patients to different treatments . The expression of a testosterone membrane transporter , organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1B3 ( OATP1B3 ) , is associated with shorter time to progression after hormonal ablation therapy and shorter overall survival in prostate cancer patients . 52 % of localized prostate cancer lesions express OATP1B3 , while 92 % of prostate cancer metastases requiring hormonal ablation treatment , express OATP1B3 in soft tissue lesions . Expression of OATP1B3 also correlates with Gleason grade . Current imaging methods can not predict treatment failure or resistance . Gadoxetate disodium ( Gd-EOB-DTPA ) ( Eovist , Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals Inc. Pittsburgh , PA ) is an MR imaging agent which is FDA-approved gadolinium chelate for detecting hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) , as normal hepatocytes express OATP1B3 while most hepatocellular carcinomas ( HCC ) do not . However , those HCCs that do take up Eovist have been shown to express OATP1B3 . Eovist may be useful to evaluate OATP1B3 status in patients with prostate cancer and may therefore serve as a prognostic and treatment biomarker . PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : -Evaluate the uptake and retention of Eovist in prostate cancers . ELIGIBILTY : Male subjects greater than or equal to 18 years old Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Performance score of 0 to 2 Subjects with clinically localized prostate cancer must have image guided biopsy confirmed prostate cancer and sufficient tissue available for OATP1B3 immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) .

DESIGN : This pilot study will accrue 25 subjects divided into two arms : 10 evaluable subjects with localized prostate cancer and 15 evaluable subjects with advanced disease Each subject will receive a single intravenous ( IV ) dose of Eovist by bolus injection All subjects will undergo magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) prior to and immediately after , 10 , 20 and 60 minutes post-Eovist injection",2013-05-31,"July 1, 2020","INCLUSION CRITERIA : 2.1.1.1 Subject is greater than or equal to 18 years old . 2.1.1.2 Subjects with clinically localized prostate cancer ( outside pathology is acceptable ) must have image guided biopsy confirmed prostate cancer and sufficient tissue available ( obtained before or after 20 weeks of Eovist injection ) for organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1B3 ( OATP1B3 ) expression . 2.1.1.3 Subjects with advanced disease who have failed hormone therapy and who have sufficient tissue ( obtained before or after 20 weeks of Eovist injection ) from a soft tissue lesion ( measuring greater than or equal to 1.5cm in diameter at computed tomography ( CT ) or magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan ) available for OATP1B3 expression . or 2.1.1.4 Subjects , for whom tissue is not available , must have a soft tissue or metastatic bone lesion that can be biopsied and be willing to undergo percutaneous biopsy to obtain tissue for OATP1B3 expression . 2.1.1.5 Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status less than or equal to 2 2.1.1.6 Serum creatinine within 3 weeks prior to Eovist MRI less than or equal to 1.8mg/dl and estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) must be greater than 30 ml/min/1.73m ( 2 ) . 2.1.1.7 Patients must have normal liver function as defined below : total bilirubin less than 2 times normal institutional limits or greater than 3.0 mg/dl in patients with Gilberts syndrome Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase ( SGOT ) and alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase ( SGPT ) less than or equal to 3 times institutional upper limit of normal 2.1.1.8 Ability of subject to sign a written informed consent document EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 2.1.2.1 Subjects with known hypersensitivity and allergy to gadolinium contrast agents 2.1.2.2 Subjects with any coexisting medical or psychiatric condition that is likely to interfere with study procedures and/or results 2.1.2.3 Subjects with severe claustrophobia unresponsive to oral anxiolytics 2.1.2.4 Subjects with contraindications to magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) 2.1.2.5 Subjects weighing greater than 136 kg ( weight limit for scanner table ) 2.1.2.6 Subjects with pacemakers , cerebral aneurysm clips , shrapnel injury , or other implanted electronic devices or metal not compatible with MRI 2.1.2.7 Subjects with other medical conditions deemed by the principle investigator ( or associates ) to make the subject ineligible for protocol procedures 2.1.2.8 Subjects who will have a delay in clinically indicated radiation therapy due to the interval between Eovist MRI imaging and biopsy",24,1,18 Years,99 Years
Karolinska Institutet,NCT01865136,Post-abortion Care and Contraceptive Counselling by Midwives or Physicians,Karolinska Institutet,4,1,Pregnancy,Other,Medical Post Abortion Care,Health Services Research,,"The aim of this project is to study the safety , efficacy and effectiveness of medical treatment of incomplete abortion provided to women by physicians or midwives in Kisumu , Kenya . In Kenya , Post Abortion Care ( PAC ) , provided by physicians , nurse-midwives and clinical officers , has been integrated at private reproductive health facilities since 1998 . Misoprostol as treatment of incomplete abortion was launched I Nyanza Province in April , 2012 . The involvement of midwives in medical ( Misoprostol ) treatment of incomplete abortion has , however , not been systematically evaluated . There is a need to determine whether midwives and physician can perform medical treatment of incomplete abortion equally safe and effective in Kenya . The results will thus provide evidence-based information that can contribute to the development of strategies to increase women 's access to Post Abortion Care in Kenya as well as in other low-income contexts .","The project will take place at Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital ( JOOTRH ) and Kisumu East District Hospital ( KEDH ) , in Kisumu County of Nyanza Province in Western Kenya . The project will be implemented within the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at the two facilities . Altogether the two facilities admit around 60 women per month with incomplete abortion . Midwives and physicians included in the project will undergo a standardized training prior to the study . This will include basic knowledge on treatment of incomplete abortion and post abortion contraceptive counselling as well as interview technique . The training will be both theoretical and practical and on-going during the project in order to cover all / new staff . The sample size has been calculated with the objective of showing two-sided equivalence , assuming that the overall complication rate could be as high as 4-5 percent and would apply to both types of providers . To demonstrate two-sided equivalence within a margin of 4-5 percent with 80 % power and using a 95 % CI ( α=0.05 ) , about 816 women would need to be recruited . In addition , about 10 percent could be expected lost to follow up and will be adjusted for . Thus , a total of 880 women will be recruited . The randomization will be conducted in blocks of 8 and will vary randomly . A computer random number generator will be used to generate a list of codes from 1 to 880 and each code is linked to one of the two groups - A= PAC care and misoprostol by midwife and B= PAC care and misoprostol by physician . The list will be used while sequentially numbered , opaque , sealed envelopes will be prepared by the research team . Each envelope contains a study protocol for the individual woman . At the time of allocation , the research assistant at the clinic will pick the envelope with the lowest number , write the participant 's name and personal registration number on it , and then open it . Process evaluation will be conducted by intermittent check-ups in order to assure that the intervention procedures are performed correctly and that they follow the protocol . The check-ups will be made by a researcher and include both a review of the completed protocols and repetition and education of the physicians and midwives involved in the study . All eligible women who consent to participation will undergo a clinical assessment by the provider they have been randomized to . The clinical assessment includes ( i ) medical history taking , Last Menstrual Period ( LMP ) , Obstetric and Gynaecological history , contraceptive history , symptoms ) ( ii ) General physical examination ( pulse , blood pressure and temperature ) ; ( iii ) Pelvic examination that include examination of size of the uterus ( External genitalia , speculum examination , Bimanual examination ) .

Social cognition ( the ability to understand your feelings and the feelings of others ) is closely related to functional outcomes , including communication , empathy , and emotional recognition .","Schizophrenia is a disabling disease that affects about 1 % of the population and is one of the leading causes of psychiatric disability . Striking early in life , schizophrenia interferes with work , relationships , and independence . Despite the billions of dollars spent annually in the direct and indirect costs of this disease , there are few treatment options that restore functionality . Lately , cognition has emerged as a target for interventions , since a patient 's cognitive status is one of the most reliable predictors of functional outcome , and yet treatments for improving cognition have delivered only modest results . This study will attempt to evaluate the efficacy of Fanapt® ( iloperidone ) on social cognition , which consists of factors such as empathy , social perception , and emotional recognition , and may be more meaningfully tied to functional outcome than cognition in general .

University of Pittsburgh,NCT01925482,"Trans-Middle-Ear Mucosal Gas Exchange Project 1, Specific Aim 1",Cuneyt M. Alper,1,1,Middle Ear Gas Exchange,Drug,"6%CO2, 25%O2, balance N2",Basic Science,,"This study will measure the speed at which gases move between the middle-ear air-space and the blood flowing through the middle-ear lining . The middle ear is a rigid biological gas pocket located behind the eardrum and is filled with the same gases as in air , primarily oxygen ( O ) , nitrogen ( N ) and carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) , but in different proportions . The middle ear is lined by a thin layer of cells overlying tissues that surround blood vessels . The blood that flows through the middle-ear lining also contains these same gases but at different proportions from both the atmosphere ( room air ) and middle ear . Because of the differences in the proportions of these gases , each gas tends to flow between the middle ear and blood trying to make the proportions of gases in those compartments the same . This flow of gases to and from the middle ear changes the middle-ear pressure . If the middle-ear pressure decreases much below the air pressure of the atmosphere , the ability to hear sounds is impaired and fluid can build up in the middle ear . It is expected that each different gas will move between the middle ear and blood at a different speed , but it is not known what those speeds are for any of the gases . It is also expected that those speeds will be different for ears that have had middle-ear disease and those that have not . In this study , we will measure the speed of nitrogen , oxygen and carbon dioxide exchanges in both directions between the middle ear and blood . To do this , the gas mixture in the middle ear will be changed so that there is movement of only one gas for each experiment and then measure the change in the amount of the gas in the middle ear . This can be done using a special instrument called a mass spectrometer if there is an open , working tympanostomy ( ventilation ) tube , a small plastic tube , in the eardrum . For all participants in this study , we will conduct 6 experiments lasting about 2 hours each to measure the speed of nitrogen , oxygen and carbon dioxide flow . Subjects with and without tympanostomy tubes will be recruited . Those without a tube will have a tube inserted in one ear for study purposes and it will be removed at the end of the study ; these subjects will be followed weekly until the hole in the eardrum ( where the tube was ) is closed .","Adequate middle ear ( ME ) pressure-regulation , defined as the maintenance of a total ME pressure at approximately ambient levels , is required for normal hearing and to preserve ME health . The mechanism of ME pressure-regulation consists of two distinct components that affect total ME gas pressure : the bolus , total gradient driven exchange of gases between the ME and nasopharynx during active , transient Eustachian tube ( ET ) openings and the passive , partial-pressure gradient driven diffusive exchange of gases between the ME cavity and adjacent compartments including the local blood via the ME mucosa ( MEM ) and environment via the tympanic membrane . The basic physiology of gas transfers through the ET is well established and a slow to negligible gas exchange across the normal and inflamed tympanic membrane has been measured for chinchillas , cats and monkeys , and confirmed by us for humans . In contrast , the characteristics of transMEM gas exchange is controversial . Mathematical modeling shows that transMEM gas exchange controls the ME pressure trajectory between ET openings and the relative rates of exchange for the different physiologic gases defines the demand placed on the ET for ME gas resupply . Here , we empirically measure the transMEM ME-to-blood and the blood-to-ME exchange constants for the physiologic gases in humans with normal and inflamed MEMs . For that purpose , a total of 20 otherwise healthy adult subjects , 10 with no significant history of ME ear disease ( Group-1 ) and 10 with at least 1 functional ventilation tube ( VT ) inserted for extant ME disease ( Group-2 ) . Group-1 subjects will have VT insertion under local anesthetic in the research clinic and , for all subjects , a custom-made acrylic ear-plug will be fabricated and fitted with a sensor for measuring pressure , a syringe for adjusting system pressure and micro-tubing to allow for periodic gas sampling with composition analysis by an online mass-spectrometer . All subjects will undergo a series of six transMEM gas exchange experiments , with each experiment designed to establish a ME-to-blood or a blood-to-ME partial-pressure gradient for one of the 3 physiologic gases , N2 , O2 or CO2 . During each experiment , the ear-plug will be inserted into and sealed within the ear canal . The ear-plug will be attached by valves to a line leading to the mass-spectrometer and to a known composition gas source , and the system ( ear-plug + ME ) washed with a test gas specific to the experiment . Then , the ear-plug will be closed to the gas source , and for the 60 to 90 minute duration of the experiment , system pressure will be recorded continuously and ME gas samples will be taken at 10 minute intervals for composition analysis . The data will be transformed to estimate the transMEM conductance ( exchange constant ) for the test gas . On the last day of the experimental series , the Group-2 subjects will be dismissed ; Group-1 subjects will have their VT removed and then be followed weekly until the tympanic membrane perforation has healed . At that time , audiometry which was performed before VT insertion will be repeated . The results will be used to complete our mathematical models of ME pressure-regulation as the ME transitions from health to disease . These empirical data will also be used to evaluate certain hypotheses related to the limitations placed on the exchange of each gas species and regarding the directional symmetry of the exchange processes .",2013-08-08,"February 16, 2019","Inclusion Criteria : Otherwise healthy adults aged 18 to 50 years No history of significant ME disease ; intact tympanic membrane ( Group 1 only ) Functional tympanostomy tube or chronic perforation after tube extruded ; tube placed for middle-ear effusion/Eustachian tube dysfunction ( Group 2 ) No history of past ME surgeries other than ventilation tubes ( Group 2 ) , Able to comprehend study risks and provide written Informed Consent Exclusion Criteria : Have any chronic health problem Have ME fluid or otitis media ( OM ) at the time of presentation for ventilation tube insertion ( Group 1 only ) Have drainage through the ventilation tube at the time of testing Have a cold or allergic rhinitis at the time of testing Taking any prescription drug with the exception of those for birth control Have a known or suspected allergy/adverse reaction to any of the study drugs use to prepare the tympanic membrane for ventilation tube insertion ( Group 1 only ) Have a hearing threshold > 15 dB or a > 10 dB air-bone gap at any of the speech frequencies ( Group 1 only )",16,0,18 Years,50 Years

University of Pittsburgh,NCT01925495,"Gas Supply, Demand and Middle Ear Gas Balance: Specific Aim 3",Cuneyt M. Alper,0,0,Middle-ear Function,Other,varied middle-ear pressure,Basic Science,,"This is a study to determine if there are reflexes that detect changes in eardrum position or in the pressure of middle-ear gases and respond with changes in the ease by which the Eustachian tube is opened . The Eustachian tube is the normal tube that connects the middle ear to the nose . It is usually closed , but can be opened by contraction of 2 small muscles that surround the tube . If the Eustachian tube does not open frequently enough , the pressure in the middle ear will decrease , the eardrum will be pulled in toward the middle ear causing a hearing loss , and fluid will accumulate in the middle ear to try and stabilize its pressure . There is some evidence that the changes in eardrum position and middle-ear pressure when the Eustachian tube does not open frequently enough can be detected by the brain that , in turn , sends signals to the Eustachian tube and its muscles to make Eustachian tube opening easier . In this study , we will test this possibility . Specifically , in 3 experiments done on 5 different days , we will move the eardrum in and out , apply different pressures to the middle ear , or change the composition of the gases in the middle ear while we measure how difficult it is to open the Eustachian tube by increasing middle-ear pressure or by measuring the `` readiness '' of the Eustachian tube muscles to contract and open the tube .","Adequate middle ear ( ME ) pressure-regulation , defined as the maintenance of a total ME pressure at approximately ambient levels , is required for normal hearing and to preserve ME health . The mechanism of ME pressure-regulation consists of two distinct components that affect total ME gas pressure : the bolus , total gradient driven exchange of gases between the ME and nasopharynx during active , transient Eustachian tube ( ET ) openings and the passive , partial-pressure gradient driven diffusive exchange of gases between the ME cavity and adjacent compartments . A large number of past studies have described the basic physiology of gas transfers through the ET in humans , but few have explored the possibility that physiological feedback mechanisms could modulate ET functional efficiency . However , there is an anatomic foundation to support feedback modulation of ET function and the results for some experiments in animals lend credibility to that possibility . Theoretically , the sensory components of possible feedback pathways could consist of stretch sensors in the tympanic membrane ( TM ; detecting position ) and tensor tympani muscle ( detecting tension ) and/or chemo- ( detecting gas pressures ) / baro- ( detecting total pressure ) receptors in the ME mucosa and effector components consisting of resting Tensor Veli Palatini muscle ( mTVP ) tonus and/or the extant ET periluminal pressure . In this study , we explore 3 hypothesized stimulus-effector pairings in 10 otherwise healthy adult subjects with no history of significant ME disease and normal audiologic testing . Custom ear plugs will be made for use in Visits 2-6 . The protocol includes 1 screening visit and 3 experiments requiring 5 experimental sessions of approximately 3-5 hours duration each done at a minimum interval of 2 days . Briefly , in Experiment 1 ( Visit 2 ) , ear canal pressure will be varied to change the position of the TM while simultaneously monitoring mTVP tonus by electromyography ( EMG ) . Then , a unilateral ventilation tube ( VT ) inserted into the TM to allow access to the ME cavity . For Experiment 2 , ( Visits 3-5 ) , the ME will be washed with physiologic , hypercarbic , and hyperoxic gas compositions ( reference ME normal ) while monitoring the ET periluminal tissue pressures measured as the ET resistance to gas flow . For Experiment 3 ( Visit 6 ) , total ME pressure will be varied while monitoring mTVP tonus by EMG . At the completion of Experiment 3 , the VT will be removed and , then , the subjects will be followed weekly ( Visits 7+ ) until documented healing of the TM at which time a standard audiologic assessment will be done . If the hypotheses are supported , selected activation of the feedback mechanisms would improve ET function and could be exploited as one component of a treatment protocol to improve ME pressure-regulation .",2013-08-13,"May 15, 2019","Inclusion Criteria : Otherwise healthy adults aged 18 to 50 years , inclusive No history of significant ME disease No history of past ME surgeries Able to comprehend study risks and provide written Informed Consent Exclusion Criteria : Have any chronic health problem Have ME fluid or otitis media ( OM ) at the time of presentation Have drainage through the tympanostomy tube at the time of testing Taking any prescription drug with the exception of those for birth control that would interfere with study per study MD Have a known or suspected allergy/adverse reaction to any of the study drugs use to prepare the tympanic membrane for ventilation tube insertion or the nasopharynx for EMG needle insertion Have a hearing threshold > 15 dB or a > 10 dB air-bone gap at any of the speech frequencies Pregnant or nursing Temporary exclusion : expected need for seasonal allergy med during study",32,0,18 Years,50 Years

Diagnosis is based on intraocular pressure ( IOP ) and assessment of the optic nerve , cornea and other structures . Accurate intraocular pressure measurements in young children is often impossible to obtain in an office setting . Children need sedation or general anesthesia to determine IOP . All volatile general anesthetics affect the IOP . Nitrous Oxide , a weak volatile anesthetic , does not affect IOP in healthy adults . Since Nitrous Oxide has shown to be safe and effective in a variety of practice environments , we want to evaluate the use of nitrous oxide in oxygen to obtain IOP measurements in children .","The investigator 's intention is to measure the IOP under nitrous oxide in Oxygen followed by measurements under Sevoflurane in a population of children without glaucoma who are already scheduled to undergo general anesthesia for an elective eye surgery . Normally , induction and maintenance of general anesthesia in children includes the addition of volatile anesthetics such as Sevoflurane . The investigators hypothesize that in children , Nitrous oxide will affect IOP from pre-anesthetic baseline minimally . Hence , when sequential IOP measurements are taken in short intervals ( every 30 seconds times 3 ) , there will be minimal changes during the initial nitrous oxide phase of the induction when compared to the subsequent addition of Sevoflurane . Subject 's parents will be consented and if the subject is old enough to understand the procedure , we will have them also sign an assent to the participation of this study.The child will be randomized to either the nitrous oxide in oxygen and Sevoflurane group or the Nitrous oxide in oxygen alone group or Sevoflurane in oxygen group without Nitrous oxide in the inhalational anesthetic mix .

The aim is to evaluate whether metformin can increase the pCR rate combination with TEC regimen in neoadjuvant setting .","Neoadjuvant therapy is the standard treatment for locally advanced breast cancer and has adopted in early breast cancer treatment . A meta-analysis showed no difference between neoadjuvant therapy and adjuvant therapy in terms of survival and overall disease progression . Therefore , neoadjuvant treatment can be offered as a standard treatment and as an alternative to adjuvant treatment to all patients who are expected to be candidates for adjuvant systemic chemotherapy . Patients achieved pCR after treatment have superior outcome . The taxanes were introduced into clinical practice in the early 1990s , and recent meta-analysis showed that compared with anthracycline-containing chemotherapy , taxanes-containing regimens significantly reduced the annual breast cancer recurrences and deaths . Right now , TAC regimen has widely accepted as adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens in breast cancer treatment . Metformin , an inexpensive oral agent commonly used to treat type 2 diabetes , has been garnering increasing attention as a potential anti-cancer agent . In neoadjuvant treatment of breast cancer , a retrospective clinical study from MDACC reported a significantly increased pCR rates to standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy in diabetic breast cancer patients who were receiving metformin ( 24 % pCR ) compared to diabetics not receiving metformin ( 8 % pCR ) , with intermediate rates in non-diabetics who did not receive metformin ( 16 % pCR ) , indicating metformin may increase pCR rate with neoadjuvant chemotherapy . Base on these data , we initiate a prospective study to evaluate docetaxel , epirubicin and cyclophosphomide ( TEC ) with TEC plus metformin in neoadjuvant treatment of breast cancer patients .

Atopic dermatitis has special features such as increase of acidophil , high expression ratio of IgE in the blood . Recently , Atopic dermatitis is estimated to developing for 10 to 20 percent of the population in the world . However , there is no distinguished treatment to completely recover . Especially , most of diagnosis are made when the patients are younger than 5 years old . Moreover , 50 percent of them get diagnose Atopic dermatitis between 6 month and 24 month . According to the National epidemiological investigation conducted by the Korean Academy of Pediatric Allergy and Respiratory Disease , Outbreak ratio of Atopic dermatitis continually increase for the past decade . Accordingly , it has become a major social concern . It is really important for the patients to care and diagnose as soon as they find out symptoms of Atopic dermatitis . The reason is that 50 to 75 percent of the Atopic dermatitis patients are suffering from Allergies which cause asthma and rhinitis . Recently , It has been reported that Mesenchymal stem cells have special abilities to restrict the growth of lymphocyte non-specific and to restrict the activation of lymphocyte by the stimulus of mitogen or antigen . It is also reported that the restrict of lymphocyte by Mesenchymal stem cells does not need HLA-matching unlike the case of T-cell . It has been found that Mesenchymal stem cells ' ability of autoimmune induction is weak because of low expression of antigen like HLA-DR . It is also discovered that Mesenchymal stem cells do not cause autoimmune side-effect even though we inject them in the body . When the body get infected by the pathogens , innate immune response operate as the primary defence mechanism . at this time , there are some receptors reacting first such as TLR ( toll-like receptor ) and NLR ( nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain ) which is located in the cytoplasm of a cell . It is reported that the activities of TLR which is expressed by Mesenchymal stem cells play an important roles about immunomodulatory ability of Mesenchymal stem cells . Furthermore , human Umbilical Cord Blood derived-Universal Stem Cells ( hUCB-USCs ) manifest TLR and NLR of Mesenchymal Stem cells at the same time . when those receptors become activation , it maximize ability of immunomodulatory . Therefore , hUCB-USCs can be utilized to cure intractable autoimmune disease like Atopic dermatitis . Further , It has huge possibility as cell therapy products for autoimmune disease .",2013-08-20,"October 5, 2016","Inclusion Criteria : Of either gender , aged ≥20 and ≤60 years Atopic Dermatitis subjects who are coincident with Hanifin and Rajka diagnosis criteria subacute and chronic Atopic subjects who have Atopic Dermatitis symptoms continually at least 6 months Subjects with over moderate atopic dermatitis ( SCORAD score > 20 ) Subjects who understand and voluntarily sign an informed consent form Exclusion Criteria : Subjects who have systemic infection at the baseline visit Subjects who have asthma at the baseline visit Treatment with oral corticosteroids , oral antibiotics , whole body photochemotherapy , immunosuppressive drug within 4 weeks before the baseline visit Treatment with topical steroids , antibiotics within 2 weeks before the baseline visit Subjects who already took or need to take the medicine which is prohibited to take during the clinical study .

University of Utah,NCT01968590,Vitamin D Supplementation for Adults With Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1),University of Utah,2,0,Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1),Drug,Cholecalciferol,Prevention,Double,"This clinical trial is conducted by one of 4 locations ; University of British Columbia ( Vancouver , CA ) , University of Utah ( Salt Lake City , UT , USA ) , University of Cincinnati ( Cincinnati , OH , USA ) , and University of Hamburg ( Hamburg , Germany ) . Adults with NF1 have a higher risk of osteopenia and osteoporosis , a condition of low bone density that can lead to fragile bones and bone breakage . People with NF1 also have lower vitamin D levels than unaffected individuals . Vitamin D is important for normal bone health , but studies to improve bone health by vitamin D supplementation in people with NF1 have not been tried . The purpose of this study is to treat adults with NF1 who have insufficient serum vitamin D levels with 2 different doses of vitamin D supplementation to determine if vitamin D supplementation ameliorates the usual loss of bone mineral density over 2 years .","Individuals with NF1 and vitamin D insufficiency will be supplemented with 2 different doses of cholecalciferol ( vitamin D ) to see if their loss of bone mineral density is lessened over time . It is important to study vitamins as carefully as one would study medications , even though vitamins are generally safer than medications . For this reason , a carefully controlled trial of two doses of vitamin D will be performed over a 2-year period . It will include controlled doses and safety checks for participants ' health to be sure that the vitamin D supplementation is safe for people with NF1 . Two different doses of cholecalciferol , either 600 IU or 4,000 IU ( IU means `` International Units '' a standard measure of the strength of the dose ) , will be used for supplementation . The trial is `` double blind '' . This means that neither participant nor investigator team know which dose an individual participant might be randomized to receive until after the trial ends . In an emergency , however , the investigator can find out . Participants will be randomized to one or the other dose , and each participant will be provided a bottle of liquid called `` D-drops '' with a dropper that automatically drops out a measured amount when the bottle is turned upside down . Both doses of vitamin D , 600 IU and 4,000 IU , have been approved in the general population ; however , it is possible that the bodies of people with NF1 handle vitamin D differently . Therefore , safety measures are assessed during this trial . Any new medical issues or concerns throughout the 2-year period will need to be recorded and assessed with the study team . The primary measure of this study is bone mineral density obtained by bone densitometry ( DXA ) using low-dose xrays . Bone mineral density will be tested at the beginning and the end of the trial focusing on density of bones in the hip and spine . Secondary measures of this trial include questionnaires that measure quality of life and history of bone fractures . When someone is insufficient in serum vitamin D and supplementation is recommended , it is also supplemented with calcium . Therefore , participants will be given a calcium supplement of 400 mg elemental calcium per day . A diary to keep daily track of vitamin D and calcium supplementation and documentation of fractures , should they occur , is provided .",2013-10-07,"May 17, 2022","Inclusion Criteria : All individuals with NF1 ( neurofibromatosis type 1 ) , based on NIH diagnostic criteria , who are between the ages of 25 and 40 years , may participate in this study .

A total of 120 persons will be randomized to the study , with the goal of completing 100 evaluable subjects . At the screening assessment , participants will complete the informed consent ; questionnaires on basic demographic information including personal medical history and allergies to drug compounds ; a mental ability test called the Mini-Mental Status Examination ( MMSE ) ; the SF-12 Health survey ; the Centers for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale ( CES-D ) and distribute instructions and forms for diet survey and gastrointestinal questionnaires . At the baseline/randomization assessment , study staff will ( a ) Confirm eligibility based on screening tests ; ( b ) collect completed diet and gastrointestinal questionnaire survey forms ; ( c ) collect blood for CBC/CMP and antioxidant biomarkers ; ( d ) battery of cognitive tests including Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test , Educational Testing Service - Identical Pictures Test , Educational Testing Service - Number Comparison Test , Educational Testing Service - Vocabulary Test , Trailmaking A & B , Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale - Digit Symbol Test , Wechsler Intelligence Scale - Digit Span , Letter Fluency , Category Fluency . Subjects will be equally randomized ( n=60 per arm ) to blinded treatment with either NT-020 ( Natura Therapeutics Nutrastem ) or matching placebo , and an initial supply of study drug will be dispensed . Participants will be supplied with one-month supply of blinded treatment ( n=60/arm ) and be given the study agent intake and symptom log form . The planned intervention period is 2 months . At specified intervals ( weeks 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 ) , participants will be contacted to inquire about the correct administration of the supplement or placebo as well as to assess for any adverse events . At one month ( midpoint ) , participants will return to campus to ( a ) collect blood for CBC/CMP and antioxidant biomarkers , ( b ) collect unused nutritional supplement or placebo and completed study agent intake and symptom log form ; ( c ) collect completed diet survey ; ( d ) supply participant with new one-month supply of nutritional supplement or placebo and new study agent intake and symptom log form .

Other endpoints include : assessing the safety of NT-020 under the proposed dosing regimen ; investigating the effect of NT-020 on additional measures of cognitive performance . An additional exploratory endpoints is to examine results from serum and urine diagnostic markers ( C-reactive protein , IL-1B , TNFa ) after 2 months of intervention with nutritional supplement vs. placebo . STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS Study Design/Endpoints The central hypothesis for this Phase II clinical trial is that adults who receive NT-020 will exhibited faster acquisition of the delay eyeblink conditioning , as compared to adults on the placebo . Sample Size/Accrual Rate We anticipate screening 120 persons , randomizing 100 , and having 88 persons complete the two-month study period . We powered the analysis for the repeated measures ANOVA for the eyeblink conditioning paradigm . Power was estimated to be .80 ( α = .05 ) , assuming six blocks of trials during the acquisition of the CR , an effect size of f = .16 for the group X trials interaction , and a sample size of 44 per group , assuming an attrition rate of 12 % over the two month period . Randomization and Stratification During the baseline/randomization visit , subjects will be randomized using the stratified randomization method prior to intervention by utilizing a web-based randomization system . Primary Endpoints The primary efficacy endpoint is to compare the acquisition of delay eyeblink conditioning between persons treated with NT-020 vs. placebo . The planned intervention period is two months . Eyeblink conditioning outcomes will be examined using a 2 ( group ; NT-020 , placebo ) X 6 ( trial ) repeated measures ANOVA to examine differences in the acquisition of the conditioned response from the eyeblink conditioning . Secondary Endpoint ( s ) Is the facilitation of the acquisition of the delay and trace human eyeblink response in the nutritional supplementation group mediated by changes in anti-oxidant markers ? In order to examine the mediation of the intervention group effects on eyeblink acquisition , we will adopt Baron and Kenny 's approach to regression-based statistical mediation . In this model , there are several requirements that must be satisfied in order to claim statistical mediation . We will examine whether intervention group is associated with eyeblink acquisition , whether intervention group is associated with changes in biomarkers , as well as the critical step of whether the influence of intervention group on eyeblink acquisition is reduced or made not statistically significant by the inclusion of changes to biomarker values in the regression analysis . Evaluate the effect of NT-020 treatment on changes in paper and pencil measures of cognitive performance : A 2 ( time ; baseline , two-months ) X 2 ( group ; NT-020 , placebo ) ANOVA will be computed on each of the cognitive test scores . The presence of a group X time interaction will suggest that the two groups exhibit differential change across the two time points .",2013-10-09,"June 2, 2014","Inclusion Criteria : Adults 65-85 years of age ( inclusive ) .

Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai,NCT01965925,Targeting Circadian and Cognitive Dysfunction in Bipolar Disorder With Modafinil,Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai,4,1,Bipolar Disorder,Drug,Modafinil,Treatment,Triple,"This is an 8-week , randomized , placebo-controlled trial of modafinil in stable bipolar disorder patients . Results will provide information on a promising treatment for simultaneously treating both sleep and cognitive problems in stable bipolar patients . These disabling symptoms persist despite stable mood and are strongly associated with functional disability , making them important treatment targets that have not yet been adequately addressed .","Changes in the sleep-wake cycle are other circadian rhythms represent core features of Bipolar Disorder ( BD ) , with sleep abnormalities in approximately 90 % of patients during acute episodes . Even when euthymic , many BD patients continue to demonstrate circadian disruptions , including diminished sleep efficiency and lower daytime activity levels ( Plante , 2008 ) . Moreover , unaffected offspring of BD patients demonstrate sleep and activity abnormalities ( Ankers , 2009 ) , and variation within several circadian-related genes ( e.g . CLOCK ) has been associated with risk for BD ( Dallaspezia , 2009 ) . These trait-like circadian disruptions are of particular clinical relevance as chances in sleep are highly predictive of impending affective instability ( Plante , 2008 ) and BD patients with poor sleep quality report diminished quality of life ( Gruber , 2009 ) . Psychosocial treatments that incorporate the regulation of sleep and activity in BD have been successful in reducing recurrence , highlighting the important of stabilizing circadian rhythms in BD ( Frank , 2005 ) ; yet treatment remains suboptimal and , to date , no pharmacological intervention using circadian measures as outcomes in BD has been published . The exact nature of the circadian abnormality in BD is known ; theories posit a potential uncoupling of the biological clock from external variables that entrain circadian rhythms ( e.g . light ) versus the desynchronization of the sleep-wake cycle such that it falls out of phase with other biological rhythms ( Dallaspezia , 2009 ) . Euthymic BD patients are commonly characterized by an eveningness chronotype , such that their time-to-sleep preference is phase-shifted to a later than average hour , one that is not typically aligned with the 24-hour light-dark cycle ( Plante , 2008 ; Ahn , 2008 ) . Potential consequences related to these persistent circadian abnormalities include significant reductions in daytime wakefulness and neurocognitive impairment . While sleep deprivation induced by single-trial phase-shifts only impairs cognition until sleep in recovered , chronic deprivation such as those noted in BD individuals , have been implicated in significant learning and memory deficits in animal models ( Craig , 2008 ) . Moreover , humans who are unable to synchronize normal sleep-wakefulness schedules with their own internal biological clocks are impaired on tasks of processing speed , working memory , and learning ( Wright , 2006 ) . Indeed , a majority of BD patients demonstrate deficits in attention , memory , and executive function even when affectively stable ( Goldberg & Burdick , 2008 ) . Although several features of the illness potentially contribute to the persistent cognitive impairment noted during euthymic periods , the circadian-based deficits in sleep quality and daytime wakefulness are likely to exacerbate cognitive problems in BD ( Giglio , 2010 ) , as has been shown in healthy controls , sleep disordered subjects and other clinical conditions ( Benca , 2009 ) . Preliminary data support this relationship in BD . The possible influence of chronic circadian disruption on cognition in BD is of critical importance because of a strong association between cognition during euthymic and functional disability ( Sanchez-Moreno , 2009 ) . When considering agents that may simultaneously improve upon sleep quality and enhance cognition , the wake-promoting agents , modafinil , is an ideal candidate . It is FDA approved for improving wakefulness in adults with excessive daytime sleepiness due to primary sleep disorders ( Provigil , 2007 ) and is characterized as a psychostimulant but has been differentiated from amphetamine by a lower liability for abuse and a more favorable risk profile . Modafinil has been shown to enhance cognition in healthy controls , sleep-disordered individuals , neurological patients , and patients with schizophrenia ( Minzenberg , 2008 ) . Preliminary data indicate that modafinil is safe and effective as an adjunctive in depressed BD patients , with no risk for mania-induction vs placebo ( Frye , 2007 ) ; however there has not yet been a systematic trial in euthymic BD patients with sleep and cognitive dysfunction as outcome measures . Thus , adjunctive modafinil ( 200 mg/day ) vs placebo will be administered to 48 euthymic patients with BD for 8 weeks with three specific aims : To evaluate the safety of adjunctive modafinil in euthymic BD . Adverse events will be carefully measured and recorded in an effort to determine the base rates for common side effects in BD . Specifically , mood and psychosis ratings will be conducted weekly to address the potential for modafinil to exacerbate manic and/or psychotic symptoms . To evaluate the effects of adjunctive modafinil in euthymic BD on measures of sleep quality and daytime wakefulness . Patients ' subjective experience of sleep disruption and daytime wakefulness will be measured weekly using several standard questionnaires and daily diaries . To evaluate the effects of adjunctive modafinil in euthymic BD on measures of neurocognition . Cognitive functioning will be assayed using the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery supplemented by several domain-specific tasks at baseline , 4-weeks , and at the end of the 8-week study .",2013-10-16,"March 20, 2018","Inclusion Criteria : DSM-IV Bipolar Disorder I or Bipolar Disorder II diagnosis Affectively stable Clinically acceptable , stably-dosed , mood stabilizing medication regimen for > 1 month prior to enrollment , with no medication changes planned over the 8-week study period .

The hypothesis is that protecting the throat is very useful in decreasing cough severity , both day and night , without needing to subdue such an important reflex as cough , and without only acting on mucous fluidification , especially in children where sedation and excessive fluidification is dangerous . The research hypothesis is that the protective ( Grintuss ) Syrup relieves cough ( frequency , intensity , degree of disturbance due to nocturnal cough , and improves the quality of sleep of the child ) as much as or more than the carbocysteine syrup usually used to treat children ( Syr Mucolit ) .","Cough is a life saving reflex , therefore it is important , especially in pediatrics , to calm cough spells without sedating the reflex . Mucolytic agents have been shown to be helpful but side effects have been reported and use has been prohibited under 2 years of age . Therefore , a completely safe and effective cough remedy has not been officially reported yet in a randomised trial . Looking into other mechanisms for cough management such as protection of irritated pharynx mucosa from post nasal drip or other irritating substances is theoretically sound and shows practical interesting results . A parallel comparison of efficacy and tolerability between such protective mechanism ( acting through a barrier and radical scavenging action ) due to natural substances ( honey , plantago lanceolata , grindelia robusta and helichrysum italicum ) and a mucolytic substance has not been done so far , in young children , especially in a time frame of 4 days . The intent of this study is to use the protective syrup versus carbocysteine in children with moderate to severe night and daily cough , measured with a validated parent questionnaire . The invasiveness of cough is followed immediately after one night administration of the study products and daily for four days .

In the United States , more than three million patients , and 700.000 in Italy , have cardiac failure and its most common cause is ischemic heart disease . The major goal to improve post infarction LV function would be the stimulation of neovascularization and the enhancement of regeneration of cardiac myocytes within the infarcted area . Recent experimental studies suggest that bone marrow-derived progenitor cells ( BMCs ) or circulating endothelial progenitor cells ( cEPCs ) contribute to the regeneration of infarcted myocardium , to enhance neovascularization of ischemic myocardium , to prevent cardiomyocyte apoptosis , to alter scar formation by reducing the development of myocardial fibrosis and , thereby , to improve cardiac function . G-CSF is a hematopoietic cytokine produced by monocytes , fibroblasts and endothelial cells . G-CSF is known to have multiple functions in normal , steady-state hematopoiesis . It is routinely used to mobilize CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells from the BM into peripheral blood , thus enabling their easier collection compared to BM aspirate procedure . The proven efficacy and safety of G-CSF , both in healthy donors and patients with haematological disease , along with favourable results from studies of CD34+ cell transplantation in patients with MI or ischemia , suggest that G-CSF based BMC transplantation may have an efficacy in patients with MI .",2013-10-22,"February 2, 2021","Inclusion Criteria : Patients affected by acute anterior ST elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) or PCI-rescue with persistent occlusion of coronary artery , Time symptom-to-balloon ( ≥3 h and ≤12h or ≤24 h if symptoms persist ) , Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction ( TIMI ) flow post PCI ≥2 , Evidence of left ventricular ( LV ) dysfunction ( EF biplane ≤45 % ) ≤24 h after revascularization , Men and women aged ≥18 years and ≤75 years , Informed consent must be signed before proceeding with any study procedure .

During the OPT we give increasing doses of the allergen to the patient and evaluate threshold causing a clinical reaction . This test is associated with a risk of strong allergic reaction and need a medical supervision . Standard allergy test , like skin test or specific IgE test , ca n't be use for the diagnosis of these allergy . Some publications demonstrate that these tests lack sensibility and specificity for child food allergy diagnosis . New tests have to be develop to diagnosis child food allergy without risks . The BAT is a cellular test able to evaluate the basophiles activation by specific allergen in vitro .

It is already used in drug allergy and it has been evaluated in infant milk allergy in an other clinical trial . In this study we want to evaluate the sensitivity of BAT to the diagnosis of child food allergy compare to the gold standard test OPT . We will evaluate the BAT on 140 children with food allergy and compare this results with the OPT at the same time . If the BAT results can predict the sensitivity of children to food allergen , it could limit the use of the OPT and reduce the risk of this test .","Child food allergy represent 6 to 8 % of child in industrialised country .

Rancé evaluated the prevalence of these allergy to 6.7 % of school child . Within the food allergen , peanut , egg and milk are the most common . Currently , there is two diagnostic possibilities : A strong allergic reaction with identified allergens and specific IgE positive , making it highly probable diagnosis . A moderate allergic reaction with only suspicion on the allergen , without definitive diagnosis . When there is a suspected allergy , the gold standard to the diagnosis is the OPT . This test consist of the gradual ingestion of the suspected food allergen to evaluate the threshold causing a clinical reaction . The OPT must be performed under medical supervision in a hospital due to the risk of severe allergic reaction . The OPT is the gold standard in allergy diagnosis . The other tests ( prick test , IgE specific measure… ) are not sensitive enough . Furthermore , the level of IgE specific was not related to the risk to develop clinical reaction to the food allergen .

University of Florida,NCT01966692,Sensitivity of Pharmacokinetics to Differences in Aerodynamic Particle Size Distribution,University of Florida,1,1,Asthma,Drug,Fluticasone Propionate Formulation 1,Other,Double,"When a drug company first develops a drug , the company has to show the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) that the drug is safe and effective . If FDA concludes that the drug is safe and effective , FDA approves the drug . The company can then sell the drug , which the company does using `` trade name . '' Only the drug company that developed the `` trade name '' drug is allowed to sell it . However , other drug companies can create their own version of the `` trade name '' drug , which usually happens after the patents for the `` trade name '' product run out . These drugs , often called `` generic drugs , '' potentially will be less expensive for the patient . In order to sell generic drugs , drug companies must show that their generic version is the same as the `` trade name '' drug in a number of ways . For example , they generally have to show that their product is intended to be used to treat the same diseases or conditions , that it has the same label , and that the product has the same active ingredient as the `` trade name '' drug . The generic company also has to show that generic product is `` bioequivalent '' to the trade name drug , meaning that the generic product gets to the part of the body where the drug works at the same rate that the trade name drug does . How to show how much drug gets to the part of the body where it works , and how fast , depends on the type of product the drug is . The primary aim of this research study is to aid the FDA in finding methods to ensure that the versions of generic drugs that are inhaled ( for example , drugs used to treat asthma ) are bioequivalent to the trade name drug . As a part of the research study , pharmacokinetic ( PK ) studies ( studies measuring drug levels in the blood over time after inhalation ) will be done using three different versions of fluticasone propionate ( FP , a drug routinely used in asthmatic patients ) administered using a dry powder inhaler ( DPI , an inhalation device that delivers the drug as a dry powder ) . The results from this study will help FDA ensure that generic products are the same as the trade name drugs .","Formulation Development The aim of the pharmaceutical development was to manufacture three Dry powder Inhalation ( DPI ) formulations containing Fluticasone Propionate in an Plastiape Monodose DPI device , which provide distinct in vitro deposition patterns on a Next Generation Impactor . NGI is a high performance cascade impactor used to characterize aerosol particles by particle size . It is desirable to develop three formulations with the same emitted dose ( ED ) , impactor size mass ( ISM ) but different mass median aerodynamic diameter ( MMAD ) . Meeting these design criteria for the formulations would help to see if pharmacokinetic parameters are sensitive to regional differences in drug deposition whilst having the dose deposited in the lung from different formulations being the same.The three formulation developed are labeled Fluticasone Propionate Drug formulation 1 through 3 . Study Procedures and scheduling The study is comprised of 5 visits in total - a screening visit and 4 treatment visits . At least 5 days should lapse between the treatment visits . Screening Visit During the screening visit , the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be reviewed to ensure the volunteer is appropriate for the study . The informed consent will be reviewed with the volunteer by a member of the study team and the volunteer will be encouraged to ask questions to ensure the volunteer has a good understanding of the study . If the volunteer is eligible and agrees to participate , the volunteer will be asked to sign the informed consent form prior to any study specific procedures including randomization . After the volunteer signs the informed consent , the volunteer will be interviewed and demographic data , medical history and concomitant medications will be collected and recorded . A physical examination will be performed after the vital sign measurements are obtained . A pregnancy test for female volunteers will be obtained . Spirometry testing and inhalation training will be performed by a qualified study clinician/investigator to ensure the suitability of volunteers . Laboratory tests including a Complete Blood Count ( CBC ) , urinalysis and metabolic panel will be collected via venipuncture and processed in the lab . Screening tests will be performed within 14 days of treatment visit 1 and no later than 2 days before treatment visit 1 . All screening results will be evaluated by the study clinician/investigator against the inclusion/exclusion criteria to confirm the eligibility of the volunteers . Inhalation training : Inhalation training will be performed by a qualified study clinician at the screening visit and at each study visit . The training will be accomplished by instructions and subsequent inhalation via training devices containing empty capsules . The instructions on how to use the device correctly are similar to the Foradil Aerolizer DPI product information label . ( http : //www.rxlist.com/foradil-drug/medication-guide.htm ) Treatment Visits 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 Eligible volunteers will be asked to return for treatment visit 1 . A minimum period of 5 days should lapse between the subsequent treatment visits . Each treatment visit is scheduled for 28 hours over two days . The study will be conducted at the University of Florida ( UF ) CRC ( Clinical Research Center ) . It is an outpatient study and the volunteer will be asked to come back the following day for the 24 hour blood sample . The volunteer will be asked to stay in an outpatient room during the treatment visit . The same activities are carried out at the other treatment visits . At each treatment visit , eligibility criteria will be reviewed and confirmed to ensure volunteer is appropriate for study . Changes in medical history including concomitant medications will be documented . Vital signs will be obtained . Inhalation training will be provided to the volunteers as mentioned in the section above . An IV catheter will be inserted in a vein located in the forearm region of the volunteer . The IV catheter is used to avoid multiple pricks while collecting blood samples . The IV catheter is not used for the administration of the drug . The volunteer inhales 5 times from a given inhaler during each treatment visit . Each inhaler will be used only once and by only one volunteer to ensure the volunteer 's safety from infectious agents . The schedule below summarizes the procedures performed at the screening visit and a single treatment visit . Blood sample collection Blood samples will be drawn by inserting an indwelling catheter into the volunteer 's median cubital vein in the forearm region .

The shape of the pharynx changes during the head and neck movement and there is probably also a change in the force transmitted to the cuff along the airway tube . Besides , there is evidence that supraglottic airway device can be displaced with rotation . In this article , the investigators want to discuss about that oropharyngeal leak pressure and sealing between the mask and vocal cord while changing head and neck position in perioperative period using different types of supraglottic airway device .","The investigators select adult patients , who are 20-80yrs old and ASA physical status I or II , receiving minor surgery , ex : breast surgery or cystoscope , participated in this randomized cross-over trial .

However , live oral enteric vaccines ( e.g . OPV , cholera vaccines , typhoid vaccine ) have been less immunogenic in poor communities with high levels of malnutrition and poor sanitation . Rotavirus vaccines also appear to be less immunogenic in the setting where they are most needed . High maternal antibody ( IgG ) to rotavirus and breast feeding near the time of vaccination may inhibit rotavirus vaccine effectiveness . We propose a quick study to look at practical ways to improve the immunogenicity of rotavirus vaccine in our own setting in Bangladesh . The objectives are to assess if delaying Rotarix vaccination will improve the immune response to the vaccine and to assess if avoiding breastfeeding in the 45 minutes before and after vaccine administration will improve the immune response to administration of Rotarix vaccine . The study will be conducted in the urban Dhaka Mirpur Community , a setting where previous rotavirus vaccine immunogenicity studies have been successfully conducted . A total of 300 infant will be randomly assigned to one of the following groups : 1 ) Administration of Rotarix at 6 and 10 weeks co-administered with oral polio virus vaccine with no intervention in normal breastfeeding practices before and after receiving vaccine . 2 ) Administration of Rotarix at 6 and 10 weeks co-administered with oral polio virus .

"International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh",NCT01821586,Modified ORS Solution for Severely Malnourished Children,"International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh",2,1,Malnourished Children With Watery Diarrhoea,Other,Modified ORS-1,Treatment,Quadruple,"Diarrhoea and malnutrition are the common childhood illnesses responsible for higher deaths in developing counties . Physiologically , malnourished children excrete lower amounts of salts and water in diarrhoeal stools , and they also are unable to handle excessive salts and water load . Some times they are found to be hyponatraemic due to the shift of sodium inside the cells ( inefficient Na+ /K+ pump ) , and fluids containing higher amounts of sodium ( such as the standard ORS ) may lead to further increase in the intracellular sodium , fluid overload and heart failure . They also have depleted in potassium stores in the body . Recently , the WHO recommended a special ORS formulation , known as ReSoMal , for management of diarrhoea in severely malnourished children that contains a lower amount of sodium ( 45mmol/L ) and higher amount of potassium ( 40 mmol/L ) than the standard WHO-ORS . It is felt that an ORS containing lower sodium and higher potassium concentration may be useful in correcting hypokalemia , and in lowering the risks of excess sodium and /or overhydration , in severely malnourished children with diarrhoea . The safety of ReSoMaL is , however , still in question due to the risk of hyponatraemia , including symptomatic hyponatraemia , especially in the treatment of severe watery diarrhoea due to Vibrio cholerae and ETEC where loss of sodium in the stool exceeds than that is contained in ReSoMal . Thus an ORS solution with modest concentration of sodium ( 75 mmol/L ) and higher concentration of potassium ( 40 mmol/L ) have been suggested for the treatment of diarrhoea in these children . To improve the efficacy of oral rehydration , in terms of reducing the severity of purging and diarrhoea duration , different approaches ( changing the substrates/ reducing the sodium and glucose concentration and osmolarity ) have been tried with limited success . Benefiber ( partially hydrolysed guar gum ) , a soluble fiber if added to a ORS solution is expected to be fermented in the colon liberating short chain fatty acids ( SCFAs ) . SCFAs stimulate sodium and water absorption from the colon , and they have trophic effect , act as a fuel source for the colonocytes , have antibacterial properties and stimulates the production commensal flora , thereby may enhance recovery from acute diarrhoea in severely malnourished children . The aims of our proposed study are to examine whether an ORS solution with a modest concentration of sodium will prevent the occurrence of hyponatraemia including symptomatic hyponatraemia , and also whether addition of benefiber will improve the efficacy of ORS solution . This will be a randomized , double blind , controlled clinical trial in 186 children with severe malnutrition and watery diarrhoea ( 62 in each of the three treatment groups ) to compare the efficacy of ( i ) the currently recommended ORS with some modofication ( Na+ 75 mmol/L and K40 momol/L and minerals-Zinc , copper and magnesium ) , ( ii ) ReSoMal ( Na+ 45 mmol/L ) , ( iii ) Currently recommended ORS ( Na+ 75 mmol/L , K 40 momol/L and added minerals ) with added Benefiber ( 25 grams/L ) , in the treatment of acute watery diarrhoea in children with severe malnutrition","Study Design This will be a randomized , double-blind , controlled clinical trial to assess the efficacy of three different modified ORSs : ( i ) Currently recommended ORS with some modification ( Na+ 75 , K 40 mmol/L and added minerals ) ; ( ii ) Resomal ( Na+ 45 ) ; ( iii ) Currently recommended ORS ( Na+ 75 , K 40 mmol/L and added minerals ) with added benefiber ( 25 grams/L ) in the treatment of acute watery diarrhoea in children with severe malnutrition . STUDY POPULATION Children of either sex , aged 6 months to 3 years , presenting with acute watery diarrhoea of < 7 days duration will be screened . Sample Size The sample size of this study has been determined based on the followings : Persistence of hyponatraemia : We anticipate that 10 % of the children will remain hyponatraemic in the Modified ORS-1 treatment group compared to 30 % children in the Modified ORS-2 ( ReSoMal ) . Assuming 5 % level of significance and 80 % power , the sample size in each group is 60 . Recovery from diarrhoea : In a recent clinical trial33 of ORS solution in severely malnourished children with acute watery diarrhoea , the mean +SD duration of diarrhoea was 66 ( 32 ) h. We anticipate that a 25 % reduction in the diarrhoea duration in children receiving Benefiber-added ORS . Considering 5 % level of significance and 80 % power the required sample size in each group is 59 . Anticipating a drop out of around 5 % we need 62 children in each group . Randomization After enrolment into the study the patient will be randomized to receive one of the following three solutions : Case Management : Following the standardized protocol for management of severely malnourished children used at ICDDR , B hospital 20,23 . 5.1 Fluid therapy ( oral ) Dehydration will be assessed according to the WHO guidelines , modified for in our last multicentre clinical trial of reduced osmolarity ORS in adult cholera and children with watery diarrhoea ( 17 ) . In children with some dehydration , the fluid deficit will be corrected with the assigned ORS @ 10ml/kg/hr for the first two hours , then 5ml /kg/hr until the deficit will be corrected . In addition , on going stool looses will be replaced @ 5-10 ml/kg/hr after each watery stool . For high purging patient , the ORS intake will be adjusted according to the ongoing stool loss . ORS therapy will be continued until diarrhoea ceased . Children with severe dehydration , initial rehydration will be done with IV fluid ( cholera saline ) until the patient is out of shock or disappearance of signs of severe dehydration then the rest of the rehydration will be done as for rehydration in patients with some dehydration as described above . 5.2 Management of infection : Children without apparent extraintestinal infection will receive Inj ampicillin 100 mg/kg.24 h in 3 divided doses and Inj . Gentamicin @ 5ml/kg.24 h in 2 divided doses for 5 days . Children with lower respiratory tract infection will receive Inj . Ceftriaxone 75 mg /kg.day for 5 days , and those with cholera will receive syrup Azithromycin 20 mg/kg once within 20 minutes of randomization . 5.3 Diet : Mothers will be advised to continue breastfeeding . Supplementary feeding with milk suji ( milk , rice powder mixture , energy 70 kcal/100ml ) will be given 10 ml/Kg.feed two hourly for day 1 and increased slowly up to 150 Kcal/Kg.day over 7 days according to demand . If the child has poor appetite , or is weak , or has painful stomatitis or glossitis , food will be delivered through nasogastric tube until able to take food orally . Additionally , semisolid foods ( Rice , lentil , vegetable etc . ) will be given to older children during convalescent and rehabilitation phase . 5.4 Vitamin and Mineral Supplements Children older than one year without xeropthalmia will be given 200,000 units of vitamin A and those 6-12 months age will be given 100,000 units of vitamin A on admission . Children with xeropthalmia will receive the same dose on three occasions : on admission , on the following day , and at discharge .

Georgetown University,NCT01821430,Increased Sensitivity to Pain Caused by Opioids in People Who Have Abused Prescription Opioids,Georgetown University,2,0,Chronic Pain,Drug,Pregabalin,Treatment,Quadruple,"Managing pain in patients who abuse prescription opioids presents many challenges , including the development of opioid-induced hyperalgesia ( OIH ) . Hyperalgesia is a condition in which something that usually feels slightly painful is perceived as something very painful . The proposed study will test the efficacy of the well-known neurological medication pregabalin to diminish OIH and chronic pain in persons who are in Suboxone ( buprenorphine ) or methadone treatment for prescription drug abuse .","The clinical management of pain in prescription opioid abusers presents a challenge to the health care professional . Investigators have novel pilot data showing that the GABA-agonist gabapentin ( GPN ) significantly decreases opioid-induced hyperalgesia ( OIH ) in methadone patients ( Compton et al. , 2009 ) , providing the first empirical evidence of a pharmacotherapy for OIH in opioid abusers . The work of Gore and colleagues ( 2011 ) showed that pregabalin ( PGB ) , a GABA analogue succeeding GPN , was shown to decrease opioid use in patients with neuropathic pain in patients , suggesting an anti-hyperalgesia effect not observed in the matched cohort receiving GPN . The proposed research will comprehensively evaluate the efficacy of PGB in treating opioid-induced hyperalgesia ( OIH ) in a well-described population of prescription opioid abusers ( POAs ) with chronic pain and on Suboxone ( buprenorphine ) or methadone therapy . A pressing need for such investigation is presented by the rising number of POAs presenting for treatment ( SAMHSA , 2010 ; 2011 ) , and for whom , chronic pain is a common co-morbidity . The proposed work is anticipated to provide vital and timely information on the efficacy of PGB in the treatment of OIH in prescription opioid abusers on Suboxone or methadone therapy . Following recruitment and screening , 75 subjects assigned to the active medication group will receive pregabalin 400 mg/day , a dose well-within published guidelines of 300-600 mg/day for the treatment of neuropathic pain ( http : //www.pfizerpro.com/hcp/lyrica/phndosing ) . During the first week of treatment , subjects will be quickly titrated up to the assigned daily PGB dose of 400 mg/day PO ( 50mg BID x 2 days ; 100mg BID x 2 days ; 150mg BID x 2 days , with full dosage of 400mg administered on day 7 ) , or maximum dose tolerated ) for six weeks . 75 subjects will be assigned to receive matched and undergo identical titration and study activities under double-blind conditions . Study staff will evaluate subjects daily by phone during titration ; thereafter they will be seen weekly at study sessions . Tapering of medication will begin at the end of week 6 . The severity of chronic pain will be measured at each time point using two standardized self report tools which report on pain severity ( McGill Pain Questionnaire ) and pain-related disability ( Brief Pain Inventory ) . Opioid-induced hyperalgesia will be measured at each time point using a standardized cold pressor trial , and performance at baseline will be compared to performance following PGB/placebo administration over time .",2013-03-27,"February 7, 2017","Inclusion Criteria : Be between the ages of 21 and 65 years of age .

St. Louis University,NCT01825577,Exploring the Use of Transdermal Methylphenidate to Reduce Fall Risk in Patients With Dementia.,St. Louis University,4,0,Dementia,Drug,Transdermal Methylphenidate,Prevention,,"Falls in the elderly are a very common and serious health problem with devastating consequences . Those with dementia are 5 times more likely to experience falls than older people without significant cognitive impairment . Despite a growing awareness and the use of available treatments , the number of falls and fall related injuries continue to increase . It is important to develop more effective treatments to help reduce the number of falls and prevent injury . The assessments used in this study determine fall risk which predicts the likelihood of falls in the future . This study will evaluate the possible role of Methylphenidate , Ritalin , in preventing falls and improving symptoms of apathy , or indifference . Methylphenidate is FDA approved for the treatment of ADHD but is not currently approved by the FDA for preventing falls or improving apathy ( lack of interest ) in the elderly . The methylphenidate used in this study will be absorbed through the skin by wearing a small patch near the hip area . The specific primary aim of this open label study is to determine if use of transdermal Methylphenidate ( t-MPH ) causes a reduction in fall risk in patients with dementia . The hypotheses to be tested is that after receiving t-MPH for 4 weeks , subjects will show improvement in gait and mobility assessment scores when compared to gait and mobility scores at screening .","This is an open label pilot study ; consenting subjects with dementia and identified as a fall risk , who meet inclusion criteria will undergo 3 phases of involvement . Phase 1 is a 1 week period before initiating study drug . Phase 2 is a 2 week treatment period with 10mg of Transdermal Methylphenidate . Phase 3 is the final two week treatment period with 15mg of Transdermal Methylphenidate . Measurements obtained at each phase will include : Vital Signs ( blood pressure and pulse rate ) weight , Timed Get Up and Go Test ( TUG ) , Tinetti Performance Oriented Mobility Assessment ( POMA ) , Clinical Apathy Evaluation Scale ( AES-C ) and the St. Louis University Mental Status Examination ( SLUMS ) . The primary endpoint is the change in TUG and POMA scores at end of phase 3 compared to beginning of phase 2 Falls are a cause of substantial morbidity and mortality in patients with dementia and occur at twice the rate of older adults without cognitive impairment . The consequences of falls in older adults with dementia are serious ; fallers with cognitive problems are approximately five times as likely to be admitted to institutional care as people with cognitive problems who do not fall . [ 3 ] They are also at high risk of major fall-related injuries such as fractures and head injuries that increase mortality risk . Walking requires paying attention to various environmental features and recovering from postural variations to avoid stumbles or falls . Consequently , deficits in attention and executive function are independently associated with risk of postural instability , impairment in activities of daily living , and fall risk . Executive function refers to higher cognitive processes that allocate attention among tasks and a critical cognitive resource for normal walking . Lower scores on executive function measures are associated with both dementia and a higher fall risk . Although significant progress towards understanding the factors involved in falls has been made , the number of falls and fall related injuries continue to increase . Changes in aging demographics are expected to dramatically increase the aging population and dementia prevalence , underscoring the importance of developing more effective fall prevention strategies . Recent studies have shown that improving certain aspects of cognition , specifically attention and executive function , in older adults can improve mobility decline and risk of falls . Particularly in cognitively impaired individuals , this may be critical to reducing fall risk . Why Methylphenidate ? Pharmacological properties of psychostimulants , such as methylphenidate ( MPH ) , are known to increase executive function . Methylphenidate was chosen because of the studies demonstrating the safe use of MPH for treatment of depression and apathy in the cognitively impaired elderly and the well-studied effects of MPH on executive function and attention in children and adults with ADHD . Also a small study published in April 2008 in J Am Geriatric Society , evaluated the use of methylphenidate in reducing fall risk among community living older adults . The study concluded that among study subjects receiving methylphenidate , significant improvement in mobility and gait assessments were observed as well as drug tolerability . The basis for our study is to further explore the pharmacotherapeutic role of Transdermal-MPH in reducing fall risk in dementia patients . Mobility and gait assessment performance is strongly correlated with fall risk . Therefore we will use subject 's scores before , during and after medication administration to measure response and evaluate use as a fall prevention strategy .",2013-03-13,"June 26, 2018","Inclusion Criteria : 65- 95 years of age Ability to ambulate ( may use walking aid ) Male or Female Clinical diagnosis of Dementia Identified as fall risk by nursing staff Exclusion Criteria : Clinically significant musculoskeletal , cardiovascular or respiratory diseases .

The secondary objectives of the study are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of lofexidine by evaluating and monitoring pharmacokinetics ( amounts of drug in the blood ) , vital signs ( heart rate and blood pressure ) and adverse events ( side effects ) when co-administered with buprenorphine ; to describe effects on opiate withdrawal when lofexidine is introduced following a 50 % buprenorphine dose reduction , as required to elicit a withdrawal response ; and to evaluate QTc interaction effects of lofexidine compared with placebo . The Investigators hypothesize that while lofexidine is known to prolong the QTc interval , the combination of the drugs will not create an additive effect which creates a significant safety concern . The Investigators further hypothesize that subjects will be able to tolerate the therapeutic dose of lofexidine ( 0.8 mg four times daily ) when the buprenorphine maintenance dose is lowered to elicit withdrawal .","This will be a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled multiple ascending dose study to assess the safety , tolerability , and electrocardiographic effects of lofexidine in 30 buprenorphine-maintained adult subjects . The study will include a Screening Visit , an Inpatient Treatment Visit , and a Follow-Up Visit . Subjects will be randomized in 4:1 ratio to receive up to 4 tablets of lofexidine ( 0.2 mg/tablet ) QID or 4 tablets matching placebo QID . Subjects who are on a stable dose of total daily sublingual buprenorphine 16-24 mg/day with or without naloxone ( Suboxone® or Subutex® , respectively ) , 16 - 24 mg/day , and who satisfy inclusion and exclusion criteria will be eligible for the study . Subjects who are eligible for the study will be encouraged to begin shifting their medication dose to a total daily dose at 2 PM in anticipation of the study dosing schedule during the Inpatient Treatment Visit . Subjects who are receiving Suboxone tablets or Subutex at study enrollment will be converted to Suboxone film at the inpatient check-in and will receive Suboxone sublingual film throughout the study . Within 21 days of the Screening Visit , subjects will report to the inpatient study facility to begin the Inpatient Treatment Visit which will last between approximately 11 to 21 days . This visit will include an inpatient check-in ( 1 day ) , Buprenorphine Baseline ( 1 day ) , Initial Lofexidine Titration ( 3 to 5 days ) , 1 or 2 Lofexidine Plateaus ( 2 to 4 days ) , Buprenorphine Reduction ( 2 to 6 days ) and Buprenorphine Re-Titration and Discharge ( 2 to 4 days ) . The order of steps subjects will proceed through during the Inpatient Treatment Visit will vary depending on whether subjects are able to titrate to the highest dose of lofexidine or placebo during the Initial Lofexidine Titration . The highest dose of lofexidine ( or placebo ) will be 4 tablets QID ( 0.2 mg lofexidine per tablet or placebo ) for a total daily lofexidine dose of 16 tablets ( 3.2 mg or placebo ) . During the Buprenorphine Baseline phase subjects will take a single daily dose of buprenorphine at 2 PM . Buprenorphine Baseline Day study assessments will begin at approximately 7 AM and include electrocardiogram ( ECG ) monitoring , blood collection for buprenorphine pharmacokinetics , and opiate withdrawal assessments ( Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale , COWS and Short Opiate Withdrawal Scale , SOWS ) . The next day subjects will proceed to the Initial Lofexidine Titration phase . Subjects will continue using their baseline buprenorphine dose . Lofexidine will be initiated at 2 tablets ( 0.4 mg or placebo ) QID and titrated in daily increments of a single tablet ( 0.2 mg or placebo ) QID to a total daily dose of 0.8 mg QID ( or placebo ) , if tolerated by the subject . Lofexidine doses will escalate daily unless at any point the subject meets protocol-defined dose hold criteria ( described below ) , which will trigger a reduction in dose to the previous highest tolerated dose ( or to the 1 tablet dose , 0.2 mg or placebo , if subjects can not tolerate the initial 2 tablets , 0.4 mg or placebo ) . Once subjects have titrated to the highest dose ( ie , 4 tablets QID ) or once the highest tolerated dose has been determined , they will proceed to a 2-day Lofexidine Plateau phase during which they will continue to receive their buprenorphine maintenance dose . If the subject is unable to titrate up to 4 tablets QID ( 0.8 mg or placebo ) , the subject will continue to receive their highest tolerated dose in equal increments ( eg , 2 or 3 tablets QID at 8AM , 1PM , 6PM , 11PM ) for both days of the plateau . Subjects who tolerate 4 tablets QID ( 0.8 mg or placebo ) on the first day will receive the 4 tablets QID ( 0.8 mg or placebo ) according to the normal dosing schedule . On the second day , the lofexidine dosing schedule will be modified with subjects receiving a 1-tablet increase ( ie , 0.2 mg or placebo ) of the 1 PM lofexidine dose ( 5 tablets : 1 mg or placebo ) and a 1-tablet reduction ( 0.2 mg or placebo ) in the subsequent lofexidine dose ( 3 tablets : 0.6 mg or placebo ) with the other 2 doses of 4 tablets ( 0.8 mg or placebo ) for a total daily dose of 16 tablets ( 3.2 mg/day or placebo ) . On the second day of the Lofexidine Plateau phase , subjects will undergo ECG monitoring and blood collection for buprenorphine and lofexidine pharmacokinetics . COWS and SOWS assessments will be performed on both days of the Lofexidine Plateau . Subjects who are titrated to a daily dose of 4 tablets ( 0.8 mg or placebo ) QID while receiving their full dose of buprenorphine will undergo a 4-day buprenorphine dose reduction of 50 % while continuing to take lofexidine or placebo at a daily dose of 16 tablets to evaluate the effects of lofexidine on buprenorphine withdrawal signs and symptoms . These subjects who complete the initial Lofexidine Plateau at a dose of 0.8 mg lofexidine ( or placebo ) QID and who reach a COWS of 5 or greater prior to the fourth day of the reduced buprenorphine dose administration may proceed early to Buprenorphine Re-titration and Discharge at the Investigator 's discretion . If the COWS score does not reach 5 within 4 days , the subject will proceed to Buprenorphine Re-titration and Discharge . Subjects who are unable to titrate to the highest lofexidine dose ( 4 tablets : 0.8 mg or placebo QID ) while receiving their full dose of buprenorphine will undergo a buprenorphine dose reduction of 50 % for up to 6 days while continuing to receive their highest tolerated dose of lofexidine from the initial titration . On the fourth day ( or earlier at the investigator 's discretion based on withdrawal response ) , lofexidine titration will resume by adding an incremental 1 tablet ( 0.2 mg or placebo ) QID to the previously established tolerated dose up to the maximum 4 tablet ( 0.8 mg or placebo ) QID dose . During these subsequent titration attempts lofexidine ( or placebo ) doses will escalate daily beginning on the fourth day of the reduction ( or earlier based on discretion of the investigator ) unless in any event a subject meets protocol defined dose-hold criteria ( described below ) , which will trigger a reduction in dose to the previous highest tolerated dose and will require the Lofexidine Plateau procedures described above to be repeated while maintaining the subject on their newly reduced buprenorphine dose ( eg , 50 % of their maintenance dose ) . Subjects who are unable to titrate to a higher lofexidine dose during the 50 % Buprenorphine Reduction than the dose they titrated to during the Initial Lofexidine Titration will not repeat the Lofexidine Plateau procedures . During Buprenorphine Reduction , COWS and SOWS assessments of opiate withdrawal will be performed . On days when the lofexidine dose is increased , holter monitoring and pharmacokinetic ( PK ) sampling will be done for those subjects who did not titrate all the way up to the maximum dose of lofexidine during the initial titration period . Following completion of the Lofexidine Plateau ( repeated as necessary ) and Buprenorphine Reduction , subjects will begin the Buprenorphine Re-Titration and Discharge phase during which lofexidine or placebo will be discontinued and buprenorphine will be re-titrated to the starting dose ( or to a higher or lower dose relative to baseline as medically indicated at the discretion of the investigator ) . Lofexidine may be used to treat withdrawal symptoms , if necessary . Following successful buprenorphine titration and completion of study assessments , subjects will be discharged from the inpatient study clinic . Subjects will return to the study clinic for a follow-up visit 7 days ( ±2 days ) following clinic discharge for safety follow-up and adverse event collection . Subjects will be discharged from the study at this time unless they are medically unstable on their dose of buprenorphine . Subject may be medically followed at a regular interval , as determined by the investigator , until the subject is considered sufficiently stable for study discharge . Subjects who withdraw consent or meet any one of the following study termination criteria prior to completion of the study will be withdrawn . Study termination criteria will apply only to pre-dose sitting vital signs and the daily safety ECG readings ( excluding HR ) . Baseline values for vital signs and ECG readings refer to values obtained at the time subjects are admitted to the clinic . 1.Cardiovascular events including the following * : a.

Most of the patients affected require for survival chronic red blood cells transfusions to overcome ineffective erythropoiesis . Unfortunately , all chronically transfused patients become clinically iron overloaded as there is no physiological mechanism for the removal of iron from the body . The pathologic changes and clinical manifestations associated to chronic iron overload are common among all transfusional iron-overload patients , albeit best documented in patients with beta-thalassemia major . The recommended treatment consists in regular blood transfusions combined with chelating therapy to remove the harmful iron accumulation in the body . Currently , in the clinical practice particularly in children and adolescents , the criteria leading to the choice of the chelating agent include also the adherence to therapy , thus favouring the use of oral chelators ( Ceci A et al. , 2011 ) DFP ( Deferiprone ) was the first oral chelator authorised in Europe in 1999 as second line treatment for the treatment of iron overload in patients with thalassaemia major when DFO ( Deferoxamine ) is contraindicated or inadequate . However , despite a wide experience of DFP with iron overloaded ( specifically thalassaemic ) patients , limited data are available for younger children .

The condition is often accompanied by other features such as fatigue , stiffness , cold intolerance , cognitive impairment , intolerance to external stimuli , sleep disturbances , anxiety and depression , which significantly affect the quality of life . Fibromyalgia is characterized by altered pain perception , and studies have shown fibromyalgia to be more prevalent in patients with iron deficiency anemia . Iron is essential for a number of enzymes involved in serotonin and dopamine synthesis . Deficiency of serotonergic neuronal functioning might be related to the pathophysiology of FM . A dysregulation of dopaminergic transmission in the pathophysiology of FM has also been suggested . This has brought forth the postulation that iron as a cofactor in serotonin and dopamine production may have a role in the etiology of FM . A number of therapies are currently in vogue for FM , both pharmacological and non-pharmacological . Drugs shown to be effective in FM include tricyclic antidepressants ( amitryptiline , cyclobenzaprine ) , dual reuptake inhibitors ( duloxetine , milnacipran ) and alpha-2-delta ligands ( pregabalin , gabapentin ) . However cost is a major factor , and often treatment results are disappointing . Hence the investigators planned to conduct a randomized controlled trial of iron therapy in fibromyalgia . IF proven , iron could be a cheap and easily available alternative for the treatment of this common and often disabling condition . Materials and methods : Patients with FM attending the OPD of the Department of Clinical Immunology will be identified . Diagnosis shall be made as per the ACR 2010 preliminary diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia and measurement of symptom severity . After seeking informed consent , the subjects will undergo baseline investigation to look for Hb , thyroid function tests and 25-OH-Vitamin . Patients with a Hb40 will be taken up for study . Baseline depression will be assessed using BPHQ and patients with a baseline BPHQ > 4 will be excluded from study . Following this , the patients will undergo assessment of serum ferritin at baseline , and irrespective of serum ferritin levels , will be randomized into 2 groups . Target sample size in each group will be 60 . The groups will be blinded from both the patients and the investigators , and allocation concealment will be maintained by use of pre-sealed envelopes and drug packets . Group A will receive standard of care treatment for fibromyalgia ( Amitryptiline up to 25 mg/day , Duloxetine upto 60 mg/day , Pregabalin upto 300 mg/day either singly or in combination ) along with placebo for 3 months . Group B will receive standard of care treatment for fibromyalgia ( Amitryptiline upto 25 mg/day , Duloxetine upto 60 mg/day , Pregabalin up to 300 mg/day either singly or in combination ) along with 230 mg of oral elemental iron daily for 3 months . Assessment at baseline and at 3 months will be done with respect to the primary end points - Widespread Pain Index ( WPI ) , Symptom Severity Scale score ( SSS ) , Hindi version of Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire ( FIQ ) , and secondary end points - Visual Analog Scale for pain ( VAS ) , Hindi version of Brief Physical Health Questionnaire ( BPHQ ) , Hindi version of SF-36 questionnaire . Patients will be monitored for side effects of oral iron therapy ( nausea , vomiting , gastrointestinal irritation , constipation , diarrhea ) . At the end of 3 months , statistical analysis will be done to determine significance of difference between placebo groups A and B with respect to the above mentioned end points . Patients with a change in FIQ > 25 % will be taken as responders . The change in levels of various end points before and after , viz . WPI , SSS , VAS , BPHQ , SF-36 will be a secondary consideration .

Children's Mercy Hospital Kansas City,NCT02360826,Statin Distribution,Children's Mercy Hospital Kansas City,1,1,Drug Distribution,Drug,Pravastatin,Treatment,,"Anticipating an increased use of statins in children and adolescents , it is imperative that we understand the genetic and developmental characteristics affecting the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of statins in childhood and adolescence . Simply extrapolating pediatric dosing guidelines from adult dose-exposure-response relationships fails to recognize the potential impact of growth and development in pediatric patients , which may have important clinical implications for drug efficacy or toxicity . Current evidence indicates that genetic variation in the SLCO1B1 transporter is important for statin disposition and toxicity in adults . The ontogeny of SLCO1B1 during human growth and development has not been well characterized , and limited pediatric data indicate that the genotype-phenotype relationship in children is the opposite of that observed in adults . Therefore , investigating the relative roles of SLCO1B1 ontogeny and genetic variation in statin disposition and response is key to determining the age at which the statin dose-exposure-response relationship mimics adults , and has important implications for other medications transported by the SLCO1B1 protein . As the first step in this process , our specific aims for the current investigation are 1 ) to determine the effect of genetic variation of SLCO1B1 on the pharmacokinetics of pravastatin and simvastatin by comparing Cmax , AUC and elimination between children and adolescents with 2 functional SLCO1B1 alleles and those with one or more variant alleles , and 2 ) to determine if the magnitude of the genetic effect on pravastatin pharmacokinetics ( defined as Cmax , AUC and elimination ) is equivalent to the effect on simvastatin pharmacokinetics . As a secondary aim , Cmax and AUC of pravastatin and simvastatin will be compared between children and adolescents for each genotype group . These results will be utilized to determine the sample size necessary to adequately power future studies characterizing the role of ontogeny on statin disposition . The ultimate goal of this proposed investigation is to establish the role of genetic variation in key transporters on the dose-exposure relationship of two commonly used statin drugs in children . This study is the first step in a series of investigations aimed at determining the mechanisms behind variations in physiologic response , clinical efficacy and significant adverse effect risk that surround the statin drugs in children and adolescents .","The ultimate goal of this proposed investigation is to establish the role of genetic variation and development in key transporters on the dose-exposure relationship of two commonly used statin drugs in children . This study is the first step in a series of investigations aimed at determining the mechanisms behind variations in physiologic response , clinical efficacy and significant adverse effect risk that surround the statin drugs in children and adolescents . Research Design and Methods 1 . Trial Design 1.1 . Investigational Agents Pravastatin 20 mg tablet ( ages 8-13 years ) , 40 mg tablet ( > 14 years ) Simvastatin 10 mg tablet ( ages 8-17 ) , 20mg ( > 17 years ) Commercial supplies of pravastatin and simvastatin that are FDA approved for use in pediatric dyslipidemia will be used . Pravastatin and simvastatin from the same source and lot will be used for all subjects . The doses designated above are chosen according to previous adult and pediatric data 26 , 28-32 , 41 and are consistent with current labeling for pravastatin and simvastatin . Although fixed doses within a pre-specified age range will be used , dose data will be analyzed corrected for weight ( mg/kg ) based on the patient 's weight at time of dosing . 1.2 . Risk/Benefits All subjects with a LDL > 130mg/dl ( 95 % percentile ) will be eligible for this study , consistent with current clinical criteria for statin therapy . The risks associated with participation in this single-dose pharmacokinetic study are expected to be minimal given the known adverse event profile for the study articles and also , the limited exposure . The most common mild adverse effects of statins are headache , myalgia , and gastrointestinal symptoms ( abdominal pain , dyspepsia , diarrhea , constipation ) . However , in children these adverse effects occur with the same frequency as placebo 14 , 15 , 18 . Rare adverse effects include elevation of hepatic transaminases and myopathy , but these are generally observed with chronic treatment . Furthermore , no cases of hepatic failure with statins have been reported to date 52 . There is also a small risk associated with placement of the intravenous ( IV ) catheter that will be used to draw serial blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis and screening/safety labs . Finally , there is the risk of loss of confidentiality for the participating subjects . Methods to protect PHI and data handling are specifically outlined in the CMH CPR protocol Sections 4 & 5 ( CMH IRB # 12040220 ) . All of the above risks associated with this non-therapeutic clinical trial are minimal . There is no direct benefit to participating subjects , although there may be benefit for children in the future as it is expected that the information to be gained from the study can be generalized to the larger population of pediatric patients who may require statin treatment . The purpose of the study is to determine how genetic variation impacts pravastatin and simvastatin plasma concentrations following recommended doses of the drug in a patient population that has not previously been studied . Thus , with this knowledge , future protocols could subsequently be developed to effectively `` personalize '' dosing for pediatric subjects with the aforementioned SNPs who are taking pravastatin or simvastatin , thereby improving efficacy and safety for the individual patient . 1.3 . Study Design/Type This will be a single center , open label , randomized , cross-over study in patients with dyslipidemia comparing the pharmacokinetics of pravastatin and simvastatin , in patients with greater than or equal to one variant allele in the SLCO1B1 gene ( -11187 and/or c.521 ) to patients with the wild-type/wild-type genotype . 1.4 . Population Sample The CMH Cardiology Pharmacogenomics Repository ( CPR ) ( CMH IRB # 12040220 ) database will be accessed to determine subjects meeting inclusion criteria . Once the target population and an equal set of age- , sex- and Tanner Stage-matched controls are identified , the patients will be invited to participate in a single center , open label , randomized , cross-over , pharmacokinetic study of pravastatin and simvastatin . 1.5 . Subject Recruitment Once a target population and an equal set of age- and sex-matched controls are identified from the CPR , prospective participants will be informed about the study . Initial contact will occur by way of a prepared telephone script . Those that agree to participate will be scheduled for a visit to the CMH Clinical Research Unit for a screening visit . At this visit , the study will be explained to the patient/patient 's family , permission/assent/consent will be obtained , a physical examination ( including Tanner staging ) , and screening laboratory testing will be performed . Participants for whom permission/assent/consent has been obtained and inclusion criteria are met , will be scheduled to come back to the CMH Clinical Research Unit within 6 to 14 days for the first study drug day . 1.6 . Subject Withdrawal Participation in the pharmacokinetic trial of pravastatin and simvastatin is completely voluntary . As part of the informed permission/assent/consent process ; subjects are informed that they can withdraw their permission/assent/consent at any time . If at any time , study subjects have social , philosophical , religious or family concerns related to the study , they may decide to withdraw permission/assent/consent . A study subject or an authorized third party ( PCP ) may revoke permission/assent/consent at anytime . The request to revoke permission/assent/consent may be made verbally or in writing and addressed to study personnel ( as indicated in the permission/assent/consent form ) . Study personnel will take appropriate steps to respect the will of the study subject and ensure that the study subject is able to withdraw without having a compromise in personal integrity or medical evaluation/treatment . In the event permission/assent/consent to continue is withdrawn after partial collection of samples or data , only existing data will be analyzed and tabulated . The subject can be withdrawn from the study by the investigators , if at any point , in the judgment of the investigators , that the subject 's continued participation may be associated with the production of unanticipated risks ( e.g. , a late onset hypersensitivity reaction following administration of the study article ) . 1.7 . Subject Study Visits The study will involve three total visits . One screening visit and 2 drug study day visits . Screening Visit ( Approximately 1 hour ) -Upon arrival for the screening visit , the study will be reviewed in depth with the participating subject and subject 's parents/legal guardian when applicable . They will be provided sufficient time to review the permission/assent/consent form , have all questions answered , and concerns addressed . If they agree to participate , they will sign the permission/assent/consent form . -Following permission/assent/consent , screening labs will be drawn . If the patient is unable to complete the study labs at this time , a time will be arranged to have these performed at least 1 day prior to Study Drug Day # 1 . The laboratory evaluation will consist of the following . Research chemistry panel ( Sodium , Potassium , Chloride , Carbon Dioxide , Anion Gap , Calcium , Phosphorus , Magnesium , Glucose , BUN , Creatinine , Total Protein , Albumin , Bilirubin , ALT , AST , Alkaline Phosphatase , GGT , LDH , Cholesterol , Uric Acid and Triglyceride ) ( 3 mL blood in mint green or red top with yellow ring gel tube ) Complete blood count with differential ( 1 mL in a 3 mL EDTA lavender top tube or 250 uL in a microtainer ) Creatine phosphokinase ( 0.2ml in gel mint green or red top w/ gold ring ) C-reactive protein ( 1 ml of blood in a mint green or red top tube w/ yellow ring gel ; or EDTA ) . -If the patient is currently taking a statin , they will be asked to discontinue this agent until after the completion of the entire study . -Finally , scheduling of the subsequent study days will take place at this visit . Study Drug Day # 1 will be scheduled 6 days and up to 14 days following the screening visit . Study Drug Day # 2 will be scheduled 6 days and up to 14 days following Study Drug Day # 1 . Drug Study Day # 1 ( Approximately 10 hours ) -Upon arrival to the Children 's Mercy Hospital Clinical Research Unit , the subject will have a screening physical examination including Tanner staging . For females , a urine specimen will be obtained for beta-human chorionic gonadotropin pregnancy test . -Once cleared to participate , the subject will have an indwelling , silastic cannula ( 21 or 24 Ga ) placed in a peripheral vein on the hand or forearm for the purpose of repeated blood sampling to support the pharmacokinetic aims of the study . Patency of this cannula will be maintained throughout the study period using a sterile solution of heparinized saline . -A single oral dose of either simvastatin or pravastatin will be ingested with 150ml of tap water after an overnight fast . The sequence of statin administered will be randomized between the two study visits . For two hours following study article administration , subjects will remain fasted with only small sips of water permitted . A standard , age-appropriate heart healthy meal will be served 2 hours after statin administration and a snack will be served in the afternoon of the study day . Water will be permitted ad libitum . In the event that the patient vomits within 2 hours of ingestion of Study Drug Day # 1 , they will be withdrawn from the study for that day and rescheduled . The subject will be rescheduled up to 14 days after the screening visit . If they are unable to be rescheduled within 14 days of the original screening labs , the labs will be redrawn that day . In the event that the patient vomits within 2 hours of ingestion of Study Drug Day # 2 , they will be withdrawn from the study for that day and rescheduled . The subject can be rescheduled 6 days and up until 14 days after Study Drug Day # 1 . If a more than 14 days , but no more than 21 days have transpired since Study Drug Day # 1 , the subject can be rescheduled , but must have repeated screening labs performed . Serial venous blood samples ( 1.5 ml each ) will be drawn from the indwelling venous cannula to measure plasma drug and drug metabolite levels of the ingested drug before ingestion ( time 0 ) , and at 0.5 , 1 , 1.5 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 , and 8 hours post ingestion . Should the patency of the indwelling cannula be lost , it will either be placed or alternatively , remaining blood samples will be obtained by sterile venipuncture at the desire of the study subject . After the samples are drawn , they will be placed into glass tubes containing potassium EDTA and gently mixed by repeated inversion . They will then be immediately centrifuged at 4ºC for a total of 10 minutes at 600g ( ~2000RPM ) and will immediately be placed in an ice bath to be transported to the Clinical Pharmacology Laboratory where they will be processed . The cellular component of the time 0 samples will be retained for future isolation of leukocyte DNA . The plasma component of each of the repeated blood sample obtained to support the pharmacokinetic objectives of the study will be removed by manual aspiration and transferred to a labeled , polypropylene cryovial which will be placed at -80ºC where it will be stored until analysis . Once the 8 hour post-dose sample is taken , blood ( 5.2 ml ) for study safety labs will be drawn , the IV cannula will be removed , and the patient will be discharged from the Clinical Pharmacology unit after the Drug Study Day # 2 is confirmed with the study subject and/or subject 's parent ( s ) . Drug Study Day # 2 ( Approximately 10 hours ) -Following a minimum of 6 days and up to 14 days after the first drug ingestion day ( wash out period ) , the subject will brought back to the CMH Clinical Research Unit for another single dose pharmacokinetic study . Following a physical examination and insertion of a peripheral IV cannula , the alternate statin that was not administered on the first drug study day will be given with 150 ml tap water after an overnight fast . The same blood sampling scheme will be used as described for study day # 1 . Blood for study safety labs will be obtained after the last drug level sample is drawn and the patient will then be discharged from the CMH Clinical Research Unit . The total amount of blood required for the entire study is summarized in the following table . Study Day Amount of Blood Screening Visit 5.2ml ( Screening Labs ) Drug Study Day # 1 13.5ml ( PK study labs ) 5.2ml ( Safety labs ) Drug Study Day # 2 13.5ml ( PK study labs ) 5.2ml ( Safety labs ) Total 42.6ml ( Over a 1 month period of time ) One week after completion of Drug Study Day # 2 or in the event of early withdrawal , the family will be contacted via telephone to screen for post-study adverse events as defined section 5 . 1.10 . Randomization The proposed study is a single-dose pharmacokinetic study comparing two statin drugs , simvastatin and pravastatin . The sequence of administration of the two statins will be randomized for each study participant . The Children 's Mercy Hospital Investigational Drug Service ( IDS ) Pharmacy will be responsible for the randomization procedure and will maintain control of the sequence randomization . This is an open label study , so neither the investigators nor subjects will be blinded to the sequence randomization . 2 . Laboratory Evaluation 2.1 . Drug and Metabolite Analysis After ingestion of a single statin dose , the corresponding drug and its metabolites will be quantified . Pravastatin is administered in its active , open acid form and does not have any significantly active metabolites 27 . The most common inactive metabolite isolated in plasma is 3 ' α-isopravastatin and it is formed non-enzymatically primary in the acidic conditions of the stomach 53 . Therefore , after pravastatin ingestion , serial plasma levels of pravastatin acid and 3'alpha-isopravastatin will be assessed . ( Additional details of plasma sampling intervals are outlined in Section 1.9 ) . Simvastatin is administered in its inactive , lactone form and undergoes hydrolysis to the major active metabolite which is beta-hydroxy simvastatin acid . Minor metabolites are 6'-hydroxy-simvastatin , 3'hydroxy-simvastatin , 3 '' -hydroxy-simvastatin , 6'exomethylene-simvastatin , 6'-hydroxymethyl-simvastatin , and 6'-hydroxycarbonyl-simvastatin 25 . Several of these metabolites , when converted to their acid forms , have reported activities in dogs but seem to accumulate in the bile with little detectable in plasma 54 . Therefore , in this study , only serial plasma levels of simvastatin and simvastatin acid will be assessed . ( Additional details of plasma sampling intervals are outlined in Section 5.0 ) . Analytical strategies for the determination of simvastatin and simvastatin acid : Simvastatin and simvastatin acid will be determined using a high-throughput salting-out assisted liquid/liquid extraction ( SALLE ) method with acetonitrile and mass spectrometry compatible salts for simultaneous LC-MS/MS analysis as previously described 55 . This method has been extensively validated according to FDA guidelines , and more importantly , demonstrates minimal interconversion of simvastatin and simvastatin acid during sample preparation . A brief outline of the method is as follows . Plasma samples will be thawed at 4ºC in a temperature-controlled water bath , and kept at this temperature during the procedure to minimize analyte interconversion . To an aliquot of sample , a stable deuterated isotope-labeled internal standard of simvastatin and simvastatin acid ( Toronto Research Chemicals ) are added to allow stable isotope dilution mass spectrometry . The sample is then extracted by the SALLE procedure at pH 4.5 to minimize the interconversion of simvastatin between the lactone and acid form . The extract is stable in the autosampler for 33 hours at 4ºC , and will be analyzed by LC-MS/MS within this timeframe . Sample analysis will occur on a Waters TQ-S triple quadupole mass spectrometer coupled to a Waters Acquity Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatograph ( UPLC-MS-MS ) , utilizing the chromatographic conditions ( including column ) as previously described 55 . Simvastatin and its internal standard will be monitored in positive ion-mode utilizing the 450-285 and 453-285 transitions of the methyl ammonium adducts respectively . Simvastatin acid and its internal standard will be measured in negative ion-mode due to poor ionization in positive mode . Transitions for these analytes will be 435-319 and 438-319 . All plasma samples will be run in duplicate for each sampling time interval to assure validity . The remaining plasma not used in the analysis will be stored within the Clinical Pharmacology laboratory in dedicated freezers/refrigerators as outlined in the CPR Repository . Use of these samples for further study will be at the discretion of the CPR director as outlined in the CPR protocol ( CMH IRB # 12040220 ) . Analytical strategies for the determination of pravastatin and pravastatin lactone : A large number of analytical strategies for the determination of pravastatin and pravastatin lactone have been described in the literature 56-59 , however many of these are labor intensive and not as high throughput as the methodology presented for simvastatin . Due to the structural similarities between simvastatin and pravastatin it is highly likely that the analytical method for simvastatin can be adapted for the analysis of pravastatin and pravastatin lactone with minimal change . In the unlikely event that the simvastatin method can not be adapted to pravastatin and pravastatin lactone analysis , we will utilize the method presented by Vlckova et al 60 . 3 Assessment of Pharmacokinetics 3.1 Pharmacokinetic Parameters Pharmacokinetic analyses will be conducted using Kinetica version 5.0 ( Thermo Electron , Philadelphia , PA ) . Pravastatin , simvastatin , and metabolite plasma concentration vs. time data will be curve fit using a peeling algorithm to generate initial monoexponential parameter estimates . Final estimates of the terminal elimination rate constant ( delta z ) will be determined from an iterative , linear least squares regression algorithm . A model-independent approach will be used and parameters of interest determined as follows . Individual Cmax and Tmax will be obtained by direct examination of the plasma concentration versus time profile . The area under the plasma concentration versus time curve during the sampling period ( AUC0-n ) will be calculated using the mixed log-linear method where n refers to the final sampling time with quantifiable drug or metabolite concentrations . Extrapolation of the AUC to infinity ( AUC0-infinity ) will be achieved by the summation of AUC0-n + Cpn/delta z , where Cpn is the last observable plasma concentration calculated from the curve fit of the terminal slope of the plasma concentration vs. time curve and delta z is the apparent terminal elimination rate constant . Absorption and elimination half-life ( t½ ) will be calculated from the initial and terminal portions of the plasma concentration vs. time curve for each analyte of interest . In the case of metabolites , the corresponding half life term will be that used to denote metabolite formation . 4 Statistical Plan 4.1 Statistical Methods Pravastatin and simvastatin pharmacokinetic data for the study cohort will be examined initially using standard descriptive statistics ( i.e. , arithmetic mean , geometric mean , standard deviation , coefficient of variation , 95 % confidence limits ) . A repeated measures analysis of variance model will be employed to determine treatment , period , and sequence effects for the resultant primary and secondary pharmacokinetic parameter estimates . Pharmacokinetic parameters reflective of exposure ( Cmax , AUC0-n , AUC0-infinity ) will be log-transformed using the natural logarithm , the 90 % confidence intervals for the difference in the means calculated and the antilog of the confidence limits evaluated against the pre-established bioequivalence criteria as defined in our power calculations . The significance limit accepted for all statistical analyses will be alpha = 0.05 . The contribution of different alleles to variation in the pharmacokinetic parameters of pravastatin and simvastatin will be investigated with multiple regression analysis . The genotype class ( non-carriers and carriers ) will be treated as independent variables . For Aim # 1 , the pharmacokinetic variables for each drug will be compared between non-carriers and carriers of variant alleles using independent t-test . Similarly , for Aim # 2 , the ratio of each pharmacokinetic parameter in carriers to non-carriers ( e.g . AUCcarrier/AUCnon-carrier ) for pravastatin will be compared to the corresponding ratios following simvastatin administration . All analyses will be performed in SPSS version 18.0 ( SPSS , Chicago , IL ) . 4.2 Subject Population ( s ) for Analysis Previously studies have shown that highly hydrophilic statins , such as pravastatin , are more dependent on the OATP1B1 transporter compared to more lipophilic statins , such as simvastatin 41 , 45 . It is theorized that the upstream promoter region ( -11187 ) might have a more pronounced impact on the genotype-phenotype relationship as seen in the previous pediatric study 49 . Therefore , our study will be powered to observe a dose-exposure difference in -11187 allelic variants and wild-type/wild-type with pravastatin . There are anticipated to be 150 subjects enrolled in the CPR database meeting inclusion criteria . The frequency of SLCO1B1 SNPs ( -11187G > A , 7-8 % ) from previous adult studies 61 , suggests approximately ~19-22 heterozygous subjects ( according to the Hardy Weinberg Equation ) in the anticipated number of participants from the CPR database . With a 90 % participation/10 % attrition rate , there would be ~17-20 subjects . On the basis of previous data on the adult pharmacokinetics of pravastatin in the variant alleles described above 45 , a sample size of 18 in each group ( -11187G > A genotype and wild-type control ) will have 80 % power to detect a difference in means of -101.0 in AUC ( 0-∞ ) ( the difference between a Group 1 mean , m1 , of 102.7 and a Group 2 mean , m2 , of 203.7 , which is nearly a 2-fold difference ) assuming that the Group 1 standard deviation , s1 , is 69.1 and the Group 2 standard deviation , s2 , is 126.4 using a two group Satterthwaite t-test with a 0.050 two-sided significance level . Therefore , our target sample size is 18 subjects with SLCO1B1 -11187G > A allele . With age- and sex-matched controls , the total sample size is 36 subjects . 5 . Adverse Events An adverse event is defined as any unintended change in the body structure ( signs ) or body function ( symptoms ) , whether or not considered drug-related . During the entire duration of the study , subjects will be instructed to report all adverse events . All adverse events , whether volunteered , elicited , or noted on physical examination , will be recorded throughout the study , ( i.e. , from the time of the first dose administration on Day 1 up to 1 week after the entire study completion or subject withdrawal from the study ) . The severity of adverse events will be categorized as mild , moderate , or severe according to FDA guidelines . The Investigator will make a determination of the relationship of the adverse event to the study drug using a four-category system ( not related , unlikely , suspected , and probable ) according to FDA guidelines . A serious adverse drug experience is any adverse test material event occurring at any dose that results in any of the outcomes defined by the FDA . An unexpected adverse experience is any adverse experience that is not identified in nature , severity , or frequency in the current approved drug labeling or elsewhere in the general investigational plan . Any serious and unexpected adverse clinical event , whether or not related to the study drug , will be reported verbally to the primary investigators within 24 hours of notification . Subsequently , a Serious Adverse Event ( SAE ) Report Form will be completed and Children 's Mercy Hospital and Clinics Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) will be notified . A statement from the Principal Investigator outlining the details of the adverse reaction will accompany this form . Laboratory reports and other safety reports will be forwarded as they become available . NOTE : The term `` severe '' is often used to describe the intensity ( severity ) of a specific event ( as in mild , moderate , or severe myocardial infarction ) ; the event itself , however , may be of relatively minor medical significance ( such as a severe headache ) . This is not the same as `` serious , '' which is based on participant/event outcome or action criteria usually associated with events that pose a threat to the participant 's life or functioning . Seriousness ( not intensity ) serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations . Ethical aspects This study will be conducted according to US and international standards of Good Clinical Practice ( FDA regulations 21 CFR 312 for IND studies and FDA guidance E6 ) for all studies . Applicable government regulations and University of Missouri-Kansas City/Children 's Mercy Hospital and Clinics research policies and procedures will also be followed . This protocol and any amendments will be submitted to the Children 's Mercy Hospital and Clinics Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) for formal approval to conduct the study . The decision of the IRB concerning the conduct of the study will be made in writing to the investigator . All subjects and parent/legal guardians , when applicable , will be provided a permission/assent/consent form describing this study and providing sufficient information for subjects to make an informed decision about their participation in this study . This consent form will be submitted with the protocol for review and approval by the IRB . Formal consent/permission/assent will be obtained , using the IRB-approved forms , before a subject is submitted to any study procedure . The consent/permission/assent form must be signed by the subject or legally acceptable surrogate , and the investigator-designated research professional obtaining the consent .",2013-09-03,"July 18, 2017","Inclusion Criteria : Children 8-21 years of age LDL cholesterol > 130mg/dl ( > 95 % percentile ) Successfully genotyped for SLCO1B1 Willing to sign the assent/permission/consent form Exclusion Criteria : Underlying structural heart disease including congenital heart disease or acquired heart disease .

We will compare the effect of ACTH and intravenous methylprednisolone therapy on axonal injury following ON using OCT , a sensitive , reproducible and noninvasive tool to measure RNFL thickness . The primary outcome will be the average RNFL thickness at 6 months . Additional pre-specified statistical analyses will compare the difference in the mean RNFL thickness at 6 months in the affected eye between the IV methylprednisolone- and Acthar-treated groups , and the mean 6-month affected eye RNFL thicknesses adjusted for the baseline unaffected eye RNFL . The secondary outcome measure will examine the frequency of optic nerves with RNFL swelling between the IV methylprednisolone- and Acthar-treated groups at 1 and 3 months . A predefined exploratory outcome will compare the ganglion cell plus inner plexiform layer ( GC+IPL ) thickness at 6 months between treatment groups . Additional tertiary outcome will be the assessment of changes in fatigue , mood , visual function depression , and quality of life in patients with AON .

Cairo University,NCT01833858,Human Chorionic Gonadotrophin in an Antagonist Protocol,Cairo University,2,1,Infertility,Drug,Low dose HCG,Treatment,Triple,"A novel gonadotropin protocol for ovarian stimulation adds low-dose hCG ( 50- 200 IU ) as a source of LH ( luteinizing hormone ) in the late follicular phase . This regimen reduces the number of small pre-ovulatory follicles which could reduce the risk of OHSS ( ovarian hyper stimulation syndrome ) . Adequate ovarian hormonal levels , oocyte maturation , avoidance of a premature LH surge , and increased pregnancy rate are the other benefits of this regimen . HCG might also affect endometrial function , stimulate endometrial growth and maturation and enhance the endometrial angiogenesis . These effects could extend the angiogenesis . These results could lengthen the implantation Window . Inhibin A is a heterodimer protein and does not begin to increase until just after the increase in oestradiol in the late follicular phase , suggesting secretion by the dominant follicle . Inhibin A secretion is regulated by LH and is associated with paracrine/autocrine action on oocyte maturation . Moreover , it is related to follicular development and size , serving as a marker of follicular maturation after IVF cycles .However , the role of hCG supplementation during COH ( controlled ovarian hyperstimulation ) is still a matter of debate and more studies is needed . Thus , the objective of this trial was to investigate whether LH activity in the form of low dose hCG in GnRH ( Gonadotropin releasing hormone ) antagonist cycles would improve the quality of oocytes , level of inhibin A and endometrial vascularity .","60 women , where 30 of them will receive low dose HCG with rFSH ( group 1 ) , while the other 30 women will receive rFSH ( Recombinant Follicle stimulating Hormone ) with a placebo ( group 2 ) both using the antagonist protocol as a method of induction in ICSI .

Primary Hypothesis : We hypothesize that administration of quercetin ( 2g oral ) prior to a 100g maltose tolerance test ( MTT ) will result in a decrease in postprandial blood glucose at 60 minutes compared to placebo . Acarbose ( 100mg oral ) , a pharmaceutical alpha-glucosidase inhibitor , will serve as a positive control . Secondary Hypothesis : We hypothesize that administration of quercetin ( 2g oral ) will reduce the Area Under the Glucose Curve ( AUC ) for the 2 hours following a 100g MTT compared to placebo . AUC is hypothesized to be comparable between quercetin and Acarbose . Tertiary hypothesis : We hypothesize that administration of quercetin ( 2g oral ) prior to a 100g MTT will result in a smaller reduction in flow mediated dilation ( FMD ) measured as an increase in Reactive Hyperemia Index ( RHI ) at 90 minutes compared to placebo .","This is a phase II , crossover , double-blinded , controlled trial in 20 participants with type 2 diabetes designed to measure the effect of quercetin on glucose tolerance and postprandial endothelial function in comparison to placebo and Acarbose .

Xemed LLC,NCT01832363,Bronchial Thermoplasty for Severe Asthmatics Guided by HXe MRI,Xemed LLC,2,1,Asthma,Drug,HXe MRI guided treatment sequence for BT,Treatment,Double,The purpose of this study is to determine if the bronchial thermoplasty treatment can be guided through hyperpolarized xenon lung MRI .,"This study explores the feasibility of using hyperpolarized xenon ( HXe ) Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) as a diagnostic imaging agent to prioritize the order of airway treatment by bronchial thermoplasty , rather than the FDA approved pre-established treatment sequence that is performed today . The Alair® Bronchial Thermoplasty System is an FDA approved device clinically proven to be effective in treating severe asthma patients who are not well controlled with inhaled corticosteroids and long acting beta agonists . Bronchial thermoplasty ( BT ) is a procedure that reduces excessive airway smooth muscle by radio wave ablation , thus decreasing the ability of the airways to constrict during an asthma attack . The BT procedure is performed in three separate outpatient treatment sessions , each treating pre-established regions of the lungs . The sessions are separated by at least three weeks healing time . MagniXene® is pure xenon gas which is magnetically altered to become a contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging of the lungs . The subject inhales the hyperpolarized xenon while inside the MRI scanner and a highly detailed ventilation map of the lung spaces is acquired during a short breath-hold . By detecting unventilated regions and airway reactivity using HXe images , a prioritized scheme for performing bronchial thermoplasty can be elaborated to treat the most problematic airways within the first BT session . In this study the rest of the airway will be treated in the following two sessions , such that all the airways are treated in the end as in the standard procedure . This study will include approximately 30 patients clinically indicated to undergo bronchial thermoplasty . Half of the patients will be randomly assigned to receive HXe guided BT , while the other half will receive standard BT procedure . HXe images and clinical measures of asthma disease severity , such as Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire ( AQLQ ) , Asthma Control Test ( ACT ) , morning expiratory peak flow ( AM-PEF ) , pulmonary function tests ( PFT ) , will be acquired at three time points interleaved with the BT sessions : before BT , 12 weeks after first session of BT , and 12 weeks after the third session of BT ( approximately 36 weeks from baseline ) . HXe MRI will be repeated within the same day after bronchodilator treatment of the patient to establish airways reactivity . Additionally , a three-week follow up for HXe MRI will allow us to study temporal variability of HXe metrics . A total of six HXe imaging sessions ( distinctive days ) , each including at least four HXe images will be dedicated to each patient . The primary outcome of this study will be to determine whether the standard full BT treatment is superior to a single session guided treatment . The statistical metric will be the incremental change in the AQLQ score .",2013-03-28,"August 23, 2019","Inclusion Criteria ( bronchial thermoplasty ) : Males or females age 18 or greater and less than 65 .

Our hypothesis is : opioid-free total intravenous anesthesia with propofol , dexmedetomidine and lidocaine infusions for laparoscopic cholecystectomy may achieve comparable hemodynamic stability during laparoscopy , with lower postoperative analgesic consumption and incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting .","Patients are randomly allocated into two groups to have either opioid-free anesthesia ( Group DL ) with dexmedetomidine ( 0.6 mg/kg loading , 0.3 mg/kg/h infusion ) , lidocaine ( 1.5 mg/kg loading , 2 mg/kg/h infusion ) , and propofol infusions or opioid-based anesthesia ( Group RF ) with fentanyl , remifentanil ( 0.25μg/kg/min ) , and propofol infusions . Simple randomization was done using 80 opaque sealed envelopes , 40 for each group , indicating group assignment and describing the anesthetic protocol . Before anesthesia induction , an anesthesiologist will open the next envelope in the sequence to reveal the treatment allocation . This anesthesiologist will only prepare the study medications and will be involved in neither preoperative and postoperative data collection nor anesthesia management of the patients . The drugs will be delivered in 10 ml and 50 ml syringes labeled as `` loading '' or `` infusion '' respectively . To ensure proper blinding , the loading doses of drugs ( dexmedetomidine and lidocaine in Group DL or fentanyl and normal saline in Group RF ) will be calculated according to the patient 's body weight and diluted to a 10 ml volume labeled as `` loading-1 '' and `` loading-2 '' in order of administration . The infusion drugs ( dexmedetomidine and lidocaine in Group DL or remifentanil and normal saline in Group RF ) will be prepared in 50 ml syringes and labeled as `` infusion-1 '' and `` infusion-2 '' respectively . At the preoperative holding area , patients will be instructed in the use of the verbal numerical rating scale ( VNRS ) and patient controlled analgesia ( PCA ) pump . Same anesthesiologist ( MB ) who is blinded to the study groups will perform the anesthesia management of all procedures . On arrival at the operating room , standard monitoring will be applied consisting of ECG , noninvasive blood pressure , pulse oximetry and bispectral index ( BIS ) . After premedication with intravenous midazolam ( 0.03 mg/kg ) , baseline heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure ( MAP ) will be determined which are average of three consecutive measurements . Preoxygenation with 5 L/min of pure oxygen will be performed during administration of loading doses . Before induction , patients in Group DL received 0.6 μg/kg dexmedetomidine ( loading-1 ) diluted to a total volume of 10 ml and infused in 10 minutes . To avoid bias , patients in Group RF will receive 2 μg/kg fentanyl in same fashion . At the induction , dexmedetomidine or remifentanil ( 1 μg/ml and 50 μg/ml respectively , infusion-1 ) infusions 0.3 ml/kg/h will be started and lidocaine 1.5 mg/kg ( loading-2 ) in Group DL or normal saline in Group RF and propofol 1.5 mg/kg will be administered . Lidocaine ( 20 mg/ml ) or normal saline infusions 0.1 ml/kg/h and propofol infusion 10 mg/kg/h will be started immediately after loading doses . Vecuronium 0.1 mg/kg i.v . will be given to facilitate tracheal intubation . The lungs will be mechanically ventilated with a mixture of oxygen in air ( FiO2 : 50 % , tidal volume 7-10 ml/kg , respiratory rate 10-14/min ) to obtain an end-tidal CO2 ( EtCO2 ) value between 30-35 mmHg . Supplemental neuromuscular blockade will be achieved with vecuronium after assessment of neuromuscular function with train-of-four . Dexmedetomidine and lidocaine infusions in Group DL or remifentanil and normal saline infusions in Group RF will kept constant during surgery . Propofol infusion rate will be adjusted 3-12 mg/kg/h to maintain the MAP within ±20 % of the baseline value , and to maintain a BIS reading below 50 . The lidocaine or normal saline administration will be terminated after gallbladder extraction ( or 10 min before the end of surgery ) . Dexmedetomidine or remifentanil and propofol administration will be terminated during skin closure . All patients in both groups will receive 8 mg dexamethasone and 50 mg dexketoprofen trometamol i.v . after anesthesia induction and 1 g paracetamol i.v . after gallbladder extraction . Laparoscopic portals will be infiltrated with 20 ml 0.5 % bupivacaine including 1/80.000 adrenaline before skin closure . Surgery : Surgeons who are experienced in laparoscopic cholecystectomy will performed the operations using standard 4-trocar technique . A blunt-tipped 12-mm trocar will be used to access the peritoneal cavity . Pneumoperitoneum will be achieved with carbon dioxide , and intra-abdominal pressure will be maintained at 12-14 mmHg throughout surgery . Three additional 5-mm ports will be introduced and patients will be positioned in 30 degrees anti-Trendelenburg position and be rotated toward the left side to facilitate exposure of the gallbladder . After endotracheal intubation a nasogastric tube will be inserted and stomach content will be aspirated . At the end of surgery , the inflated carbon dioxide will carefully be evacuated by manuel compression of the abdomen . A PCA pump will be ready to use immediately after extubation . The PCA pump will set to deliver fentanyl i.v . with a bolus dose of 20 μg , a lock-out of 5 min , without continuous infusion and dose limit for 6 hours after surgery . Trained nurses , blinded to treatment allocation and with no access to the intraoperative records , will perform all outcome assessments in the postanesthesia care unit ( PACU ) and surgical ward . Pain scores will be assessed using the 11-point VNRS ( 0 corresponding to no pain and 10 to the worst imaginable pain ) . Transition from PACU to surgical ward will be considered to be safe when patient will achieved a Modified Aldrete Score ≥ 9 .

University of Iowa,NCT01977417,Inflammation Inhibition in Prediabetic Humans,Gary L. Pierce,2,0,Prediabetes,Drug,Salsalate,Treatment,Double,"Prediabetes , characterized by elevated fasting blood sugar or exaggerated blood sugar response to sugar ingestion , effects over 79 million adult Americans and is a precursor to the development of Type 2 diabetes . Importantly , approximately 42 % of Iowans ( 950,000 ) have diabetes and 32 % ( 670,000 ) have prediabetes with the majority of those with prediabetes going undiagnosed . Adults with prediabetes demonstrate early signs of cardiovascular and nervous system abnormalities and are at high risk for developing overt diabetes unless aggressive lifestyle ( weight loss , exercise ) or pharmacological interventions are employed . Interestingly , data in recent years has linked obesity and diabetes to chronic inflammation of the blood vessels and brain areas that regulate blood pressure . Therefore , the current study will test whether a commonly used aspirin-like anti-inflammatory drug called salsalate , will improve blood vessel health and nervous system dysfunction in adults with prediabetes . Eligible subjects will have measurements of blood pressure , blood vessel function in the arms and eyes , assessments of nerve activity , and blood samples taken before and after 4 weeks of ingesting an FDA approved aspirin-like drug called salsalate . The study is important because it will identify a potentially new pharmacological strategy to treat vascular and nervous system abnormalities in overweight and obese adults with early stage type 2 diabetes using an inexpensive , generically available drug with an excellent safety record that has been used for decades to treat chronic inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis . If proven effective , this will provide preliminary support for the concept of targeting inflammation as a new clinical approach to treating early diabetes related complications . Furthermore , the current pilot study will provide support for developing a larger clinical trial using salsalate that could potentially then be extended to patients with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease , as well as lead to the development of new anti-inflammatory agents with greater specificity for selective inflammatory pathways .","A total of 30 healthy men and women ages 18-79 years who are obese defined as body mass index ( BMI ) of 30 kg/m2 or greater and with prediabetes ( defined as fasting blood glucose between 100-126 mg/dl , a fasting blood glucose of 140-199 mg/dl at 120 min during an oral glucose tolerance test ; or HbA1C of 6-6.5 % ) will be enrolled and randomized to 4-5 weeks of salsalate or placebo in the study .

Providence Health & Services,NCT01970410,MAIN STUDY: SWITCH SUB-STUDY: SWITCH-JCV,Providence Health & Services,4,1,Multiple Sclerosis,Drug,teriflunomide,Treatment,,"MAIN STUDY : The purpose of this study is to determine if teriflunomide will be safe and effective to prevent relapses in patients with relapsing types of MS when switching from natalizumab to teriflunomide in patients at risk for PML . This is a two center interventional study of patients who have had 12 or more continuous infusions of natalizumab , who are anti-JCV-ab positive , and who had been free of clinical relapses during prior 12 months of natalizumab therapy who will be switching to teriflunomide . SUB-STUDY : To study the number of patients experiencing a reduction in the anti-JCV antibody Index value in patients who had received at least one dose of teriflunomide during participation in the SWITCH protocol ( main study ) .","MAIN STUDY : Teriflunomide ( TFM ) is the primary metabolite of leflunomide , which is marketed worldwide for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis . Teriflunomide inhibits dihydroorotate dehydrogenase ( DHODH ) , the forth enzyme in the de novo synthesis pathway of pyrimidines . Activated T-lymphocytes utilize both the de novo pyrimidine and salvage pathways of pyrimidines ribonucleotide synthesis.After mitogen stimulation , teriflunomide inhibits in vitro T cell proliferation , DNA and RNA synthesis and expression of cell surface and nuclear antigens that are directly involved in T-cell activation and proliferation . Natalizumab ( NTZ ) is a FDA approved treatment for relapsing-forms of multiple sclerosis ( MS ) with pivotal studies showing an annualized relapse-rate ( ARR ) reduction of 68 % , a reduction of new Gadolinium `` enhancing '' ( Gd+ ) lesions by 92 % and a reduction of disability of 42 % compared to placebo . NTZ is highly effective in controlling MS but the risk of developing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy ( PML ) increases with the duration of the use of natalizumab . It can have a serious and life threatening complication in about 1 in 500 to 1 in 250 patients who have had more that 18 infusions due PML and who have a detected antibody ( Ab ) for the JC virus . The risk of PML is much greater in patients who have had prior immunosuppressive ( IS ) treatment . The combination of detected anti-JCV Ab , duration of NTZ treatment of greater than 24 months and prior IS increases the risk of development PML to an incidence of 11 per 1000 treated patients . So there is a need to have an alternative MS disease modifying treatment ( DMT ) to use for patients at risk to develop PML from NTZ treatment that might be sufficiently effective for MS so as not to have the patients ' MS worsen while lowering or eliminating the risk of PML . SUB-STUDY : John Cunningham virus ( JCV ) is the responsible organism for the development of progressive multifocal encephalopathy ( PML ) . Multiple sclerosis ( MS ) patients treated with natalizumab ( NTZ ) , who have evidence of exposure to JCV have a significantly elevated risk , as high as 12/1000 patients , of developing PML , necessitating the elective transition of patients off NTZ . JCV is a member of the polyoma virus family , and closely related to BK virus . BK virus has been found to be a significant threat to destroy transplanted kidneys and there is growing evidence that treatment with leflunomide , the pro-drug of teriflunomide ( TFM ) clears BKV from the kidney . Main study assessed the clinical efficacy of TFM in MS patients transitioned off NTZ solely because they have evidence of exposure to JCV , as determined by the presence of serum anti-JCV immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) . Previous work by other investigators has demonstrated a close correlation between positive anti-JCV antibody titers and the presence of active JCV infection . There is evidence that JCV is closely related to its fellow polyoma virus BKV , and that BKV is cleared by treatment with the TFM pro-drug leflunomide , we propose to determine if treatment of the JCV antibody positive patients currently enrolled in the approved protocol results in reduction in , or reversion to negative , of the anti-JCV antibody titer as measured by the JCV antibody Index , a commercially available assay which is used internationally as the standard for evidence of JCV exposure in NTZ-treated patients .",2013-10-22,"January 26, 2023","MAIN STUDY Inclusion Criteria : Male and female patients , age 21 to 60 with relapsing forms of MS , treated with natalizumab for 12 consecutive months or longer with anti-JCV Ab positive during that time period .

Twenty-four hour urine collection will be obtained one day prior to the active study day . Prior to initiation of the study , subjects will be stabilized for at least one week on a no added salt diet ( 120 milliequivalents of sodium/salt per day ( mEq Na/day ) which will be maintained throughout the study period . Subjects will be admitted to the Clinical Research Unit ( CRU ) on the evening before the active study day . They will be able to order a no-added salt meal and will not have anything to eat after midnight until the last renal clearance blood draw the next day . Bladder scan will be carried out to assess for urine retention . On the active study day , subjects take their medications upon awakening , however , diabetics will hold their diabetic medications until after the last renal clearance test then they will be able to order a regular diet meal and take their diabetic medications . Subjects will be asked to drink 5ml/Kg ( milliliters per kilogram of body weight ) of water to insure sufficient urinary flow . A priming dose ( calculated according to body size ) of Iothalamate , to measure glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) and para-amino-hippurate ( PAH ) to measure effective renal plasma flow ( ERPF ) is infused , followed by a constant rate IV sustaining dose ( calculated according to estimated kidney function ) of Iothalamate or PAH . The subjects will be asked to empty their bladder spontaneously every thirty minutes .

In light of the results obtained in a limited number of randomized clinical trials in subjects with AAD and CDI in comparison with the widespread occurrence of these diseases , it is felt that the addition of a well-controlled clinical trial in a western environment would add value to support the use of a specific probiotic to counteract these diseases .","The prevalence of Clostridium difficile infection ( CDI ) has been on the rise in the United States , and in fact the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) identified CDI as one of the highest threats in its recent report on antibiotic resistance in the United States . This designation as an `` urgent threat '' highlights the need for immediate and aggressive action to prevent this infection . In fact , CDI has been reported as the most commonly reported pathogen causing healthcare-associated infections ( HAIs ) . A point prevalence survey of 183 hospitals in 10 states found that C. difficile comprised 12.1 % of HAIs , surpassing Staphylococcus aureus infections . Although most cases of CDI can be treated successfully with relatively safe and effective oral antibiotics ( i.e. , metronidazole or vancomycin ) , primary prevention of CDI is critical because up to one in five treated patients endures a relapse or reinfection , which can be difficult to treat ; infected patients serve as a reservoir for ongoing transmission within facilities ; implementation of contact isolation precautions for patients who have CDI can have deleterious consequences for the patient ; and , CDI can result in death or severe disease including those treated by colectomy . Because CDI is spread between patients , prevention of a single case should reduce the risk of exposure for other hospital patients . One of the main studies in this indication , being a quality improvement study conducted at Pierre Le Gardeur Hospital ( PLGH ) in province of Québec , Canada . Starting in 2004 , 10 years of surveillance data were reported from this hospital that administers Bio-K Plus to all antibiotic users . During the 10 years of observation , 44 , 835 inpatients received Bio-K+ , and the CDI rate at PLGH declined from 18.0 cases per 10,000 patient-days and remained at low mean levels of 2.3 cases per 10 000 patient-days . Additionally , 10-year data collected by the Ministry of Health in Quebec comparing the CDI rate between Quebec hospitals showed that CDI rates at PLGH were consistently and continuously lower compared with those at similar hospitals . In conclusion , adding Bio-K Plus as a standard treatment led to a dramatic and sustained decrease in the incidence of C. difficile infections at this hospital .",2013-10-25,"July 21, 2022","Inclusion Criteria Only subjects who meet the following inclusion criteria will be eligible to participate in the study : Are at least 18 years old Able to tolerate food intake Antibiotic treatment started less than 48hrs from admission into the study Have an expected hospitalization period of at least three days ( including subject '' s stay in the emergency room ) Speak and understand English and/or French .

National Multiple Sclerosis Center,NCT04268810,Prospective Trial Comparing Intravesical Chondroitin Sulphate 2% and DMSO in the Treatment of PBS/Interstitial Cystitis,National Multiple Sclerosis Center,4,0,Painful Bladder Syndrome,Procedure,Bladder instillations,Treatment,Single,"Painful bladder syndrome/interstitial cystitis ( PBS/IC ) is a disease of unknown origin with a significant impact on the quality of life . Next to oral treatment with tricyclic antidepressants or pentosan polysulphate , intravesical treatment can be used as well . The purpose of this treatment is to restore the protective lining of the bladder that consists of glycan structures ( GAG ) . Currently only dimethylsulfoxide ( DMSO ) is FDA approved for this . Several other compounds have been introduced . We want to compare a solution of chondroitin sulphate 2 % with the standard DMSO solution . We will compare the patient perception of benefit , but also pain scores , quality of life and micturition diaries .","A . Introduction Painful bladder syndrome ( PBS ) is a syndrome which is poorly understood . Patients usually report suprapubic pain related to bladder filling and also report urinary urgency and frequency . In a subgroup of patients , typical cystoscopic findings can be noted and this defines this subgroup as interstitial cystitis . ( Abrams et al . 116-26 ) The treatment of PBS/IC is empirical . Bladder hydrodistension under anesthesia , tricyclic antidepressants , antihistaminics and intravesical DMSO instillations are the only treatment for which some evidence exists in the literature . More than 150 other treatment modalities have been described . Most of them were poorly studied . ( Fall et al . 1-99 ) Intravesical treatment with DMSO has stood the test of time and is the only FDA approved intravesical treatment of PBS/IC . DMSO however is also used as a solvent in the chemical industry and is in fact used ' off label ' in this indication . ( Erickson 333-43 ; Emerson and Perezmarrero A136 ; Perez-Marrero , Emerson , and Feltis 36-39 ) One of the theories on which intravesical treatment is based , claims that the glycosaminoglycan layer , which protects the urothelial cells is damaged . DMSO , Chondroitin sulphate , hyaluronic acid and heparin have been used to repair the GAG layer with variable clinical success . ( Daha et al . 369-72 ; Daha et al . 987-90 ; Riedl et al . 717-21 ) Chondroitin sulphate seems to be promising , but comparative data are lacking . ( Gauruder-Burmester and Popken 355-59 ; Nickel et al . 56-60 ; Hauser et al . 2477-82 ; Nordling and van Ophoven 328-35 ) Assessing the outcome of such treatments is difficult . Objective parameters such as daytime and nighttime frequency may not always reflect the impact of the condition on the life of the patient . Patient reported outcome parameters are more frequently used to assess treatments in overactive bladder disease and in painful bladder research . Several validated questionnaires can be used to assess patients with PBS/IC . One of the most frequently used is the O'Leary-Sant questionnaire ( see annex 1 ) . Next to this questionnaire the Global Response Assessment will be used . This is a validated 7 point Likert scale comparing the current status of the patient to the pre-intervention status . This scale has been used in several other studies on PBS/IC . ( Nickel et al . 910-18 ; Baranowski et al . 33-36 ) Aim To compare the clinical effectiveness of intravesical chondroitin sulphate 2 % ( Uracyst ™ ) and DMSO 50 % in the treatment of patients with painful bladder syndrome B. Randomization A central randomization will be used . Participating centers will have to contact the trial office of the dept . of urology of the University Hospitals Leuven to randomize the patient to one or the other treatment , either by telephone 016/346692 or 016/348345 or by mail elza.goossens @ uzleuven.be or evelien.vankriekingen @ uzleuven.be . A block randomization per center will be done . The randomization list was generated on a web application ( www.randomizer.org ) to ensure an unbiased randomization schedule . C. Protocol of administration Patients that are enrolled in the study will receive one intravesical instillation of Uracyst or DMSO a week during 6 weeks . DMSO is prepared as a 50 % solution in 50cc physiologic serum . Uracyst will be prepared by the nurse or urologist administering the product . Uracyst is delivered as a 2 % sterile solution in 20cc vials . The instillation is done by a urethral catheterization . The catheter is withdrawn once the fluid has been instilled . The solution is kept in the bladder for at least 30 minutes . A simple instillation protocol is followed , meaning that the patient can move immediately after the instillation of the product . The product is eliminated by spontaneous voiding after 30 minutes . D. Safety Safety is assessed by monitoring adverse events at every visit . Anticipated adverse events are hematuria , algiuria , urinary tract infection and garlic odor ( for DMSO ) … E. Statistics Comparison of the mean GRA by T-test will be used for the primary endpoint . Appropriate statistical tests will be used for the secondary variables . To detect a 0.75 difference on the 7 point Likert scale , with 80 % power at 0.05 % significance 45 patients will be needed in each group .",2013-03-31,"February 11, 2020","Inclusion Criteria : Female and male patients from 18-75 years A history of symptoms of bladder pain/discomfort described as suprapubic pain related to bladder filling , accompanied by other symptoms such as daytime and/or nighttime frequency in the absence of infection or other pathology , with or without the typical cystoscopic findings of interstitial cystitis Patients willing and able to complete the necessary questionnaires Exclusion Criteria : Patients with transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder or other significant malignancy Pregnant women Breastfeading women Patients with significant bacteriuria Patients with hematuria Neurogenic bladder Patients with indwelling catheters Chronic bacterial prostatitis Currently receiving or having received investigational drugs thirty ( 30 ) days or less prior to screening Currently receiving or having had prior therapy with intravesical treatment ( eg .

The safety of Reparixin in the specific clinical setting was also evaluated . Background : The chemokine CXCL8 plays a key role in the recruitment and activation of polymorphonuclear neutrophils in post-ischemia reperfusion injury after organ transplantation . Reparixin is the first low molecular weight blocker of CXCL8 biological activity in clinical development . Thus , the use of reparixin may emerge as a potential key component in the sequentially integrated approach to immunomodulation and control of non specific inflammatory events surrounding the early phases of pancreatic islet transplantation in T1D patients .","Pancreatic islet transplantation has become a feasible option in the treatment of T1D which offers advantages over whole pancreas transplantation . Several strategies are being evaluated , including anti-TNFα , aimed to prevent early inflammatory events that limit islet engraftment . Among possible mechanisms CXCL8 could play a crucial role in triggering the inflammatory reaction and might represent a relevant therapeutic target to prevent early graft failure . Preliminary data obtained in transplanted patients recruited in the ongoing pilot trial coupled with the safety shown in human phase 1 and 2 studies provide a sound rationale for further development of reparixin in islet transplantation and prompted the conduct of this phase 3 clinical , multicentre , randomised , double-blind , parallel assignment study aimed at assessing the efficacy and safety of reparixin in preventing graft dysfunction after islet transplantation in T1D subjects .

National Institutes of Health Clinical Center (CC),NCT01814059,Sirolimus for Eosinophil-Associated Gastrointestinal Disorders,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID),1,0,Eosinophilic Gastroenteritis,Drug,sirolimus,Treatment,,"Background : Eosinophil-associated gastrointestinal disorders ( EGID ) are a group of related disorders that affect the esophagus , stomach , and bowel . There are two major types of EGID , eosinophilic esophagitis and eosinophilic gastroenteritis . They are caused by the body 's immune system being activated by food allergens , which then damages the gut wall . People with EGID have large numbers of eosinophils ( a type of white blood cell ) in their gut . EGID can cause difficulty swallowing , abdominal pain , or nausea . At present , there are no drugs specifically approved to treat EGID . Most adults who have EGID receive steroid therapy to manage the symptoms . However , long-term steroid use may cause other problems in the body . Researchers want to see if low-dose sirolimus can be used to treat EGID . Sirolimus is a drug used to prevent rejection of transplanted organs . It may be able to keep the body 's immune cells from being activated by food allergens and decrease the eosinophils . Objectives : - To see if low dose sirolimus is safe and decreases blood or gut eosinophils in EGID . Eligibility : Individuals between 18 to 65 years of age who have EGID . Participants must also have an elevated blood eosinophil count and positive blood tests for IgE antibodies to foods . Design : Participants who are on medicine for EGID or related symptoms must be on a stable dose for 1 month before screening and stay on that dose throughout the study . Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam , and review their symptoms . They will provide blood and urine samples . They will also have heart and lung function tests . Some participants may have allergy skin tests . At the first study visit , participants will have 2 days of inpatient tests . They will repeat the tests from the screening visit . They will also have a full analysis of the esophagus , stomach , and small intestine . On the second day , they will start to take sirolimus as a liquid with orange juice or water . Participants will continue to take sirolimus at home . They will record their doses and any symptoms . They will also have a visit to provide blood samples about 2 weeks after the first study visit . At the second study visit ( about a month after the first visit ) , participants will repeat the tests from the screening visit . The sirolimus dose may be adjusted as needed . Participants will take sirolimus for at least another 28 days . Depending on the dose of the drug and the blood test results , some participants may need to take it for up to 112 days . Those who take the drug for a longer period will have additional study visits with tests . There will be another study visit when participants stop taking the drug . The last visit will be a final follow-up visit .","Eosinophil-Associated Gastrointestinal Disorders ( EGID ) are a group of related disorders characterized by gastrointestinal symptoms and eosinophilic infiltration of the gastrointestinal wall . The 2 major forms of EGID , eosinophilic esophagitis ( EoE ) and eosinophilic gastroenteritis ( EG ) , differ in regard to the site of inflammation ( esophagus vs. stomach/small bowel ) . Both EoE and EG are highly associated with coexisting allergic disease , and a large fraction of EGID patients are sensitized to multiple food allergens . Existing data strongly support the concept that EGID is a food-allergen-driven , eosinophilic , inflammatory gut disease . Multiple lines of evidence support a major role for Th2 cells and the cytokines they express ( IL-4 , IL-5 , and IL-13 ) in EGID pathogenesis . There are presently no drugs with a labeled indication for EGID . Most adult patients are managed long-term with corticosteroid therapy , which raises concerns about toxicity . Sirolimus is an immunomodulator approved for use in preventing transplant rejection . It specifically inhibits Th2 cell proliferation in vitro , suggesting it may have activity in EGID . This study is a phase I open-label design intending to target a sirolimus whole blood concentration of 6 ng/mL for a duration of 56 days . Twenty adult EGID subjects 10 with EoE and 10 with EG with evidence of Th2-mediated IgE sensitization and peripheral blood eosinophil counts ( Bullet ) 800 cells/ L will be recruited to participate . Subjects will begin sirolimus at a dose of 1.2 mg/m2/day . Blood sirolimus level will be checked at 14- to 28-day intervals , and the dose will be serially adjusted in each subject as needed to target the 6- ng/mL target trough concentration . Blood will be drawn at each visit to monitor drug levels and safety labs .",2013-03-15,"July 3, 2018","INCLUSION CRITERIA : Individuals will be eligible for study participation if they meet all of the following criteria : Age greater than or equal to18 years and less than or equal to 65 years at the time of Study Visit 1 .

The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the feasibility , safety , and physiologic efficacy of field-initiated glyceryl trinitrate in achieving modest reduction of blood pressure . Patients with acute stroke will be identified in the field by paramedics who have received training in basic and advanced cardiac life support , stroke recognition , and specific procedures relevant to the proposed study . Physician-investigators will obtain informed consent for each subject for study entry after cellular phone contact with paramedics . Paramedics will initiate antihypertensive treatment by applying transdermal GTN patch in the first two dose-tiers , and administering a single sublingual GTN metered spray followed by application of the transdermal system in the last dose tier . The sites involved in the study will be emergency medical services rescue ambulances and 8 receiving Stroke Center hospitals in Orange County , California , USA .","The central aim of this phase 2a study is to identify a regimen of paramedic initiated glyceryl trinitrate antihypertensive therapy in acute stroke patients that is safe , is technically effective in modestly lowering blood pressure , and is optimal to advance to a pivotal trial . The study design is an open-label dose escalation study with three dose tiers , . It is anticipated that the trial will identify the most promising prehospital GTN regimen to advance to a pivotal , placebo-controlled , phase 3 trial . Primary Hypothesis : Prehospital glyceryl trinitrate treatment reduces severely hypertensive blood pressure elevation by ED arrival . The primary study endpoint to test this hypothesis will be the mean change in SBP from pre-treatment to ED arrival . Secondary Hypotheses : Prehospital glyceryl trinitrate treatment reduces severely hypertensive blood pressure elevation at early post-arrival timepoints and increases the proportion of patients with target blood pressure at ED arrival and early post-arrival timepoints . The secondary study endpoints analyzed to test these hypotheses will be : 1 ) mean change in SBP from pre-treatment to 30 minutes after ED arrival and 60 minutes after ED arrival ; and 2 ) the proportion of patients with SBP < 180 mm Hg at ED arrival , 30 , and 60 minutes after arrival . Prehospital initiation of glyceryl trinitrate in the first 2 hours for severely hypertensive patients with stroke is feasible and safe . Safety of GTN in the first 2 hours for severely hypertensive stroke patients will be assessed by analysis of serious adverse events , neurologic change , and mortality . We hypothesize that initiation of treatment of the patients in the field will be associated with a favorable side effect profile and without severe blood pressure lowering to les than 120 mm Hg systolic .

A primary driving force for this unbridled hemorrhage has been shown to be the early coagulopathy which complicates severe injury . Increasing evidence suggests that blood component transfusion protocols that address this early coagulopathy , once a patient arrives at a trauma center , are associated with lower mortality and a reduction in blood component transfusion requirements . Prehospital interventions which quell this early coagulopathy in an earlier setting have the potential to minimize or even prevent this vicious hemorrhagic cascade , further lowering blood component transfusion requirements and reducing the resultant morbid sequelae which complicates severe injury .

The dose of most drugs given to babies is based upon the baby 's weight , but some believe that the dose of atropine should not be less than 0.1mg . However there is no evidence to support this minimum dose . A larger dose of atropine may cause a very fast heart rate instead .

The duration of the treatment antibiotic of prosthetic joint infections is only based on experts ' opinion ; this one varies from 6 weeks to several months according to the customs of the influencer . The principal aim of this study is to explore the efficacy and safety of 6 weeks versus 12 weeks antibiotic therapy duration , both associated with surgical procedure ( debridement and retention of implant , one-stage or two stages exchange ) , in PJI treatment . The study concerns 410 men or women of more than 18 years include in 34 centres in France . The duration of the study is of 4 years .","Although the infection risk following primary hip and knee arthroplasties is less than 2 % , prosthetic joint infections ( PJI ) have become more frequent due to the increasing number of patients undergoing surgery . PJI remains one of the most serious complications of prosthetic joint implantation . Each PJI episode represents substantial morbidity with a 5.3-7.2-fold higher cost than for the initial arthroplasty . The management of PJI almost always necessitates the need for surgical intervention and prolonged courses of intravenous or oral antimicrobial therapy . Despite a significant amount of basic and clinical research in this field , many questions pertaining to the definition of infection as well as diagnosis and management of these infections remain unanswered . The optimal surgical and antibiotic treatment of PJI remains unclear . The infection of implant is difficult to treat . According to the Infectious Diseases Society America recommendations of Osmon et al . in 2012 , antibiotic therapy duration varies : 3 months for hip arthroplasties ( 6 months for total knee arthroplasties ) for PJI with arthroplasty retention , and 6 weeks for two-stage exchanges . Sometimes , excessive antibiotic treatment durations are performed because recommendations are not evidence-based sensu strictu and only based on experts ' opinion . Short therapy should be benefit to ecologic and economic impact . While the usual treatment is by the parenteral route for the first 2-4 weeks , this attitude is not evidence-based either . Up to one-third of patients with PJI may experience antibiotic-related or catheter-related problems during parenteral treatment . The one-stage and two-stage exchange of the infected implant has rather comparable success rate in the surgical management of the PJI ( about 90 % ) . Recent no-randomized studies indicate that short antibiotic therapy ( 6 weeks ) seems to be efficient . Our proposal study is to explore the efficacy and safety of 6 weeks in the treatment of PJI , after a surgical procedure . The principal aim of this study is to explore the efficacy and safety of 6 weeks versus 12 weeks antibiotic therapy duration , both associated with surgical procedure ( debridement and retention of implant , one-stage or two stages exchange ) , in PJI treatment .

CANDLE-KIT Trial Study Group,NCT01817699,Correcting Anemia and Native Vitamin D Supplementation in Kidney Transplant Recipients,CANDLE-KIT Trial Study Group,4,0,Kidney Transplantation,Other,High Hb target,Treatment,,The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of anemia correction and vitamin D supplementation in kidney transplant recipients .,"Sample size estimation : The previous trial ( the CAPRIT study ) showed that 2.0 g/dL increase of hemoglobin ( Hb ) reduced 69 % of 2-year decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) ( Choukroun G , et al . J Am Soc Nephrol , 2012 ) . Given that the annual eGFR decline in our patients with Hb level < 10.5 g/dL was 1.66 ( SD , 2.47 ) mL/min per 1.73 m2 , the investigators hypothesized that the 2-year eGFR decline in the conservative anemia management group and the aggressive anemia correction group should be 3.32 ( SD , 4.94 ) and 1.03 ( SD , 4.94 ) mL/min per 1.73 m2 , respectively . In order to compare the actual efficacy of the intervention with the assumptions above and to evaluate the need for an early termination of the trial , the investigators will perform one interim analysis using a Pocock type α-spending function when a total of 50-60 % of the target sample size completed this study or dropped out . Assuming 20 % of dropout or lost-to-follow , the planned sample size of 272 patients would yield a power of 90 % for group comparison by using t-test with a type I error of 5 % . Regarding cholecalciferol supplementation , 1,000 IU/day would increase serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level by 11.8 ng/mL in patients with BMI < 30 , as suggested by the previous trial ( Gallagher JC , et al . Ann Intern Med , 2012 ) . The investigators found in our prospective cohort study that the 98.2 % of Japanese kidney transplant recipients had BMI < 30 , and that 10 ng/mL increase in 25-hydroxyvitamin D level was significantly associated with 0.75 mL/min/1.73 m2 less decrease in annual eGFR change independent of potential confounders ( in submission ) . As with the anemia intervention arms above , the investigators will perform one interim analysis using a Pocock type α-spending function when a total of 50-60 % of the target sample size completed this study or dropped out in order to compare the actual efficacy of the intervention with the assumptions above and to evaluate the need for an early termination of the trial . Therefore , the investigators expect 1.77 mL/min per 1.73 m2 in eGFR would be preserved by 1,000 IU/day of cholecalciferol supplementation for 2 years . Based on this assumption , this study size will provide a power of 70 % . Estimating kidney function : In primary analyses , eGFR will be calculated by using the Japanese equation as in sample size calculation ( Matsuo S , et al . Am J Kidney Dis , 2009 ) . However , this formula has not yet been validated in kidney transplant recipients . Therefore , the investigators will use the creatinine-based CKD-EPI equation with Japanese coefficient ( Stevens LA , et al . Nephrol Dial Transplant , 2010 . Horio M , et al . Am J Kidney Dis , 2010 ) and an available formula if validated in Japanese kidney transplant recipients at the time of analysis . Statistical analyses : For group comparison in a primary analysis , the investigators will use t-test or Wilcoxon rank sum test according to the distribution of eGFR change . In the further analyses , to analyze the time course of eGFR with respect to treatment assignment , changes in eGFR over time will be analyzed with a linear mixed model for repeated measures with both fixed and random intercept and slope . The multivariate model will contain time-varying eGFR as dependent variable and treatment group as well as the number of measurements ( time ) as independent variables . The study hypothesis will be tested by adding appropriate interaction terms between the exposures and time . For secondary endpoints , the investigators will use t-test , Wilcoxon rank sum test , or log-rank test for group comparison , and generalized linear models or Cox proportional hazards models to estimate each effect of the interventions , appropriately . The investigators will also adjust for baseline levels or past history of each outcome . Other potential confounders , such as age , sex , time since transplantation , blood pressure , urinary protein level , and diabetes , will be adjusted in sensitivity analyses . The interaction will be checked between anemia management and cholecalciferol supplementation as well as between each intervention and baseline levels of urinary protein , eGFR , Hb , 25-hydroxyvitamin D , the use of active vitamin D compounds , and the length of time since transplantation . Additionally , stratified analyses will be conducted according to 0.2 g/g･creatinine of urinary protein and the date of transplantation ( November 1999 , the release date of mycophenolate mofetil in Japan ) . However , the study size is not large enough to statistically evaluate these interactions . The results from these analyses should be interpreted with caution and regarded as exploratory and hypothesis generating . Missing values : Missing values will not be imputed in primary analyses . In sensitivity analyses , the investigators will use multiple imputation method and last-observation-carried-forward method .

However , a limited number of studies has been published to date including patients with poor ovarian response according to the `` Bologna criteria '' , whereas no randomized trial is published or ongoing for this population . Preliminary reports in `` Bologna poor responders '' highlight the limited prospects for these women . Natural cycle IVF has been shown to result in disappointingly low live birth rates , regardless of patients ' age and ovarian stimulation with widely accepted treatment modalities , e.g . short agonist protocol , did not appear demonstrate substantial benefits .

These cells are called Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes , or TIL and we have given this type of treatment to over 200 patients with melanoma . This study will use chemotherapy to prepare the immune system before this white blood cell treatment . After receiving the cells , the drug aldesleukin ( IL-2 ) may be given to help the cells stay alive longer . Objectives : - To see if chemotherapy and white blood cell therapy is a safe and effective treatment for advanced ocular melanoma . Eligibility : - Individuals at least greater than or equal to 16 years to less than or equal to 75 years who have advanced ocular melanoma . Design : Work up stage : Patients will be seen as an outpatient at the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) clinical Center and undergo a history and physical examination , scans , x-rays , lab tests , and other tests as needed . Surgery : If the patients meet all of the requirements for the study they will undergo surgery to remove a tumor that can be used to grow the TIL product . Leukapheresis : Patients may undergo leukapheresis to obtain additional white blood cells . { Leukapheresis is a common procedure , which removes only the white blood cells from the patient . } Treatment : Once their cells have grown , the patients will be admitted to the hospital for the conditioning chemotherapy , the TIL cells and aldesleukin . They will stay in the hospital for about 4 weeks for the treatment . Follow up : Patients will return to the clinic for a physical exam , review of side effects , lab tests , and scans about every 1-3 months for the first year , and then every 6 months to 1 year as long as their tumors are shrinking . Follow up visits take up to 2 days .","Background : Metastatic ocular melanoma ( OM ) carries a poor prognosis with estimated survival of 4-6 months . There are no known effective systemic therapies . Metastatic OM is classified as an orphan disease and there are currently few clinical trial options for these patients . Thus , novel systemic approaches are desperately needed . Administration of autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes ( TIL ) generated from resected metastatic cutaneous melanoma can induce objective long-term tumor responses . Minimally invasive , safe , and effective surgical approaches have been developed in the Surgery Branch to procure liver tumor tissue for TIL generation . Objectives : To determine whether autologous Young TIL infused with or without the administration of high-dose aldesleukin may result in clinical tumor regression in patients with metastatic ocular melanoma receiving a non-myeloablative lymphoid depleting preparative regimen . To study immunologic correlates associated with Young TIL therapy for ocular melanoma . To determine the toxicity of this treatment regimen . Eligibility : Patients with metastatic ocular melanoma who are greater than or equal to 16 years of age , and are physically able to tolerate non-myeloablative chemotherapy . Patients who can tolerate high-dose aldesleukin will receive it following cell infusion ; those who can not tolerate high-dose aldesleukin due to medical comorbidities or refuse high dose aldesleukin will receive cell infusion without aldesleukin . There is no requirement for prior systemic therapies , given the lack of known effective systemic treatments for metastatic OM . Design : Patients will undergo biopsy or resection to obtain tumor for generation of autologous TIL cultures and autologous cancer cell lines . All patients will receive a non-myeloablative lymphocyte depleting preparative regimen of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine . On day 0 patients will receive between 1x10^9 to 2x10^11 young TIL and then begin high dose aldesleukin ( 720,000 IU/kg intravenous ( IV ) every 8 hours for up to 15 doses ) or no aldesleukin if they are not medically eligible to receive it . A complete evaluation of evaluable lesions will be conducted 4-6 weeks after the last dose of aldesleukin in the aldesleukin arm and 4-6 weeks after the cell administration in the no aldesleukin arm . Patients will be enrolled into two cohorts . The cohort receiving high-dose aldesleukin ( cohort A ) will be conducted using a small optimal two-stage Phase II design , initially 19 patients will be enrolled , and if 4 or more of the first 19 patients have a clinical response ( partial response ( PR ) or complete response ( CR ) , accrual will continue to 33 patients , targeting a 35 % goal for objective response . For the cohort that will not receive aldesleukin ( cohort B ) , the study will be conducted as a Minimax two-stage phase II trial . Initially 12 evaluable patients will be enrolled to this cohort , and if 1 or more the first 12 have a response , then accrual would continue until a total of 21 patients , targeting a 20 % goal for objective response .",2013-03-15,"September 10, 2018","INCLUSION CRITERIA : Measurable metastatic ocular melanoma .

Intratumoral injection or intramural ( into the resected tumor cavity ) of DNX2401 into brain tissue will be followed by up to two 28 - day cycles of oral temozolomide ( TMZ ) in schedule of 7 days on/7 days off to evaluate safety of the combination . Completion of two full cycles of TMZ will be dependent upon tolerance and toxicity . The rationale in using the virus with chemotherapy begins with the lessons learned in many clinical trials in glioblastoma ( GBM ) about both the great difficulty of treating this disease with monotherapy and the limitations of the therapeutic virus . The best clinical results in recent years have been achieved with combinations of multiple therapeutics efforts , including , maximum resection and chemotherapy , immunotherapy and targeted therapies . There are very strong preclinical data about the synergy of DNX-2401 and TMZ proposed in our trial design . The dose-dense schemes of TMZ like the one we will use , have been developed with the aim to saturate o6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase ( MGMT ) . The published results to date have shown reasonable toxicity albeit with modest efficacy ' these schemes are now in phase III trials . In addition , autophagy triggered by TMZ could help viral replication in the tumor cells 11 . The last argument in favor of this virus + TMZ combination is the proved efficacy in killing GBM tumor stem cells . In vitro and animals models have shown this combination is much more effective that any of the treatments alone against GBM stem cells and the tumors derived from them .",DNX2401 will be injected after stereotactic biopsy reveals intraoperative pathology confirming the presence of recurrent glioblastoma .

Duke University,NCT01954160,Study of Renal Denervation in Patients With Heart Failure,Adrian Hernandez,2,0,Heart Failure,Device,Symplicity Renal Denervation,Treatment,,"Congestive heart failure is a common disorder in which the heart can not pump enough blood to meet the needs of the rest of the body . Poor sodium handling by the kidneys is a damaging effect of heart failure , and it leads to symptoms of congestion such as shortness of breath or ankle swelling . Recent studies suggest that reducing the nerve activity to a kidney could reduce sodium retention and blood pressure . An improvement in the way the kidneys handle sodium may reduce disease progression and decrease symptoms for heart failure patients .","Over the past decades , clinical trials in HF have been unable to alter the natural history of cardio-renal compromise . Fluid retention accounts for the majority of admissions for acute decompensated heart failure , and salt and water removal using intravenous ( IV ) diuretics has been the mainstay of therapy applied to this population.1 Over 20 % of hospitalized patients in the Acute Decompensated Heart Failure National Registry ( ADHERE ) had serum creatinine values greater than 2.0 mg/dL2 with the majority of congested patients presenting with significantly elevated systolic blood pressures rather than low-output states.1 Administration of IV loop diuretics further produces intravascular volume depletion and reduction in glomerular filtration rates3 as well as an increase in neurohormonal activation.4 This is true regardless of whether LVEF is impaired or preserved.5 However , despite relieving symptoms , acute drug administrations ( such as adenosine receptor antagonists or natriuretic peptide analogues ) for short durations have not changed the long-term cardio-renal outcomes in large clinical trials . Recent recognition of different phenotypes of cardio-renal syndrome has provided better characterization of patient populations to evaluate specific treatment approaches or interventions.6 There is now greater appreciation that patients with congestive HF depend not only on an adequate glomerular function for renal glomerular filtration , but also on adequate tubular function for effective sodium handling that may or may not be dependent on glomerular filtration.7 Despite optimizing intracardiac filling pressures , many patients with August 28 , 2013 Page 10 of 58 cardio-renal compromise remain symptomatic , complaining of breathlessness and fatigue often associated with concomitant increase in neurohormonal up-regulation ( e.g . natriuretic peptides ) and poor outcomes.8 Since the majority of patients present with hypertension , it points to the possibility that congestive HF is precipitated by heightened sympathetic drive . Animal models have demonstrated that both blood pressure control and renal tubular function/glomerular filtration ( as a function of renal blood flow ) can be directly influenced by renal sympathetic nerve activity,9-12 which has evolved to provide cardiovascular support in the setting of hypovolemia or profound cardiovascular collapse . Specifically , HF animal models with denervated kidneys have demonstrated improvement in renal blood flow and natriuresis ( with restoration of Na+-K+ ATPase at the loop of Henle , as well as epithelial sodium pumps at the distal tubules ) . However , our understanding of how persistently activated renal sympathetic outflow can lead to exaggerated neurohormonal up-regulation and chemoreceptor regulation in humans is still evolving . As heightened cardio-renal compromise leads to disease progression and congestive HF , it is conceivable that an approach to selectively modulate renal sympathetic outflow may improve cardio-renal compromise as well as the target mechanism leading to symptomatic improvement in at-risk patients . By establishing the mechanistic role of renal sympathetic outflow in patients with impaired sodium handling as a contributor to congestion in HF , we may better understand why patients with HF develop symptoms , retain salt and water , and activate neurohormonal systems . This trial will be hypothesis generating and will serve to inform a larger clinical trial in patients with congestion related to HF . The Data Safety and Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) , an independent committee assigned by the sponsor to oversee the conduct and safety of this study , met on May 12 , 2014 to review information that had become available from another study of the renal artery denervation procedure using the same investigational catheter as the PRESERVE study . Even though there were no concerns for the safety of subjects that had the renal artery denervation , the DSMB decided to stop the PRESERVE study . Based upon agreement with the FDA , the protocol was amended to reduce subject participation from 52 weeks to 13 weeks and to only collect limited safety information .",2013-09-24,"December 30, 2015","Inclusion Criteria : Male or female , aged 21-80 years old .

It is well known that autoimmune diseases such as IBD , asthma , diabetes , and multiple sclerosis are more common in industrialized , well-developed countries with better sanitation and hygiene , as in the United States . These `` cleaner '' environments reduce exposure to germs and parasites naturally found in the environment . This reduced exposure may trigger responses in the body that make people more prone to diseases such as UC .

People can get malaria if an infected mosquito bites them . Malaria destroys red blood cells . Most malaria is mild , but some children develop severe malaria , which kills about 660,000 people annually . About 9 in 10 who die of malaria are Sub-Saharan African children , most under 5 years old . Scientists can save many lives if they find out how to prevent or relieve severe malaria . Objective : - To know if a common medicine called activated charcoal can reduce severe malaria symptoms . Eligibility : - Children 2 to 11 years old with mild malaria who live in Kenieroba , Mali . Design : For the first 2 days and nights , participants will stay in the hospital . They will have their medical history taken , and a physical exam . Blood will be drawn from a thin tube inserted in their hand or forearm . This will be done 3 times overall . A drop of blood will be taken from a finger prick 12 times overall . An antimalarial drug will be injected into the tube in the arm 4 times . Each time the drug is given , participants will drink a small cup of either water or activated charcoal . For the following 3 days , participants will take an antimalarial pill . On day 7 , participants will visit the hospital . A drop of blood from a finger prick will be tested for malaria parasites .","While the incidence of Plasmodium falciparum malaria declines ( 1 ) the proportion of cases with severe malaria ( SM ) may increase ( 2 ) . The mortality associated with SM in endemic countries remains high despite the use of artesunate ( AS ) ( 3 ) . Safe , cheap , and effective adjunct therapies preventing the development of , or reducing the mortality from , SM could have considerable and rapid public health impact . We discovered that oral administration of activated charcoal ( oAC ) , a safe treatment for acute poisoning ( 4 ) , protects mice from experimental cerebral malaria and demonstrated in a randomized controlled trial ( RCT ) in African adults that oAC is safe and does not interfere with the pharmacokinetics of AS ( 5 ) . Here , we propose the next step to evaluate the efficacy of adjunct treatment with oAC in Malian children and to explore its mode of action . Before testing adjunct treatment with oAC in children with SM , we will perform an open-label RCT in children with uncomplicated malaria ( UM ) to demonstrate non-inferiority of intravenous ( IV ) AS plus adjunct oAC vs. IV AS alone with regards to parasite clearance rate . This study will be conducted in African children , because they are the primary target population for such an intervention . Although the adequate standard-of-care treatment for UM is oral ( PO ) administration of an artemisinin-based combination therapy ( ACT ) , we will treat participants with IV AS . Like ACT treatment of UM , AS is the WHO-recommended first-line treatment for SM ( 1 ) . In order for the data obtained from UM cases to be meaningful for our future studies in children with SM , we will administer AS to the UM cases in this trial via the same IV route that is used to administer AS to SM cases . Exploratory objectives include : ( i ) to compare the kinetics of plasma cytokines in both groups , and ( ii ) to preserve RNA for gene transcription analysis for future studies into the mode of action of oAC . The study will be nested within an NIAID-funded study ( Principal Investigators Drs . Fairhurst , Diakite ) that assesses parasite clearance rates in response to AS treatment in Kenieroba ( 6 ) . Children aged 2-10 years with UM and initial parasite densities 10,000 70,000 parasites per micro L will be enrolled . Parasite clearance rates will be expressed as the parasite half-life ( Ph ) , estimated from parasite clearance curves using a formula that has been validated in this cohort ( 7 ) . Children will be randomized 1:1 to receive IV AS+oAC or IV AS only , respectively , until complete specimen and data sets for 35 children per group are obtained . oAC will be administered as Actidose Aqua [ registered ] at 0 , 6 , 12 , and 18 hours . AS will be administered IV following WHO recommendations for use of AS in SM ( 8 ) , followed by 3 daily doses of amodiaquine ( AQ ) . Subsequently and in a separate study , we plan a proof-of-concept RCT to determine whether adjunct oAC reduces disease severity and morbidity ( assessed by scoring systems ( 9 ) ) in hospitalized children with SM and to define the mode of action of oAC . Since oAC is a licensed , inexpensive drug without sophisticated storage requirements , which has an extremely long shelf life at room temperature and can be given orally or via nasogastric tube at high doses without major side effects ( 4 , 10 ) , this drug has an ideal profile for use at the primary health-care level to reduce mortality from SM , or even prevent the development of SM .",2013-09-28,"January 8, 2018","INCLUSION CRITERIA Age 2 to 10 years , inclusive Resident of Kenieroba Uncomplicated malaria * P. falciparum density 10,000 70,000/micro L , inclusive Willingness to participate in the study as evidenced by informed consent of the child s parent or guardian Ability to swallow oral medication Uncomplicated malaria : axillary temperature > 37.5oC or history of fever in the past few days and no criteria of SM ( see next paragraph ) and no other etiologies of febrile illness ( e.g. , respiratory tract infection ) on clinical examination .

Most commonly , certain medications called opioids , such as morphine , are given through the vein or into the muscle . However , a more effective way to give pain relief with fewer side effects ( such as nausea and slowing your breathing ) is to give opioids in the spinal space as part of the medications given for a cesarean delivery . For many years , the opioid of choice was morphine due to its long anesthetic effect and acceptable side effect profile . A nation-wide disruption in the supply of preservative-free morphine has made it necessary to look for alternatives . Many institutions worldwide have used another opioid , called hydromorphone , in the spinal space for over a decade . This drug has a very good safety and side effect profile and has been used at the investigators ' institution for more than a year . Of interest , while a number of different doses of hydromorphone have been used , there have been very few studies to evaluate the best dose for providing good pain relief with minimal side effects . The goal of this study is to find the best dose of spinal hydromorphone for women undergoing cesarean delivery .","Intrathecal opioids in have been shown to produce analgesia . Lipid solubility and effect on specific mu opioid receptors in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord primarily determine the analgesic effect of intrathecally injected opioids . Rostral spread of intrathecal opioids causes some of the side effects like pruritus , respiratory depression , nausea and vomiting . In the investigators ' institute , during cesarean delivery under spinal anesthesia is usually performed with 1.6-1.8 ml of 0.75 % bupivacaine with dextrose ( hyperbaric solution ) with 10-20mcg of fentanyl . Preservative free intrathecal ( IT ) morphine100 to 200 mcg is injected at the time of initiation of spinal block for postoperative pain relief . Multiple studies have shown excellent postoperative pain relief following cesarean delivery up to 18hrs with this dosing regimen . However , there has been a national shortage of preservative free morphine since August 2012 . Based on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile , intrathecal ( IT ) preservative free hydromorphone 100 mcg has been used as a substitute . Anecdotal experience during the past 8 months suggest that patients have comparable post partum pain relief , with a similar side-effect profile to IT morphine . There is no published data on the optimal dose of IT hydromorphone for post cesarean analgesia . There are case reports and retrospective case study of use of 100mcg IT hydromorphone . One randomized controlled trial for knee arthroscopy used 2.5-5-10 mcg of IT hydromorphone for postoperative analgesia . Hence it is important to determine the optimal dose of IT hydromorphone for post operative pain management following cesarean delivery in terms of analgesic efficacy , incidence of side effects and the need for treatment interventions This study will aim to determine the optimal dose of intrathecal hydromorphone that would provide adequate postoperative analgesia with minimal side effects .",2013-09-12,"May 22, 2017","Inclusion Criteria : Healthy at-term parturients undergoing elective cesarean delivery under spinal anesthesia Exclusion Criteria : Emergency cesarean delivery Respiratory disease significant comorbidities : preeclampsia , insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus obstructive sleep apnea body mass index > 35kg/m2 < 18yrs documented intolerance or allergy to systemic or neuraxial opioids patient with a history of chronic opioid or current use of opioids",29,1,18 Years,40 Years

Before NK-infusion , patients received immunosuppressive chemotherapy .","NK cell-mediated cytotoxity is regulated by signals provided by surface inhibitory and activating receptors . Target cells will be killed in the absence of interaction between NK inhibitory receptors and their ligands ( HLA class I molecules ) on the target cells . The proposed phase I/II study plans to realize an adoptive anti-leukaemic immunotherapy by infusion of haploidentical HLA-I mismatched NK cells to treat poor prognosis AML patients . Familial donors of NK cells will be selected according to their HLA typing in order to choose a donor with NK cells expressing at least one inhibitory receptor that can not recognize any HLA class I molecule on recipient cells . NK cells will be selected from donor peripheral mononuclear cells by a two step purification protocol ( CD3 negative with subsequent CD56 positive selections ) . NK cells will be then activated ex vivo overnight in the presence of IL-2 before infusion . In vivo IL-2 injections will be performed for 14 days . Before NK-infusion , patients will be conditioned by a cytoreductive and immunosuppressive chemotherapy . An extensive biological study of NK cells will be performed in the recipient post-infusion , including chimerism analyses , phenotypic and functional tests in order to evaluate NK-cell expansion post-infusion and their capacity to mediate an antitumoral effect . Since donor NK cells have been selected for their potential graft versus host ( GvH ) and graft versus leukemia ( GvL ) reactivity , such approach might induce prolonged cytopenia due to a direct toxicity of NK cells against normal hematopoietic progenitors . The main goals of this study will be thus to evaluate ( 1 ) the hematological feasibility of allogeneic NK-cell infusion , ( 2 ) the expansion of the infused population , ( 3 ) an antitumoral effect mediated by this adoptive immunotherapy .

Tufts Medical Center,NCT01941745,Efficacy of Recombinant Human Clara Cell 10 Protein (rhCC10) Administered to Premature Neonates With Respiratory Distress Syndrome,Tufts Medical Center,2,1,Respiratory Distress Syndrome in Premature Infant,Drug,Half normal saline,Treatment,Triple,"Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia ( BPD ) is a multi-factorial disease process that is the end result of an immature , surfactant deficient lung that has been exposed to hyperoxia , mechanical ventilation and infection . These conditions initiate an inflammatory response characterized by elevated inflammatory cell infiltrates and proinflammatory cytokines that lead to the development of significant acute and chronic lung injury . The study drug , rhCC10 , is a recombinant version of natural human CC10 protein . Native CC10 is produced primarily by non-ciliated respiratory epithelial cells , called Clara cells and is the most abundant protein in the mucosal fluids in normal healthy lungs . The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics , safety , tolerability and anti-inflammatory effects of a single intratracheal ( IT ) dose of rhCC10 to intubated premature infants receiving positive pressure ventilation for treatment of respiratory distress syndrome ( RDS ) to prevent long term respiratory complications referred to as bronchopulmonary dysplasia , and , more recently , as Chronic Pulmonary Insufficiency of Prematurity ( CPIP ; asthma , cough , wheezing , multiple respiratory infections ) . CC10 regulates inflammatory responses and protects the structural integrity of pulmonary tissue while preserving pulmonary mechanical function during various insults ( eg . viral infection , bacterial endotoxin , ozone , allergens , hyperoxia ) . Together these properties suggest that administration of rhCC10 may help to facilitate development of normal airway epithelia and prevent the inflammation that leads to CPIP in these infants . This study is funded by the FDA Office of Orphan Product Development ( OOPD ) .","Recombinant human CC10 protein ( rhCC10 ) is a novel therapeutic agent used to prevent the development of chronic respiratory morbidity ( CPIP ; repeated respiratory infections , asthma , re-hospitalizations ) in preterm infants . Native CC10 is a natural anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory factor produced by Clara Cells in the lung and is the most abundant protein in respiratory mucosa . Animal data demonstrate that a single intratracheal dose of rhCC10 administered shortly after birth reduces lung inflammation ( important biomarkers linked to lung injury in preterm infants ) , promotes normal lung development , preserves lung architecture , improves pulmonary function , suppresses the response to endotoxin and enhances resistance to pulmonary infections . In preterm infants who die or develop lung inflammation and subsequent bronchopulmonary dysplasia ( BPD ) , both the concentration and activity of CC10 are significantly reduced indicating that CC10 is essential for preventing lung injury and promoting normal lung development . In a small phase I study , rhCC10 significantly decreased several indices of pulmonary inflammation in the lungs of premature infants who were at risk of developing BPD and associated CPIP . The drug appeared to be safe , well-tolerated , and reduce risk of re-hospitalization due to respiratory illness for 9-10 months after a single intratracheal dose at the time of birth ( 0/11 rhCC10-treated infants vs. 3/6 placebo-treated ) . This supports the protective role of rhCC10 against damage from hyperoxia , mechanical ventilation , inflammation , and infection in the immature lung . A more normal airway epithelium will produce significantly more endogenous CC10 , with both factors contributing to enhanced resistance to infections , less asthma , and improved long-term respiratory outcome . We propose to conduct a Phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate rhCC10 in extremely premature infants ( < 29 weeks gestation ) for the prevention of BPD and CPIP . This will be a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled dose escalation study in 88 premature infants . A single intratracheal dose of study drug ( rhCC10 or placebo ) will be administered to preterm infants receiving surfactant and mechanical ventilation for treatment of RDS . Infants will be followed to evaluate safety , pharmacokinetics , and short and long term efficacy of this approach . Safety will be evaluated through serious adverse event ( SAE ) and adverse event monitoring and by Bayley neurodevelopmental assessments at 18 months corrected gestational age ( CGA ) . Efficacy measurements will include the primary combined endpoint of alive without evidence of CPIP through 12 months CGA ( defined by parental diaries and pulmonary questionnaires ) comparing rhCC10 treated to placebo controls . The availability of a therapy which prevents lung injury , promotes lung development , and prevents serious respiratory infections and asthma in high risk preterm infants would be a highly significant advancement in care .",2013-08-29,"August 22, 2019","Inclusion Criteria : Age less than or equal to 24 hours ; Birth weight 600 - 1250 grams ; Gestational age 24-29 weeks ( not less than 24 weeks ) ; at birth based on best estimate using obstetrical sonography ( first or second trimester ) , solid dating criteria , or Ballard examination ; Birth weight appropriate for gestational age ; 5 minute Apgar score > 5 ; Diagnosis of neonatal RDS based on clinical and radiographic criteria ; Requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation for treatment of RDS ; Received at least one dose of surfactant ( prophylaxis or rescue ) ; and Written informed consent is obtained from at least one of the infant 's parents or legal guardians ( see section 6.2 ) prior to enrollment of the subject .

The study is designed to assess whether the antidepressant response to treatment with intravenous ( IV ) ketamine can be maintained by treatment with minocycline in patients with MDD and Bipolar Depression Type II ( compared to placebo ) . Both hospitalized patients as well as patients being treated as an outpatient for their current episode of depression can qualify for participation in this study . The study has four sequential phases : if eligibility for the study has been confirmed during the 21-day screening phase , the patients will enter a 12-day open-label ( ie , patient and physician know the intervention that is being administered ) treatment phase during which the patient will receive 6 open-label IV infusions of 0.5 mg/kg ketamine on Day 1 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 10 and 12 in combination with open-label minocycline , orally administered twice daily . All patients will remain at the study site for at least 4 hours after the IV ketamine administrations . Response to treatment will be assessed using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) which is designed to measure the overall severity of depressive symptoms . Patients responding to ketamine/minocycline treatment will be randomized to receive minocycline or placebo for 6 weeks during a 6-week blinded treatment phase or until relapse . A patient will be defined as a `` ketamine responder '' if there is a 50 % or more decrease in comparison to baseline values ( Day 1 predose ) in the MADRS total score performed at 3 to 4 hours postdose on Days 8 , 10 , or 12 , with a 40 % or more decrease from baseline in the MADRS total score on Day 12 . Patients not responding to treatment with ketamine/minocycline will be given the option to receive 100 mg minocycline twice daily as open-label treatment for a maximum of 6 weeks .

University of New Mexico,NCT01804777,Epithelial Sodium Channel (ENaC) as a Novel Mechanism for Hypertension and Volume Expansion in Type 2 Diabetes,University of New Mexico,0,0,Proteinuria,Drug,Amiloride,Health Services Research,Double,"The purpose of this study is to determine with the administration of amiloride , observe an enhanced natriuresis , reduction in blood pressure and weight compared to the administration of hydrochlorothiazide in Type 2 Diabetics .","Renal sodium retention and extracellular fluid volume expansion are hallmarks of nephrotic syndrome . There is abundant evidence that this occurs even in the absence of activation of hormones that are known to activate renal Na transporters . Proteinuria not only reflects glomerular damage , but also functions as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease , stroke , end stage renal disease and is associated with extracellular volume expansion and high BP . In the natural course of Type II diabetes , microalbuminuria and elevations in blood pressure are thought to occur at around the same time . Blood pressure in microalbuminuric diabetics is more sensitive to dietary salt intake than in normoalbuminuric patients despite both groups having similar aldosterone and plasma renin activity levels . Proteolytic processing of ENaC subunits might provide the primary defect in renal sodium handling in these microalbuminuric individuals . However , proteinuria is not consistently identified as a risk factor for incipient elevation in blood pressure and in some studies elevated blood pressure predicts the advent of microalbuminuria . Analyses of normotensive normoalbuminuric subjects in previous studies have found that higher urinary albumin levels in the normal range predicted incident hypertension . A similar finding was seen in a non-diabetic cohort . These studies suggest that these disparate results may be related to the cut off that defined microalbuminuria . Another possible explanation is that an ENaC activator , like plasmin , contributes to the generation of incident hypertension in some individuals . Levels of albuminuria may not necessarily be reflective of ENaC activator levels and may vary from individual to individual . Perhaps urinary plasmin and plasminogen provides a more robust biomarker for those individuals who may develop hypertension . Recent evidence suggests that in some individuals with glomerular damage , proteases not normally found in urine enter the urinary space and aberrantly cleave ENaC . In this setting , filtered plasminogen ( inactive precursor ) is converted to plasmin ( active protease ) by urokinase that is expressed in tubular epithelial lumen . The proteolytic activation of ENaC would generate a primary defect in renal sodium handling , a mechanism that may be a particularly important factor leading to increases in extracellular fluid volume and BP that accompany nephrotic syndrome . While previous studies have examined the role of amiloride in low-renin hypertension , and as an additional agent the conventional treatment of hypertension , no human trials have tested whether ENaC inhibitors impact blood pressure and volume status in the setting of proteinuria . Over a ten year period , millions of diabetics , 5.3 % of Type II diabetics and 28 % of Type I diabetics develop macroscopic proteinuria .",2013-03-01,"May 9, 2018","Inclusion Criteria : Age 18 to 80 yrs at randomization History of Type 2 Diabetes Presence of systolic hypertension or pre-hypertension ( average systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) ≥120 mmHg and 300 mg/g creatinine at screening Hemoglobin A1C < 8 % Willing and able to give informed consent Exclusion Criteria : Average SBP of ≥180 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ( DBP ) of ≥110 mmHg Current symptomatic heart failure , history of New York Heart Association Class III or IV congestive heart failure , or left ventricular ( LV ) ejection fraction ( by any method ) < 25 % ; these patients may be harmed with withdrawal of diuretics Serum potassium level 5.0 at screening History of hyperkalemia in the last two years ( serum K > 5.5 ) Contraindication to use of hydrochlorothiazide or amiloride Unstable angina pectoris or acute myocardial infarction ( MI ) in last 3 months Known secondary causes of hypertension ( HTN ) ( screening for these conditions will not be required ) Estimated glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) < 60 mL/min/1.73m² , as determined by validated estimating equations On or expected to be on immunosuppressive therapy Any history of solid organ transplantation Significant dementia Other factors likely to limit adherence during trial ( eg . alcohol or substance abuse , plan to move in next year , history of non-adherence to medications , appointments and medical care , reluctance of close family members to participate in trial , lack of support from primary healthcare provider ) Participation in another investigational trial within 4 weeks of the screening visit Arm Circumference too large or too small to allow accurate blood pressure measurement Pregnancy or currently trying to become pregnant ( although this is unlikely because of age limit Incarceration",9,0,18 Years,80 Years

"Insel Gruppe AG, University Hospital Bern",NCT01803763,Prospective Double-blind Placebo-controlled Study of the Effect of Xolair (Omalizumab) in Chronic Urticaria Patients,"Insel Gruppe AG, University Hospital Bern",2,1,Chronic Urticaria,Drug,Omalizumab (Xolair),Basic Science,Quadruple,"The aim of this study is to investigate the pathophysiological mechanism of omalizumab in patients with documented chronic urticaria who have complaints under standard antihistamine treatment . With this study the investigators will assess the correlation between Fc-IgE receptor downregulation as well as functionality and clinical response to omalizumab treatment in patients with chronic urticaria . This may be an approach for other diseases as well , where Fc-IgE receptor crosslinking are essential . The treatment time is set for a total of 4 monthly applications of omalizumab . According to the dosage recommendations of recent studies , fixed doses of 300 mg omalizumab are administered subcutaneously .","Background Chronic urticaria ( CU ) is a frequent disease with a lifetime incidence of up to 25-30 % of the population . Currently , CU treatment relies mainly on second generation antihistamines and is purely symptomatic . The disease tends to have a cyclical nature with spontaneous disappearance and frequent relapses . Some patients show a sufficient response to standard second generation antihistamines like ( levo ) cetirizine 10mg , ( des ) loratadine 5mg or terfenadine 120-180mg . Others need higher doses ( up to 4-fold usual daily dose ) , often accompanied by sedation . Treatment may last for months , even years . If this first-line therapy is insufficient , the next step ( sometimes even before use of excessively high doses of antihistamines ) is to add first generation , even more sedating antihistamines , some of which have additional modes of action ( e.g . anticholinergic effects in doxepin treatment ) . A considerable number of patients with CU need treatment escalations with leukotriene receptor blocking agents ( e.g . montelukast ) , systemic corticosteroids ( 5-20mg prednisolon/d ) or even cyclosporine ( daily dose 3-5 mg/kg ) or other immunosuppressive drugs used off-label . Such patients are often investigated more in detail to find an infection or autoimmune disease - often still without clear results . Different clinical findings suggest that the mast cell system in many patients with CU is `` overactive '' with increased releasability . Minor stress like scratching can already induce degranulation resulting in wheal-and-flare skin reactions . Therefore , a therapy directly aiming at a decrease in this mast cell `` hyperreleasability '' would be optimal . Omalizumab binds selectively to free IgE in plasma , inhibits its binding to Fc-IgE receptor on the surface of mast cells and basophils and reduces the number of Fc-IgE receptors on basophils in atopic patients . Significant reduction of Fc-IgE receptor density on the surface of circulating basophils has been found as early as 1 week after administration of omalizumab . In contrast to this , the onset of clinical efficacy of omalizumab in asthma is considered to take place relatively late , namely about 4 months after start of treatment . The pathophysiologic concepts of omalizumab treatment in allergic asthma are focused on the neutralisation of IgE , and less on the Fc-IgE receptor density . In allergology , free IgE in plasma is only relevant regarding Fc-IgE receptor density on effector cells . Therefore , Fc-IgE receptor density measurement might be an important parameter for mast cell and basophil `` releasability '' and therefore a good in vitro surrogate marker for their reactivity . E.g . it is well known that only about 50 % of IgE-sensitized individuals show clinically relevant allergic symptoms . This difference between sensitization and allergy may also be due to Fc-IgE receptor density on mast cells and basophils . Flowcytometric determination of Fc-IgE receptor density on the surface of basophils and additional testing for the functional consequences of a change in this density ( ability to crosslink Fc-IgE receptors by autoantibodies and allergens ) raise the possibility to evaluate this hypothesis - using omalizumab as a drug being able to decrease Fc-IgE receptor density : Study data show that a fixed dose of 300 mg omalizumab is useful for the treatment of CU . The investigators assume that this effect is due to the decrease of Fc-IgE receptor density . Thus , the basophil Fc-IgE receptor density should be monitored quantitatively and functionally ( see below ) and correlated to clinical response . 30-40 % of patients with CU have autoantibodies against Fc-IgE receptor or IgE itself , which can be measured in vitro ( already via ELISA , flowcytometric via CD63 and CD203c upregulation on basophils ) . Decrease of Fc-IgE receptor density may decrease basophil reactivity and explain or be correlated to the clinical response in CU patients . At least three patients will be followed for reactivity to autoantibodies over the study period . Some patients with CU may also have an accompanying IgE-mediated allergy , which is most probably irrelevant for the CU , but offers the possibility of a functional test of basophil responsiveness to low concentrations of allergens - before ( with presumably high Fc-IgE receptor density ) and after omalizumab treatment ( low Fc-IgE rec . density ) . At least three patients will be followed for allergen reactivity of basophils . Objective Primary objectives - Measurement of the kinetic of Fc-IgE receptor density change on basophils from patients with chronic urticaria with omalizumab compared to placebo Secondary objectives Change of responsiveness to Fc-IgE cross-linking dependent stimuli : incubation of patient 's basophils with anti-IgE allergen induced cross-linking ( only grass pollen and birch pollen allergic patients ) comparison of serum on third party basophils Measurement of IL-3 hyperresponsiveness of basophils after Stimulation with anti-IgE and allergen Daily urticaria activity score Medication and rescue medication use German version of the Chronic Urticaria Quality of Life Questionnaire ( CU-Q2oL ) Methods This is a monocentric , double-blind , randomized placebo-controlled trial , which aims to investigate the pathophysiological mechanism of omalizumab in patients with documented chronic urticaria who have complaints under standard antihistamine treatment .

Persons with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and recent onset schizophrenic episode or recent relapse who are prescribed minocycline in addition to standard antipsychotic medication will show greater symptom reduction , as measured by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale ( PANSS ) total score .","Minocycline has excellent penetration of the blood-brain barrier . In a mechanism that seems to be distinct from its antimicrobial properties , minocycline has anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties . These properties are thought to be related to some combination of its inhibition of inducible nitric oxide synthase ( iNOS ) ; caspase 1 and 3 ; p-38 mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) ; cytochrome C release ; cyclooxygenase-2 expression ; prostaglandin E2 formation ; and microglial activation . Minocycline has also been reported to have antiviral effects against HIV and antiprotozoal effects against Toxoplasma gondii . Its use in individuals with schizophrenia has been encouraged by its effects in rodent models of this disorder . In one study , minocycline attenuated the behavioral changes following the administration of an NMDA ( N-methyl-D-aspartate ) antagonist in mice . In another study , minocycline reversed the effects of an NMDA antagonist in rats . Some preliminary data also suggest that minocycline may be useful in patients with schizophrenia . Two case report series have been published , one including two patients with schizophrenia and the other including three patients with recent-onset acute paranoid schizophrenia . An open label study of 22 patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia , using minocycline 150 mg/d for four weeks , reported an improvement in both positive and negative symptoms . Two double blind trials have been carried out . In one study , 73 patients with schizophrenia of less than five years ' duration were randomized to minocycline 200 mg or placebo for 12 months : `` all symptom measures improved significantly '' especially in the negative symptoms . In the other study , 54 `` early phase '' ( symptoms of less than five years ) patients were randomized to minocycline 200 mg/d or placebo for six months ; the authors reported a significant improvement in negative symptoms measured using Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms ( SANS ) and Clinical Global Impressions scale ( CGI ) and a significant improvement in some test of executive function . These initial findings encourage further replication . First , these studies are of comparatively small size . Second , in countries like Ethiopia where options for the treatment of schizophrenia are limited , identifying a safe alternative to clozapine is important . Related to this , most patients have limited exposure to psychotropic medications . Third , exposure to alcohol and substances is generally believed to be lower in the Ethiopian setting . Finally , given our hypothesis that infectious agents as a cause of schizophrenia may be more important in low and middle income countries ( LAMICs ) such as Ethiopia , minocycline may prove more useful . In this regard , the trial will help to explore the etiology of schizophrenia . The investigators have experience in following-up a large cohort of patients with schizophrenia and in conducting randomized controlled trials of a similar nature , which makes this proposed study feasible .",2013-03-11,"June 29, 2016","Inclusion Criteria : Age 18-64 years Primary Axis I diagnosis ( DSM-IV ) of schizophrenia , any subtype The current episode should be either a relapse episode or a first onset schizophrenia and the duration of the relapse episode and first onset schizophrenia should be under five years Indication of treatment-resistance defined by failure of at least on adequate dose of antipsychotic medication ( equivalent to chlorpromazine of 200 mg/day or more ) given for at least four weeks .

In the writings there are no experiments that would prove that the remote preconditioning protocol effects on the higher protection of the human myocardial cells , against the ischemia-reperfusion injury . 120 patients referred for coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) procedure with use of cardiopulmonary bypass are planned will be included to the research . Patients will be randomized ( 1:1 ) to one of two groups : remote preconditioning or `` placebo '' intervention . On the day of surgery , after induction of anesthesia remote preconditioning will be elicited by 3 cycles of 5min inflation ( ischemia ) and 5 min deflation ( reperfusion ) of blood pressure cuff on the right arm . In the control group the blood pressure cuff is going to be placed on the upper limb but the preconditioning protocol will not be carried out . On cannulation for CPB , right atrial appendage and myocardial biopsies of the left ventricular will be harvested .

There is going to be an ability to define does the remote preconditioning influence on the occurrence of apoptosis in the human myocardium in the in vivo conditions and does it influence on the postoperative course in patients undergoing cardiac surgery procedures . The investigators will try to study if remote preconditioning modify induction of apoptosis and its structure in response to injury . In case the effect of remote preconditioning is not measurable in ex-vivo assessment , the future attempt at implementing this phenomenon in clinical practice may be futile and should not be continued until the effect can be confirmed in controlled experimental setting .","The investigators will study : Resistance of isolated right atrial pectinate muscle trabeculae to simulated hypoxia/reperfusion in functional organ bath model Resistance of isolated right atrial pectinate muscle trabeculae to induction of apoptosis by simulated hypoxia/reperfusion Resistance of mitochondria in isolated right atrial pectinate muscle trabeculae to changes induced by simulated hypoxia/reperfusion Simultaneously we will assess : Amount of myocardial necrosis in vivo induced by period of ischemia and reperfusion during coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) as assessed by postoperative myocardial necrosis markers release profile Myocardial function in vivo after the period of ischemia and reperfusion during CABG as assessed by hemodynamic measurements ( thermodilution method ) , oxygen supply/consumption and inotropic support requirements Induction of apoptosis and status of mitochondria after the period of ischemia , and reperfusion during CABG as assessed in left ventricular myocardial biopsies The investigators will try correlate the in vitro and in vivo findings from the same patients . Methodology The study will be conducted both in vivo and ex-vivo . Patients referred for CABG for stable coronary artery disease will be recruited and randomized ( 1:1 ) by random digit generator to one of two groups : remote preconditioning or `` placebo '' intervention . Only patients in who at least 3 coronary artery bypass grafts with use of cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) are planned will be included . On the day of surgery , after induction of anesthesia and before the skin incision remote preconditioning will be elicited . The `` placebo '' group will have the pressure cuff placed on the right arm but no inflations will be performed . To obtain blinding , the inflations will occur under surgical drapes , and will be performed by the same person every time , who will be involved in random sequence generation , and remote preconditioning application , but not in the care of the patient , or other research related tasks . All consented patients will have preoperative echocardiography , electrocardiography and blood tests including fool blood count , creatinine , BUN , and liver function test performed as part of their routine preoperative care . Additionally troponin T and CK-MB levels will be assessed . Furthermore patients will have performed electrocardiography on 1st day after operation . Anesthesia will be standardized and consist of midazolam 15mg orally 1h before surgery , etomidate 0.2mg/kg , fentanyl 5g/kg and pancuronium 0.1mg/kg iv for anesthesia induction , propofol 0.5-1.0 mg/kg/h and fentanyl 4g/kg/h infusion for anesthesia maintenance . No anesthetic gases will be used . Full hemodynamic monitoring will be used with Swan-Ganz catheter ( not routine in CABG patients ) . First hemodynamic measurements and oxygen supply/consumption calculations will be performed preoperatively . Functional in vitro assessment . On cannulation for CPB , right atrial appendage , which is routinely removed and discarded for venous cannula placement will be harvested in all patients . The tissue will be was transferred in ice cold Krebs-Henseleit solution to the isolated organ laboratory in our department . One pectinate muscle trabecula will be harvested for baseline assessment of apoptosis or mitochondria ( see below ) . Another single trabecula less than 1mm in diameter will be mounted in the organ chamber - Schuler Organbath ( Hugo Sachs Elektronik , March-Hugstetten , Germany ( HSE ) ) containing Krebs-Henseleit solution . It will be oxygenated via glass frit with carbogen ( 95 % oxygen , 5 % carbon dioxide ) and maintained at 37°C . The trabecula will be driven with 1Hz 50ms square stimuli using platinum field electrodes and the potential of 150 % of the threshold for given preparation . The stimulator Type 215 ( HSE ) will be used . The contraction force will be measured with F30 isometric force transducer Type 372 ( HSE ) . The signal will be enhanced with TAM A PlagSYS transducer amplifier module Type705 ( HSE ) and recorded using PowerLab/4SP system and Chart software ( AD Instruments ) . The trabecula will be gradually stretched to 90 % of optimal tension according to Frank-Starling relationship and left for 30min of stabilization and washout . 60min ischemia will be simulated by substituting oxygen in carbogen with argon ( 95 % argon , 5 % carbon dioxide ) and replacing Krebs-Henseleit solution with one containing no glucose or pyruvate . On reoxygenation the carbogen will be added again and the tissue bath solution will be replaced with one used initially . The tissue will be was washed several times and left for 120min of reoxygenation period with washout every 15 min . This functional model of hypoxia reoxygenation has been used in our laboratory before [ 12-14 ] . Replacement of oxygen with argon results in the drop of tissue bath oxygen partial pressure from 475±52mmHg to 51±1.8mmHg ( p < 0.001 ) [ 37-39 ] . It is accompanied by significant and rapid decline in isometric contraction force . During reoxygenation the contraction force returns initially and next we observe slow decline of muscle inotropism which we interpret as development of reoxygenation injury . At the end , we will use 10-4 M norepinephrine ( ( - ) -Arterenol Bitartrate ) to test for stunning . The contraction force will be recorded continuously . Contractility will be expressed in percent of the initial contraction force for given preparation . The investigators will compare the maximal recovered contraction force , the contraction force after 30min and 120min of reoxygenation and the contraction force produced by adding 10-4M norepinephrine at the end of reoxygenation . The investigators will also look for the signs of ischemic contracture development defined as an increase of resting tension of the trabecula . This increase , if present , starts shortly after the onset of hypoxia and continues steadily throughout the whole hypoxia period . The investigators will compare the increase in resting tension ( in mN/mg tissue mass ) at the end of hypoxia , that is at the time of maximal contracture . All measurements , and in particular recovery of function will be compared between trabeculae from remotely preconditioned and `` placebo '' patients . Two atrial trabeculae from the same appendage , one harvested at baseline , and another subjected to functional experiment ( 60 min hypoxia + 120 min reoxygenation ) will be studied each time for : apoptosis induction - Caspase 3 and cleaved Caspase 3 , PARP and cleaved PARP expression measured with Western-Blot , or apoptosis induction - assessed with TUNEL and immunohistochemistry staining for Caspase 3 , cleaved Caspase 3 , PARP and cleaved PARP , or state of mitochondria ( electron microscopy ) As we plan to randomize 120 patients ( see below ) the material for apoptosis and mitochondria studies will be randomly taken from 60 patients ( 30:30 ) for Western Blot , 40 patients ( 20:20 ) for immunohistochemistry and TUNEL , and 20 patients ( 10:10 ) for electron microscopy . Western Blot ( 2 trabeculae , baseline and after hypoxia/reoxygenation , from 30 remotely preconditioned and 30 `` placebo '' patients ) . For Western Blot immunoassay the trabeculae will be placed in liquid nitrogen Immunohistochemistry ( 2 trabeculae , baseline and after hypoxia/reoxygenation , from 20 remotely preconditioned and 20 `` placebo '' patients ) . Expression of Caspase 3 , cleaved Caspase 3 , PARP and cleaved PARP proteins in tissue sections will be detected immunohistochemically . Trabeculae will be fixed overnight in 10 % neutral-buffered formalin ( phosphate buffer ) , subsequently passed through graded alcohol solutions , processed three times in xylene , and finally embedded in paraffin blocks . The documentation of immunohistochemical reactions will be performed with SSC-DC58AP camera ( Sony ) coupled with Nikon Eclipse E400 optical microscope . TUNEL ( terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick and labeling ) ( 2 trabeculae , baseline and after hypoxia/reoxygenation , from 20 remotely preconditioned and 20 `` placebo '' patients ) . Tissue sections will be deparaffinized in 2 changes of xylene for 5 minutes each , and hydrated with 2 changes of 100 % ethanol for 3 minutes each , and 95 % ethanol for 1 minute . The documentation of immunohistochemical reactions will be performed with SSC-DC58AP camera ( Sony ) coupled with Nikon Eclipse E400 optical microscope . Electron microscopy ( 2 trabeculae , baseline and after hypoxia/reoxygenation , from 10 remotely preconditioned and 10 `` placebo '' patients ) . Trabeculae will be placed in cacodyl buffer with 2 % glutaraldehyde . The mitochondria will be micrographed with JEOL-JEM 100CX transmission electron microscope ( JEOL Inc , Peabody , Mass ) with magnification x16000 . The electron micrographs will next be saved and mitochondria size and structure will be analyzed using Image ProPlus software ( Media Scanalytics ) . The in vivo trial The operation will be performed with the use of CPB in normothermia by experienced cardiac surgeon . Intermittent warm-blood ( 37°C ) antegrade cardioplegia ( miniplegia ) will be used for myocardial protection . As only patients requiring at least 3 coronary bypass grafts will be recruited , we expect aortic crossclamp time to last at least 30 minutes . After cross clamp removal the proximal anastomoses will be performed using side biting clamp . The patient will be weaned off CPB , hemostasis will be secured and the chest will be closed over chest tubes . Just before closing the chest 16G needle-true cut biopsy of the left ventricular myocardium will be obtained from the apex area . The investigators expect the reperfusion time from the cross-clamp removal to obtaining the biopsy to last at least 40 min . The exact ischemia ( cross-clamp ) time , and reperfusion time ( until obtaining the biopsy ) will be measured . The myocardial biopsies will be harvested and assessed in the same way as atrial trabecule . The investigators will randomly perform Western blotting in 60 ( 30:30 ) biopsies harvested on liquid nitrogen , immunohistochemistry including TUNEL in 40 ( 20:20 ) harvested on 10 % neutral buffered formalin , and electron microscopy in 20 ( 10:10 ) harvested on cacodyl buffer with 2 % glutaraldehyde . The methods of assessing Caspase3 , cleaved Caspase 3 , PARP , cleaved PARP , TUNEL and mitochondria have been described above . After the operation patient will be transferred to ICU and treated as per routine . The primary endpoint of clinical observation will be the postoperative release of cardiac troponin T. The investigators will measure serum concentration of cardiac Troponin T ( electrochemiluminescence `` ECLIA '' , Roche ) preoperatively and next 72h from cross-clamp removal . At the same time points the level of creatine kinase isoenzyme MB will be assessed ( enzymatic assay , Roche ) . The area under the curve of the marker level over time will be compared between the groups . To assess the myocardial function all patients will have pulmonary artery catheter ( Swan Ganz catheter ) inserted preoperatively . Full hemodynamic assessment ( thermodilution method ) as well as oxygen metabolism status based on arterial and mixed venous gas analysis will be performed preoperatively and next 48h after aortic cross-clamp removal . Apart from measuring cardiac index we will calculate left and right cardiac work indices . The oxygen delivery index and extraction ratio will be calculated . The lactate levels will also be measured . The investigators will also assess the need for inotropic support at the same time points using so called inotropic index . All patients will have postoperative electrocardiogram on day 2 and 4 as per postoperative care routine and additionally on 1st day after operation . Similarly other routine postoperative tests that are performed as part of the routine postoperative care will be performed , monitored and used to look for the differences in postoperative course . This includes echocardiography as well as creatinine ( eGFR ) .",2013-11-20,"January 10, 2018","Inclusion Criteria : Patients of both genders .

Wake Forest University Health Sciences,NCT01996605,Efficacy of Spinal Oxytocin in Healthy Volunteers,Wake Forest University Health Sciences,2,0,Healthy Volunteer Study,Drug,Oxytocin 15 mcg,Basic Science,Triple,The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of intrathecal oxytocin on areas and intensity of hyperalgesia and allodynia induced by topical capsaicin .,"Purpose : There is a strong experimental basis to support the study of oxytocin by the spinal route for analgesia in humans . Oxytocin containing cells in the dorsal parvocellular division of the paraventricular nucleus ( PVN ) project to the spinal cord ( 1 ) . Noxious stimulation activates these cells via the A1 noradrenergic relay in the pons ( 2 ) and produces analgesia by spinal release of oxytocin , since intrathecal injection of an oxytocin receptor antagonist worsens pain behaviors from peripheral inflammation ( 3 ) . Direct electrical stimulation of the PVN reduces dorsal horn neuronal responses to noxious stimulation , and this is blocked by administration of sequestering antibody for oxytocin ( 4 ) . Similarly , direct electrical stimulation of the PVN reduces behavioral sensitivity in a model of chronic neuropathic pain , and this effect is blocked by an oxytocin receptor antagonist ( 5 ) . Intrathecal injection of oxytocin in normal rats reduces dorsal horn neuronal responses to noxious stimuli ( 6 ) as well as behavioral responses to noxious thermal ( 3 ) , mechanical ( 3 ) , and chemical ( 7 ) stimuli . Finally , intrathecal injection of oxytocin in rat models of chronic pain also reduces dorsal horn neuronal responses to sensory stimulation ( 6 ) as well as behavioral responses to thermal ( 5 ) and mechanical ( 7 ) stimuli . Rationale : We anticipate that oxytocin will be effective after spinal injection in humans against chemical induced hypersensitivity states .

Women who wish to have a levonorgestrel IUD placed after their birth , wish to breastfeed , and are willing to participate in the study will be randomly assigned to either get the IUD placed immediately after delivery of the baby and placenta or 4-6 weeks later . We do not believe there will be a difference in breastfeeding 8 weeks after delivery between those who get the IUD placed early or later .","Increasing use of the levonorgestrel intrauterine device ( LNG IUD ) has become a cornerstone of U.S. efforts to decrease our nation 's high rate of unplanned pregnancy . Many women initiate use of this method in the post partum period . The major advantage of immediate postplacental LNG IUD insertion is the prompt initiation of a highly effective contraceptive method at a time that does not interfere with the intense demands of newborn care , but any contraceptive method initiated in the postpartum period must not interfere with breastfeeding . Our long-term goal is to understand the impact of hormonal contraceptives , initiated early in the postpartum period , on breastfeeding . The central hypothesis is that quality of breastfeeding is not negatively affected by progestin-only hormonal contraceptives . We will pursue three specific aims comparing women randomized to immediate post-placental vs. delayed ( 4-6 week ) postpartum LNG IUD insertion : Aim # 1 : To determine breastfeeding continuation rates at 8 weeks in both groups Aim # 2 : To determine timing of lactogenesis in both groups Aim # 3 : To assess breastfeeding continuation , exclusivity , and satisfaction as well as continuation and satisfaction with the LNG IUD at 26 weeks postpartum in both groups This proposal will support a non-inferiority RCT where participants will be randomly assigned to immediate postplacental insertion ( within 10 minutes of placental delivery ) or delayed postpartum insertion ( 4-6 weeks postpartum ) .

UMC Utrecht,NCT01999309,Simvastatin Addition for Patients With Recent-onset Schizophrenia,Iris Sommer,3,1,Schizophrenia,Drug,Simvastatin,Treatment,Quadruple,"Rationale : There is ample evidence that inflammatory processes play a role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia . Although Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs ( NSAIDs ) have been shown to be able to reduce symptoms in these patients , these drugs either have unfavourable cardiovascular side effects or are otherwise not well tolerated . Moreover , patients with schizophrenia already tend to have an increased cardiovascular risk . The combination of well-established vascular protection and reduction of inflammation by simvastatin offers a highly attractive potential to further improve the treatment of schizophrenia and related disorders . Hypotheses : Daily treatment with 40mg simvastatin in addition to antipsychotic treatment reduces psychotic symptoms , improves cognition , attenuates brain volume loss , and decreases the risk for metabolic syndrome as well as for movement disorders , when compared to placebo . Objective : The primary objective of this trial is to investigate the proposed beneficial effect of simvastatin as compared to placebo when given for one year in addition to antipsychotic medication to patients with psychotic disorder . We expect lower symptom severity as measured with the PANSS ( Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale ) and less cognitive decline as measured with the BACS ( Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia ) .Secondary objectives are assessment of general functioning , presence and severity of metabolic syndrome and degree of movement disorders , and assessments of brain volume . Lastly , we examine various immunological parameters in serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells and the experience of childhood trauma . Study design : Randomized placebo-controlled double-blind trial . Study population : 150 men and women , between 18 and 50 years of age , diagnosed with schizophrenia , schizoaffective or schizophreniform disorder ( DSM-IV 295 . * ) or psychosis NOS ( not otherwise specified ) ( 298.9 ) . Onset of first psychosis no longer than 3 years ago . Intervention : Patients will be randomized 1:1 to either 40 mg simvastatin or placebo daily , in the form of identical tablets .","Rationale : Different lines of evidence now suggest that low grade inflammation in the central nervous system is involved in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia . These include the altered risk of schizophrenia patients and their relatives for specific auto-immune diseases , clinical similarities between the course of schizophrenia and auto-immune disease and decreased prevalence of schizophrenia in men who have used Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs ( NSAIDs ) or glucocorticosteroids for somatic disorders . Furthermore , an infectious cause or trigger is suggested by the observed association between schizophrenia and pre- and perinatal infections , as well as by seroconversion to certain pathogens in patients with schizophrenia . On a cellular level , inflammation of the central nervous system is suggested by an increased number of activated microglia cells in the brains of patients with schizophrenia as visualized by positron electron tomography . In an activated state , microglia cells can produce free radicals , pro-inflammatory components and other neurotoxic substances , causing cell death in their proximity . The activation of microglia cells provides a possible route by which an increased pro-inflammatory state in the brain could cause increased gray matter loss and more severe negative and cognitive symptoms . Although Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs ( NSAIDs ) have been shown to be able to reduce symptoms in these patients , these drugs either have unfavourable cardiovascular side effects or are otherwise not well tolerated . Moreover , patients with schizophrenia already tend to have an increased cardiovascular risk .

Duration of disease should be no more than three years . Intervention : Patients will be randomized 1:1 to either 40 mg simvastatin or placebo daily , in the form of identical tablets . Main study parameters/endpoints : Primary outcome is change in total symptom severity ( PANSS score ) from baseline to end of treatment . Secondary outcomes will be the changes in GAF scores , cognitive functioning , presence and severity of metabolic syndrome and movement disorders and assessment of brain volume change , in addition to the measurement of various immunological biomarkers , childhood trauma . and depression symptoms .

However , transplant is often complicated by inflammation , infection and other co-morbidities . In addition , these disorders have been shown to be cured with partial chimerism , making them an ideal target for the use of reduced intensity approaches , where a portion of patients may not achieve full donor chimerism , but instead achieve stable mixed chimerism . Reduced-intensity conditioning strategies have demonstrated improved survival with decreased Treatment Related Mortality ( TRM ) in institutional series for patients with HLH ( Cooper et al. , 2006 ; Marsh et al. , 2010 ; Marsh et al. , 2011 ) . However , graft loss and unstable chimerism remain challenges .

Cyclosporine is a drug that is FDA-approved to prevent organ rejection after kidney , liver , and heart transplant but is not approved by the FDA for Interstitial Cystitis . Several research studies have been published showing that Cyclosporine can improve the symptoms of Interstitial Cystitis , that it works better than a placebo ( `` sugar pill '' or inert treatment ) and that it works more effectively than Pentosan Polysulfate ( Elmiron ) , which is an FDA approved therapy . The dose of Cyclosporine used in these studies on Interstitial Cystitis are much lower that the doses used to prevent rejection in transplant patients . Based on these studies , the American Urological Association has recently published treatment guidelines that recommend Cyclosporine therapy for Interstitial Cystitis after the failure of other more conservative therapies and medications . Nevertheless , much is not known about using Cyclosporine therapy for Interstitial Cystitis including the mechanism of action , the ideal dose , how best to monitor for side effects and in particular whether kidney damage can occur at the low doses used in these studies . In this study , to examine the mechanism of action , blood and urine samples will be collected before , during and after therapy to look at `` biomarkers '' , chemical substances that can be associated with inflammation and tissue injury . We will also test effects of therapy on skin sensation and pain perception because the molecule which Cyclosporine binds to ( calcineurin ) is also found in nerves that conduct pain signals .

Continuous femoral nerve block has been used to enhance post op pain relief ( POPR ) for TKR but at the expense of motor blockade . A Sub sartorial approach to saphenous nerve block ( SNB ) spares the motor block . To date the role of saphenous nerve block for POPR in TKR has not been evaluated . Methodology : In order to test this hypothesis , we proposed to carry out a prospective randomized controlled double blinded ( surgeon and assessor ) trial study . With institutional ethics approval and having obtained written informed consent from each patient , 20 ASA 1 - 3 patients scheduled to undergo TKR under spinal anesthesia +/- sedation were allocated to one of two groups i.e .

Cancer chemotherapy frequently results in neutropenia ( low blood counts ) when patients are susceptible to severe infections . A medicine called G-CSF ( filgrastim ) stimulates bone marrow and daily filgrastim shots are commonly used to shorten neutropenic periods and decrease infections after chemotherapy . Since filgrastim is customarily used on a fixed schedule starting early after chemotherapy and there are data that early doses may not be needed , this study tests new flexible schedule of filgrastim to optimize its use by reducing the number of painful shots , cost of treatment , and filgrastim side effects in children with cancer receiving chemotherapy .","PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare the effect of flexible vs. fixed administration of G-CSF ( filgrastim ) on the parameters of hematological recovery including duration of absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) = 1,000/uL and time to platelet recovery > = 75,000/uL in children receiving myelotoxic chemotherapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare the effect of flexible vs. fixed administration of G-CSF on the incidence of febrile neutropenia and number of hospital days on antibiotics following myelotoxic chemotherapy . II . To evaluate the number of days of platelet transfusion events after chemotherapy cycles with flexible vs. fixed administration of G-CSF . III . To evaluate on the incidence and duration of G-CSF-related side effects including extremities/back pain and headaches after chemotherapy courses followed by flexible vs. fixed administration of G-CSF .

NYU Langone Health,NCT01987219,The Effects Of Bronchodilator Therapy On Respiratory And Autonomic Function In Patients With Familial Dysautonomia,NYU Langone Health,3,1,Familial Dysautonomia,Drug,Albuterol-sulphate,Treatment,Double,"Evaluate the effects of bronchodilator therapy on respiratory function . Our overall goal is to determine whether , in patients with familial dysautonomia ( FD ) , there is a component of airway obstruction that is reversible . To this end , we will evaluate airway resistance before and after receiving the anti-cholinergic ipratropium ( Atrovent ® ) and the beta-2-agonist albuterol ( ProVentil®/Ventolin® ) . We predict that the response to either drug will depend on the underlying level of sympathetic and parasympathetic activity and airway tone . We will then determine the cardiovascular effects of inhaled ipratropium and albuterol in patients with FD . Because patients with FD have fewer sympathetic neurons and denervation supersenstivity , we predict that following albuterol inhalation , there will be non-selective activation of alpha-1-adrenergic receptors . Furthermore , because of a congenital defect in the afferent baroreceptor neurons that sense blood pressure , we suspect that the resulting vasoconstriction will be unopposed leading to a pressor effect . We hypothesize that inhalation of the anti-cholinergic ipratopium will produce little rise in heart rate , due to the extent of parasympathetic denervation to the heart .","Familial dysautonomia ( FD ) is a rare fatal autosomal recessive disease caused by a deficiency of the protein IKAP.1 This results in a selective developmental defect that affects mostly afferent ( sensory ) neurons including those in the dorsal root ganglia and cranial nerves.2 , 3 We have shown recently that the protein deficiency impairs the development of afferent baroreceptor pathways , leaving the sympathetic efferent neurons reduced in number but functionally active . This results in the complete failure to detect and buffer fluctuations in blood pressure leading to volatile hypertension . In addition to the afferent baroreflex pathways , the deficiency of IKAP during embroyogenesis also affects the function of the chemoreflex pathways . As a result , patients fail to increase ventilation adequately in response to hypoxia and hypercapnia.4 As well as the impairment of the neurological mechanisms that regulate breathing , patients with FD also have a combination of obstructive , restrictive and probably also neuromuscular lung disease . Failure to coordinate swallowing results in recurrent bouts of aspiration pneumonia occurring from birth.5 , 6 Imaging studies show that almost all patients with FD have bronchial wall thickening , atelectasis and almost 30 % have bronchiectasis7 . Pulmonary function tests show air flow limitation and associated lung restriction with reduction in diffusion capacity12 . Sudden attacks of asthma like wheezing are common 8 and frequently associated with emotional upset,5 a time when sympathetic outflow to the vasculature is increased heightened.3 There is also a component of restrictive lung disease , with a very high incidence of scoliosis , which frequently begins at an early age . Complicating matters further , many patients opt to undergo spine fusion surgery , 9 which could potentially worsen further chest wall compliance.10 Patients with FD also lack muscle spindles , 2 making it likely that they have neuromuscular abnormalities arising from the absence of proprioceptive feedback from the respiratory muscles involved in the coordination of breathing . Severe respiratory disease is a leading cause of death in patients with FD and many are treated empirically with inhaled bronchodilators . It is not known , however , whether these drugs are effective at reversing increased airway resistance . Hence , there is an urgent need to understand if the short acting beta-2-adrenergic agonist albuterol and the anticholinergic ipratropium , are effective bronchodilators . Furthermore , because treatment with these agents has potential cardiovascular side effects , we will also analyze their effects on blood pressure , heart rate and cardiac output .",2013-11-05,"April 26, 2016","Inclusion Criteria : 1 . Diagnosis of familial dysautonomia ( Riley-Day syndrome , hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type III ) 2 . Ages 12 and older : Bronchodilators are routinely used in young children with FD therefore they should be included in this study . The spirometry maneuver is highly dependent on patient cooperation and effort , and FD patients already have limitations that make the spirometry maneuver more problematic to perform such as difficulty with mouth closure and drooling . Therefore , we believe age 12 is a suitable age for FD patients to be included in this study , though in the general population reliable results can be obtained from the age of 6 and sometimes even younger . 3 . Patients using Albuterol or Ipratroprium will be included in the study but will be instructed not to take the 24 hours prior to the testing . It is a common practice in clinical medicine to withhold the inhalation drugs prior to performing pulmonary function tests in order to evaluate the response to bronchodilators , an integral part of the test . Patients with an acute respiratory exacerbation will not be enrolled , as withholding bronchodilators would not be advisable . 4 . Patients who are taking medications that might affect autonomic function such as anti-hypertensives , beta-blockers , midodrine and florinef will be included in the study and we will record current medication regimen and the time the medication was taken .

Drugs for Neglected Diseases,NCT01980199,Trial to Determine Efficacy of Fexinidazole in Visceral Leihmaniasis Patients in Sudan,Drugs for Neglected Diseases,2,0,Visceral Leishmaniasis,Drug,Fexinidazole,Treatment,,This study is designed to determine the efficacy of Fexinidazole as an oral treatment in Visceral Leishmanisasis sudanese adults patients . The results of this proof of concept study will allow to make a decision on whether to proceed with clinical development of Fexinidazole for visceral leishmaniasis .,"Visceral Leishmaniasis ( VL ) is a neglected disease and it is fatal if left untreated . Until recently the first line treatment in East Africa was 30 days of Sodium Stibogluconate which can be cardiotoxic . Since 2010 WHO recommended Sodium Stibogluconate and Paromomycin for 17 days which is a shorter treatment but there remains the toxicity associated with these drugs . The second line treatment is Ambisome given as 6-10 intravenous infusions , whilst this has a better safety profile than other VL regimens it is expensive . So there is an urgent need for short course oral treatment for VL particularly in the East African region . Fexinidazole is a 2 substituted 5-nitroimidazole formulated for oral administration . Fexinidazole through its metabolites has demonstrated potent activity againts L. donovani intracellular amastigotes in vitro and in vivo in a visceral leishmaniasis mouse model . The dose selected for this study ( 1800 mg/1200 mg for 4/6 days ) has been based on the dose selected for a phase II trial on Human African Trypasonomiasis . It is albeit well tolerated and is one dose level below the maximum tolerated dose level established in phase I . The trial is designed and will be analysed according to a sequential method known as the triangular test , using day 28 data . This sequential design allows for repeated interim analysis ( every 10 patients ) . The null hypothesis is that the proportion cured is less than or equal to 75 % . The primary endpoint is initial cure at day 28 . The primary population for interim analyses and interim decision making will be the per protocol population.In the final analysis of cumulative patient data , Intention to Treat and Per Protocol Population analyses will be conducted . The conventional 6 months ( day 210 ) follow up outcome is still an important secondary endpointfor the final decision on whether to proceed with clinical development of Fexinidazole for VL .",2013-11-04,"October 29, 2015","Inclusion Criteria : Patients with clinical signs and symptoms of primary VL ( fever for at least 2 weeks , splenomegaly ) and diagnosis confirmed by visualization of parasites in tissue samples ( lymph node , bone marrow ) on microscopy .

"University of California, San Diego",NCT01987609,Effects of Subcutaneous Hyaluronidase Administration on Psoriatic Plaques,"Tissa Hata, MD",2,1,Psoriasis,Drug,Hylenex,Treatment,Triple,"Dendritic cells are a key component of the inflammatory response seen in psoriasis . Several current psoriasis therapies have been shown to reduce the number of dendritic cells in patients with psoriasis , leading researchers to believe that therapies specifically targeting dendritic cells may lead to improvement in psoriasis . Research recently conducted in Dr. Gallo 's lab at the University of California San Diego has shown that transgenic mice overexpressing the enzyme hyaluronidase have a significant decrease in the number of dendritic cells in the dermal component of their skin compared to wild type mice . If hyaluronidase overexpression in humans also decreases the number of dendritic cells in the dermis , then hyaluronidase therapy may improve the clinical presentation of psoriasis . In order to test this hypothesis , recombinant human hyaluronidase ( Hylenex® ) will be injected subcutaneously below a psoriatic plaque in human psoriasis patients every week for a total of 4 weeks . Each week the clinical appearance of the plaque will be documented . At the final visit skin biopsies of the treated plaque will be taken to visualize the histology of the plaque and look for changes in expression of different inflammatory markers .","Participation in this study will consist of a total of 5 visits to the UCSD Dermatology Clinic over approximately a one-month period . At the first visit , two psoriatic plaques between 2-cm and 5-cm in diameter to be studied in this trial will be agreed upon by the patient as well as the blinded and unblinded investigators . Preference will be given to plaques on the elbows since the elbow is a common place of psoriatic plaques , and since scarring on the elbows is usually more acceptable than scarring on other parts of the skin since the skin on the elbows is naturally hyperpigmented in most people . For the remainder of the study , all grading and measurements of the psoriatic plaques will be completed by a blinded investigator who is unaware of which plaque is receiving which treatment . An unblinded investigator will complete all other portions of the study visit , including digital photography , injecting the plaques , and completing the biopsies . The subject will also be blinded as to which plaque is being injected with which treatment . During the first 4 visits , plaques will be injected with 1-mL of Hylenex® or 1-mL of sterile ( pharmaceutical grade ) normal saline ( NS ) . 1-mL of Hylenex® contains 150 Units of recombinant hyaluronidase . This is the standard dose of the drug that has been approved by the FDA , and therefore this dose is considered to be safe for use in adults . If injected subcutaneously into the center of a psoriatic plaque that is between 2 and 5 centimeters in diameter , this 1-mL dose should be able to diffuse throughout the entire area beneath the plaque . The exact pharmacokinetics of Hylenex® are difficult to study due to its rapid inactivation after intravenous injection . According to the Hylenex® package insert , though , disruptions to the dermal barrier that occur in response to subcutaneous Hylenex® injection persist 24 hours after injection , but this barrier is completely restored after 48 hours . Cutaneous dendritic cells residing in the epidermis are thought to migrate away from the epidermis through either lymphatic or vascular channels after Hylenex® is injected . This process should take a few hours . Since cutaneous dendritic cells are thought to turnover only every several weeks , new dendritic cells should not populate the epidermis before patients receive the next injection of Hylenex® . Since dendritic cell activation initiates the inflammatory cascade thought to result in psoriasis , preventing dendritic cells from being harbored in the epidermis should essentially prevent the inflammatory cascade that results in psoriasis . Therefore , during the month-long period while patients are receiving Hylenex® injections , the inflammatory cascade triggering their psoriasis will potentially be turned off , allowing affected plaques to heal without propagation of further psoriasis . If this is true , there should be differences in the Hylenex®-treated versus the NS-treated plaques both morphologically and histologically upon completion of the final set of biopsies on the Visit 5 .",2013-11-12,"December 28, 2018","Inclusion Criteria : Diagnosis of plaque psoriasis for at least 6 months , with at least 2 psoriatic plaques on different parts of the body that are both between 2-cm and 5-cm in diameter at the time of screening Age 18-65 years Male subjects who agree to use barrier methods for contraception throughout the course of the trial if their female partners are of child-bearing potential , or female subjects not of child-bearing potential Subject agrees to comply with study requirements Subject is fluent in English and is able to provide written informed consent Exclusion Criteria : Subjects with severe medical condition ( s ) that in the view of the investigator prohibits participation in the study Subject has Netherton 's syndrome or other genodermatoses that result in a defective epidermal barrier Subjects who have applied topical medications ( prescription or over-the-counter ) for the treatment of psoriasis to their body within 7 days of the baseline visit Subjects who have taken cyclosporine , methotrexate , immuran , oral retinoids , chemotherapeutic agents , anti-inflammatory biologics ( e.g. , alefacept , etanercept , etc . ) , or oral calcineurin inhibitors within 28 days of the baseline visit Subjects who are unable to hold their current psoriasis medications for the period of time indicated ( at least 7 days for topical medications , at least 28 days for oral or injectable medications ) without significant worsening of their psoriasis Immunocompromised subjects ( e.g. , lymphoma , HIV/AIDS , Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome ) , or subjects with a history of malignant disease ( excluding non-melanoma skin cancer ) as determined by the participant 's medical history .

VA Office of Research and Development,NCT01981356,Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for the Inpatient Treatment of Psychosis,VA Office of Research and Development,0,1,Psychotic Disorders,Behavioral,Acceptance and Commitment Therapy,Treatment,,"There is a substantial need for enhancing the efficacy and effectiveness of Veterans Health Administration ( VHA ) inpatient services for psychosis and tailoring them to support recovery . The proposed pilot study will explore whether Acceptance and Commitment Therapy ( ACT ) , a recovery-oriented , evidence-based inpatient treatment , is a feasible , acceptable , safe , and effective adjunct for the inpatient treatment of Veterans with psychosis at a single VHA site . Additionally , an evaluation of barriers and facilitators to future implementation will be conducted . If promising , the data gained from the proposed study will support future evaluation , implementation and dissemination efforts that have the potential to improve inpatient treatment for psychosis and recovery , and thus , the lives of Veterans , while reducing costs for VHA .","Within the Veterans Health Administration ( VHA ) in fiscal year 2011 , patients with psychotic disorders represented approximately 4 % of the total population , and received approximately 14 % of VHA 's total expenditures ( Blow et al. , 2011 ) . Patients with psychosis receive substantial , repeated , and costly inpatient treatment , and this is often the only chance to provide treatment due to gaps in mental health service utilization ( Blow et al. , 2011 ; McCarthy et al. , 2007 ) . Thus , there is an urgent need for enhancing the efficacy and effectiveness of VHA inpatient services and tailoring them to better support recovery . Acceptance and Commitment Therapy ( ACT ) , a recovery-oriented , evidence-based adjunct to inpatient treatment for psychosis , is an excellent candidate for investigations within VHA inpatient settings . ACT for psychosis is considered an empirically supported treatment by the American Psychological Association ( APA , 2012 ; Chambless et al. , 1998 ) . A consistent body of research has demonstrated the clinical effectiveness of ACT for treatment of psychosis , including well-designed randomized clinical trials of ACT on inpatient settings ( Bach & Hayes , 2000 ; Gaudiano & Herbert , 2006 ) . ACT is effective when provided in a flexible format of three to four sessions , and for patients with a range of chronic and severe psychotic and comorbid mental disorders . This proposed pilot study aims to explore ACT as an adjunct to inpatient treatment as usual ( TAU ) for psychosis among VHA patients at one VHA inpatient psychiatry unit . The project will use an effectiveness/ implementation Hybrid Type 1 design that incorporates a pilot RCT and semi-formative evaluation of barriers and facilitators to future implementation . Participants will be 80 VHA patients with current psychotic symptoms ( hallucinations and/or delusions ) related to a psychotic or mood disorder who are admitted to an inpatient psychiatry unit VA Palo Alto Health Care System ( VAPAHCS ) . Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either TAU ( n = 40 ) , or TAU with plus 4-sessions of ACT ( n = 40 ) individually provided during their stay on the inpatient unit . Aim 1 is to investigate the feasibility , acceptability , and safety of the treatment for VHA patients , as indexed by : ( a ) the ability to recruit and consent 2 eligible participants per week ( for 40 weeks ) to participate in the study and be randomized to ACT + TAU or TAU ; ( b ) patient attendance of 3 ACT individual sessions ( out of 4 possible ) on average ; ( c ) patient and ACT Facilitator ( provider of the intervention ) , reported ACT treatment satisfaction and alliance ; and ( d ) the occurrence of zero serious adverse events attributable to the ACT treatment . Aim 2 is to investigate treatment effects of ACT on patient functioning ( i.e. , acceptance ) , symptomatology , distress , and affect . Aim 3 is to obtain data from participating patients and unit staff regarding system- , clinician- and patient-level barriers and facilitators to implementing staff-delivered ACT services for psychosis at the participating VHA inpatient setting , including : ( a ) barriers that limit patients , staff , and site participation in ACT and how to address them ; ( b ) provider and patient perceptions about why ACT is successful at achieving better outcomes ; ( c ) site specific and general barriers to implementation of ACT and how to address them ; and ( d ) perceived value of and how to sustain ACT in the absence of a funded project . This project is the first step in exploring a potentially sustainable and effective intervention that will improve inpatient psychosis treatment and recovery , and hence , the lives of VHA patients with psychosis , while reducing costs for VHA . If promising , study findings will support a HSR & D Investigator Initiated Research ( IIR ) Merit grant application that will propose to assess the effectiveness and cost of implementing the ACT intervention , and potential barriers and facilitators for implementation efforts at multiple VHA inpatient psychiatric units .

Brown University,NCT01989507,Very Low-Nicotine Cigarettes in Smokers With SUD,Brown University,2,1,Nicotine Dependence,Drug,Nicotine,Treatment,Quadruple,"The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy , acceptability and unintended consequences of very low nicotine content cigarettes ( VLNCC ) in smokers with current or past year substance use disorders ( SUD ) . The primary aim of this study is to determine whether 6 weeks of VLNCC compared to normal nicotine content cigarettes ( NNCC ) will result in more smoking cessation over 6 months and reduce cigarette use , cotinine , and biomarkers of toxicity . We will also assess the effects of VLNCC versus NNCC cigarettes on frequency of substance use and substance cravings ( drugs and alcohol ) because this is relevant to the safety of these products among smokers with SUD . Secondary aims are to study effects on cigarette craving , nicotine withdrawal and dependence , and depressed mood . Methods : Random assignment to VLNCC versus NNCC of up to 312 smokers with SUD will be balanced by gender , degree of tobacco dependence , and recent drug and alcohol use . All smokers will be provided with smoking counseling . Assessments over 6 months will assess effects both during the 6 weeks of using research cigarettes and after return to usual cigarettes . The importance is in determining the viability and safety of this public health strategy in terms of effects on both smoking and other substance use in a highly addicted population , which is essential to determine before the FDA implements this policy .","The 2009 passage of the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act ( FSPTCA ) gave the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) the authority to reduce levels of nicotine in cigarettes if appropriate for public health . This project addresses an area targeted for study by NIH and the FDA to assess the impact of products with reduced toxicity on tobacco use behaviors . Very-low nicotine content cigarettes ( VLNCC ) have been shown in some studies with smokers from the general population to reduce craving and withdrawal for tobacco relative to abstinence with little or no compensatory smoking , suggesting that a mandated reduction in the nicotine yield of cigarettes could substantially reduce smoking rates . This may be a particularly effective method of reducing smoking and smoking-related disease in special populations that have very high rates of tobacco dependence , such as people with substance use disorders ( SUD ) . However , the consequences of this policy for smokers with SUD have not been investigated , and a call has gone out for studies of the safety of these products with vulnerable populations such as these . The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy , acceptability and unintended consequences of VLNCC in smokers with SUD ( current or past year ) currently abstinent from hard drugs . The primary aims are to determine whether VLNCC will increase smoking cessation and reduce cigarette use , cotinine , and biomarkers of toxicity in smokers with SUD relative to baseline and to those randomized to a normal nicotine content cigarette ( NNCC ) , and to determine any unintended effects of VLNCC on substance use and cravings to use substances so as to investigate safety . Secondary aims are to study effects on cigarette craving and nicotine withdrawal and dependence ( mechanisms ) , and state depression ( safety ) . A 2-group between-group by pre-post design will compare 6 weeks of VLNCC to NNCC ; all smokers will also be provided with smoking counseling .

Treatment is thus expected to induce a maximum tumor shrinkage within a short period ( usually 3-6 months ) . In addition Bevacizumab ( Avastin ) is to be administered as early as possible during the disease stages . The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the preliminary antitumor activity in terms of pathological complete responses ( pCR ) of bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy .,"The aim of administering systemic therapy prior to surgery is to make a locally advanced tumor operable or to allow conservative surgery in the case of a T2-T3 tumor . Therefore , treatment is expected to induce a maximum tumor shrinkage within a short period . In addition and based on the anti-angiogenic MoA , bevacizumab ( Avastin ) is to be administered as early as possible during the disease stages . Bevacizumab has already been tested in the neoadjuvant setting with encouraging results . In a first trial patients with inoperable locally advanced breast cancer received docetaxel with or without bevacizumab with five clinical Complete Responses and 24 Partial Responses . In a second trial there was also reported the results of the combination of bevacizumab with doxorubicin and docetaxel for the treatment of inflammatory breast cancer . Then , a set of studies of primary therapy exploring the activity of different regimens have confirmed the role of baseline pathological features of the tumor in predicting the responsiveness to primary therapy . A 22 % pathological complete responses ( pCR ) rate has been achieved in a study combining bevacizumab together with Xeloda and Taxotere suggesting that bevacizumab addition to chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant treatment is feasible showing promising activity while no unexpected toxicities were reported .

Johns Hopkins University,NCT01980342,Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of the Etonogestrel Contraceptive Implant When Co-administered With Efavirenz,Johns Hopkins University,4,0,Drug Interaction,Drug,Efavirenz,Other,,"This study evaluates whether there is an interaction between etonogestrel , the progestin hormone released by the contraceptive implant Nexplanon , and efavirenz , a common medication used to treat HIV . The endpoints measured in this study will help determine if such an interaction leads to decreased contraceptive efficacy of the contraceptive implant .","Women now make up nearly half of the world 's HIV-infected population , and many of these women with HIV are of reproductive age . There is a growing need to provide effective contraception for those women who want or need to be protected against pregnancy . However , there is concern for decreased contraceptive efficacy in women on antiretroviral therapy who rely on hormonal contraception due to drug-drug interactions . Of particular concern is a possible interaction with etonogestrel , the active hormone in a long-acting reversible contraceptive implant . We propose a pilot study to evaluate the effect of efavirenz ( EFV ) , a commonly used non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor , on the pharmacokinetics of the etonogestrel implant . We will recruit 18 healthy women who have had the implant in place for 12 to 24 months . They will be asked to take a two-week course of efavirenz . During these two weeks and for four additional weeks , we will monitor semi-weekly etonogestrel concentrations , and serum , ultrasound , and cervical mucus markers of ovulation . We will also assess efavirenz concentration at baseline and at the end of the two-week treatment course . We will derive pharmacokinetic parameters and compare concentrations across time points . Results will help to inform the design of larger studies , and of similar studies with different antiretroviral medications .

Johns Hopkins University,NCT02124265,Oral Rehydration Therapy in Burn Patients,Johns Hopkins University,1,0,Burn Any Degree Involving 20-29 Percent of Body Surface,Drug,CeraLyte 90,Treatment,,"In patients with moderate to severe thermal injuries ( > 20 % TBSA ) adequate fluid resuscitation is the main priority to achieve successful outcomes . Soon after burn injury substantial amounts of fluid accumulate rapidly in the wound while more is lost in the third space . Without intervention this process leads to hypotension and shock . The Parkland formula was devised to calculate how much intravenous ( IV ) fluid , i.e . crystalloids , is needed for adequate resuscitation during the first 24 hours post-burn . However , IV resuscitation can lead to overexpansion of ( third space ) volume , leading to severe complications such as compartment syndrome or pulmonary edema . In major population centers , catastrophic events causing mass casualties will disrupt many hospital and emergency services , potentially delaying acute IV fluid resuscitation . Burn patient case reports have shown that oral rehydration therapy ( ORT ) used to supplement or in place of IV therapy is efficacious . ORT could be easily applied in mass burn casualties . ORT is generally known in the third world for treating life-threatening dehydration due to diarrhea . The glucose-sodium co transport mechanism enables the affected human intestine to absorb a sufficient amount of water and electrolytes to replace large fluid losses due to severe diarrhea , even under adverse field conditions . No electrolyte disturbances have been recorded in such cases . Studies on enteral resuscitation in animal burn models showed high rates of small intestinal absorption which should be adequate for resuscitation following major burn injury . The optimal composition of oral rehydration solution for resuscitation in burn wounds has not been determined . In cholera patients , Ceralyte® has proven superior to the World Health Organization Oral Rehydration Solution , increasing fluid absorption of the intestine . The Ceralyte® 90 solution , with 90mEq/L sodium and a low osmolarity of < 275mOsm , may also contribute to optimal intestinal fluid uptake without causing electrolyte disturbances in thermal injury . ORT use might reduce the occurrence of compartment syndrome and pulmonary edema since fluid is regulated by the intestine according to physiologic requirements . The investigators propose to conduct a prospective study using Ceralyte® 90 to show that oral resuscitation therapy ( ORT ) in burns can reduce the total amount of IV fluid needed for adequate resuscitation and to test the efficacy and safety of ORT in the resuscitation of burn patients .",Primary objectives To show that ORT in burns ( using Ceralyte® 90 ) can reduce the total amount of intravenous fluid needed for adequate resuscitation .

"University College, London",NCT02022358,Will Glucarpidase After Methotrexate Treatment for Bone Sarcoma Lead to Fewer Side Effects and Reduce Chemotherapy Delays?,"University College, London",2,0,Osteosarcoma,Drug,Glucarpidase,Treatment,,"Methotrexate is one of the most effective chemotherapy drugs in the treatment of osteosarcoma and some other types of bone sarcoma which are treated the same way as osteosarcoma . However , it frequently leads to sore mouth , tummy pain and increased risk of developing infections . The investigators try to save or `` rescue '' normal cells from the side effects of methotrexate by giving a drug called folinic acid . Folinic acid is started 24 hours after methotrexate and given regularly until methotrexate levels are really low and not dangerous to normal cells anymore . Despite this rescue , side effects are still a problem and many patients are not well enough to receive subsequent chemotherapy on time . Almost half of the planned chemotherapy cycles are not given on time due to methotrexate side effects . In this study the investigators will examine if adding a drug called glucarpidase to folinic acid is helpful . Glucarpidase is an enzyme that inactivates methotrexate in the blood stream . Lower methotrexate concentration in the blood stream leads to fewer side effects . The investigators would like to see if glucarpidase helps patients to have their chemotherapy on time , by reducing the side effects of methotrexate .","In this study the patient will receive 4 courses of high-dose methotrexate . High-dose methotrexate is normally given at weekly intervals , in blocks of two.The first two courses will be given on weeks 1 & 2 ; the second two courses on weeks 4 & 5 . Two courses will be given with folinic acid rescue ( standard high-dose methotrexate ) , and the other two will be given with glucarpidase rescue as well as folinic acid . This will enable us to compare whether there is any difference in side effects with and without glucarpidase and also how quickly patients recover from them . Half of the patients will receive standard high-dose methotrexate on weeks 1 & 2 and high-dose methotrexate with glucarpidase on weeks 4 & 5 ( arm A ) and half of the patients will first have high-dose methotrexate with glucarpidase on weeks 1 & 2 and then standard high-dose methotrexate on weeks 4 & 5 ( arm B ) . All patients receiving methotrexate have daily blood tests to monitor the levels of methotrexate in their body , and monitor their kidney function . However , patients on this study will have extra blood tests for chemotherapy drug levels and glucarpidase antibody levels . During each hospital admission for chemotherapy , blood samples will be taken as follows : Day 1 : Just before starting methotrexate ( extra blood test ) and at the end of methotrexate infusion ( extra blood test ) Day 2 : 24 hours after starting methotrexate ( routine blood test ) and 20 minutes after the 24-hour blood test ( i.e . just after the glucarpidase/placebo infusion ) ( extra blood test ) Day 3+ : Routine daily blood tests until the body has got rid of the methotrexate Extra blood samples will also be taken 15 days after starting each cycle and 1 month , 3 and 6 months , after starting the second cycle .

The most widely studied polymorphism of the OPRM1 gene is the Asn40Asp single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) , a functional mutation thought to affect receptor activity such that the Asp40 variant binds β-endorphin three times stronger than the Asn40 allele . Recent studies have found that Asp40 carriers have a stronger striatal dopamine response to intravenous alcohol administration and report stronger feelings of alcohol reward . Findings from the COMBINE Study demonstrated that if treated with Medication Management alone and naltrexone , 87.1 % of Asp40 carriers had a good clinical outcome , compared with only 54.8 % of Asn40 homozygotes . While these findings are promising , studies have also highlighted allele frequency imbalance as a function of ethnicity such that the Asp40 allele frequency is approximately 20 % in Caucasians , 5 % in individuals of African Ancestry , and as high as 50 % among individuals of East Asian descent . Therefore , to the extent to which this SNP moderates behavioral and clinical responses to NTX , ethnicity must be carefully considered in order to extend the findings from primarily Caucasian samples to ethnic minorities , such as Asian Americans . Preliminary work by our team has found that among individuals of East Asian descent , Asp40 carriers show greater NTX-induced blunting of alcohol craving as well as potentiation of the aversive effects of alcohol . This pilot study also found support for a gene dose-response , such that Asp40Asp individuals showed greater NTX responsivity than those with the Asn40Asp genotype . This study seeks to build upon these preliminary findings by testing heavy drinkers of East Asian descent across three OPRM1 genotypes ( Asn40Asn , n = 30 ; Asn40Asp , n = 30 , and Asp40Asp , n = 30 ) . Participants will complete two double-blinded , counterbalanced alcohol infusion and self-administration sessions , one after taking NTX ( 50 mg/day ) and one after taking matched placebo for five days . In each medication condition , participants will complete a functional neuroimaging task examining cue-induced craving for alcohol . This study will elucidate the pharmacogenetic effects of the Asn40Asp SNP of the OPRM1 gene on biobehavioral and neural markers of response to naltrexone in individuals of Asian descent , an ethnic group most likely to express the positive predictive allele ( Asp40 ) .

Because Te , E2 and GH fall with menopause , and Te is converted to E2 by aromatization in the body ( 8-10 ) , we postulate that diminished Te concentrations , Te→E2 concentrations and low E2 mediate low GH output in older women . What remains unknown is whether the low E2 levels in postmenopausal women retain GH-stimulating effects . To test this notion would require blocking : ( i ) aromatase-enzyme activity , which mediates E2 synthesis from Te , and/or ( ii ) estrogen receptor-alpha , which transduces most of E2 's stimulation of the GH axis .",2013-12-31,"March 14, 2016","Inclusion : 60 healthy post-menopausal women ( ages 55 to 80 y ) ; BMI 18-30 kg/m2 Community dwelling ; and voluntarily consenting Exclusion : Recent use of psychotropic or neuroactive drugs ( within five biological half-lives ) ; Obesity ( outside weight range above ) ; Laboratory test results not deemed physician acceptable , cholesterol > 250 , triglycerides > 300 , BUN > 30 or creatinine > 1.5 mg/dL , liver function tests exceeding twice upper limit of normal , electrolyte abnormality , anemia ; Drug or alcohol abuse , psychosis , depression , mania or severe anxiety ; Systemic inflammatory disease ; Endocrinopathy , other than primary thyroidal failure receiving replacement ; Nightshift work or recent transmeridian travel ( exceeding 3 time zones within 7 days of CRU admission ) ; Acute weight change ( loss or gain of > 2 kg in 6 weeks ) ; Systemic illness Unwillingness to provide written informed consent .

However , there is still much to learn about how to best care for the transplanted kidney and keep it working for a long time . Unless a person receiving a kidney from someone else takes drugs that reduce immune function , the kidney will be rejected . Those drugs must be continued life-long and cause many issues . Therefore , tolerance of the transplanted kidney , without chronic rejection and without the need for permanent immunosuppressive drug treatment , is a highly desirable goal . If this can be achieved , it would make `` one kidney for life '' possible . The study treatment includes several days of study medications followed by a kidney and bone marrow transplant . After the transplant , the study treatment will continue with a few more doses of study medications and then anti-rejection medication is started . After a while , the anti-rejection medication is slowly stopped .

Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria La Fe,NCT02174328,Prevention of Preeclampsia With Aspirin in Recipients of Donated Oocytes.,Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria La Fe,3,0,Pre-Eclampsia,Drug,Acetylsalicylic acid,Prevention,Triple,The main objective of this trial is to study the occurrence of preeclampsia in recipients of donated oocytes receiving aspirin at an early stage during pregnancy and to compare the results with those obtained in patients receiving placebo .,"Various markers have been proposed for the early diagnosis of preeclampsia : determination of mean arterial pressure ; presence of multiple risk factors of preeclampsia ; biochemical , ultrasound , and angiogenic markers ; uterine artery Doppler , etc . These are used to determinate which patients have an increased risk of developing preeclampsia during gestation , and therefore carry out closer monitoring of pregnancy in this population . In addition , these markers can also identify patients at increased risk of developing other problems such as IUGR or preterm labor . For nearly 30 years , there have been multiple studies trying to demonstrate that aspirin prevents the onset of preeclampsia with inconclusive results . However , recent studies in which aspirin was administered at an early stage ( before 16 weeks of gestation ) in patients at high risk of complications , have demonstrated a decrease in the incidence of this entity . Thus , administration of aspirin to patients at high risk ( patients classified with a high risk of complications during pregnancy , based on markers mentioned above ) seems to be useful in preventing onset of preeclampsia , IUGR and other complications , whenever it is administered at an early stage , as shown by several studies carried out so far . The incidence of preeclampsia , IUGR and other complications of pregnancy is increased in patients undergoing treatment for ovulation induction , being much higher in recipients of donated oocytes . It appears that this increase may be explained by immunological processes . The focus lies on the interaction between HLA-C fetal antigen with the maternal natural killer cells . We postulate , therefore , that the administration of aspirin in recipients of donated oocytes at an early stage of pregnancy , may also reduce the incidence of preeclampsia in this group of patients . Moreover , it has been observed that patients with preeclampsia exhibit lower levels of VEGF , PlGF and PAPP-A ( factors involved in placental angiogenesis ) and that this is accompanied by an increase in the sFlt1 ( a potent PIGF and VEGF antagonist ) .",2013-09-11,"April 25, 2019","Inclusion Criteria : Patients over 18 years .

Particularly , temporomandibular joint disorders involve a series of symptoms that refers both to intrinsic and extrinsic joint conditions where pain can be associated to a reduction of the joint movement , click or to other sounds of the joint . The lack of a recognized causal therapy led to the suggestion of many treatment modalities with a multidisciplinary approach for the management of symptoms that include the use of occlusal splints , physiotherapy-speech therapy , behavioral and physical therapy , drugs , chirurgical approaches . In most cases these strategies together allow the control of the symptoms , even though they are n't completely resolutive . In these patients is frequent chronic pain and ineffectiveness of common drugs used . It has been demonstrated how transcranial electrical brain stimulation with direct current ( tDCS ) is able to reduce the intensity and the duration of chronic pain . Stimulating the motor cortex can reduce pain by modulating brain activities in the areas involved in cerebral circuits controlling pain , such as thalamus , facilitating the descendant inhibitory mechanisms and enhancing the number of opiates receptors .

National Institutes of Health Clinical Center (CC),NCT01887132,A Trial of the Drug Donepezil for Sleep Enhancement and Behavioral Change in Children With Autism,National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH),2,0,Autism Spectrum Disorders,Drug,Donepezil,Treatment,Double,"Background : - Some children with autism spectrum disorders ( ASD ) do not have normal sleep cycles . Some of these children spend very little time in the rapid eye movement ( REM ) stage of sleep . Some studies suggest that less time in REM sleep can be associated with learning and behavior problems . Donepezil is a medication used to treat Alzheimer s disease . Donepezil can increase REM sleep in some adults with different disorders . A small study showed that Donepezil can also increase REM sleep in children with ASD . Researchers now want to see if Donepezil can improve communication skills and social interaction in children with ASD . They also want to see if any change in symptoms seems to come from changes in REM sleep . Objectives : - To see if a medication , Donepezil , can improve the way communication skills and social interaction develop in young children with autism spectrum disorders . Eligibility : - Children 22 to 44 months of age with ASD . Design : Participants will be screened with a blood test , heart tests , and a sleep study . During the sleep study , children will sleep in a darkened room for 2 nights with electrodes on their body and a tube under their nose . Parents can sleep in the room with their child . A technician will monitor the room all night . Participants will take the study medication once a day . Treatment will be monitored at visits every 3 months . At each visit the participant will take blood tests , heart tests , or behavior tests . Participants will have 2 more sleep studies . Participation will end after 18 months .","i . Objective The objective of this study is to investigate the efficacy of donepezil to improve the developmental trajectory for core behavioral domains specific to autism , namely reciprocal social interaction and communication . ii . Study population 90 children with an autism spectrum disorder between the ages of 24 to 50 months will be screened via polysomnogram to find 45 with a relative REM deficiency . This group will then be divided into two arms of drug versus placebo . Allowing for a 22 % drop out rate we expect 17 in each group to complete the study . Additionally , we will enroll 16 children with an ASD who do not meet criteria for relative REM deficiency in an open label arm to ascertain whether or not donepezil is beneficial to behavior in this group . iii . Design The proposal is for a 6 month treatment trial of 2.5 mg donepezil/placebo/day followed by 12 months of longitudinal follow-up . The primary study endpoint will be an examination of autism core symptoms and sleep architecture after 12 months . iv . Outcome measures The primary outcome measure will be : An improvement in the Expressive Language and the Receptive Language subscales of the Mullen Scales of Early Learning ( MSEL ) at 12 months . Secondary outcome measures will be : We will also measure the change in REM sleep parameters after 6 , 12 and 18 months in relation to improvements in behavioral indices . Exploratory Outcome Measures will be : An improvement in the Expressive Language and the Receptive Language subscales of the Mullen Scales at 18 months . An improvement on the severity scale of the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule ( ADOS ) at 6 , 12 and 18 months . An improvement on the Vineland at 3 , 6 , 12 and 18 months An exploratory analysis will investigate whether normalization of REM parameters also improves other measurements of sleep quality in children with autism .",2013-06-22,"September 21, 2017","INCLUSION CRITERIA : Diagnosis of an Autism Spectrum Disorder ( DSM-IV diagnoses of autistic disorder or Pervasive Developmental Disorder , Not Otherwise Specified ) .

"Gustave Roussy, Cancer Campus, Grand Paris",NCT01887522,"Study of Vinblastine in Combination With Nilotinib in Children, Adolescents, and Young Adults","Gustave Roussy, Cancer Campus, Grand Paris",2,0,Refractory Low-grade Gliomas,Drug,Vinblastine + Nilotinib,Treatment,,"Multicenter , open label , prospective study including successively a phase I trial and then a phase II trial Phase I : Open label , non-randomized , sequential dose escalation of both drugs , vinblastine and nilotinib .","Low grade gliomas ( LGG ) are the most frequent brain tumor type in children . They are often chemosensitive . However , more than 50 % of these tumors will progress within the first 5 years after the start of the treatment and need a second-line therapy . In most cases , patients are still young and the risk of side effects from radiation therapy will call for another medical treatment . If a tumor does not respond to first-line chemotherapy , the prognosis worsens with 25 % of deaths within the first 5 years for optic gliomas . Vinblastine ( Velbe® ) is an effective drug for low grade gliomas with both antiproliferative and antiangiogenic effects . An update of the Canadian phase II of weekly vinblastine ( 6 mg/m²/week ) reported one complete response ( CR ) , three partial responses ( PR ) and 9 minor responses ( MR ) in the first 31 patients . The 1-year progressionfree survival ( PFS ) rate was 57 % . Tolerance of the treatment is fair allowing prolonged maintenance therapy as in Langerhans cell histiocytosis and anaplastic large cell lymphoma ( ALCL ) . These data encourage proceeding with further testing this approach in pediatric low-grade glioma . Nilotinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) known to affect c-Kit , DDR1 and the PDGF receptors alpha and beta . PDGF is a growth factor for normal and tumoral astrocytes and oligodendrocytes . In addition , PDGF receptors are expressed on pediatric low-grade glioma vessels . Tumor response to this class of TKI has been reported occasionally . When used as monotherapy , this class of TKI was well tolerated in children , including those with brain tumors . Taking advantage of their different antiangiogenic mechanisms , their limited and non-overlapping toxicities , vinblastine and nilotinib could play an interesting role in the treatment of pediatric low-grade glioma . Nilotinib via PDGFRA and c-kit interactions may also interfere with the stroma of the tumor which is a key factor for tumor growth as shown in the NF1 mouse model . Both drugs have also immunostimulating effects especially in dendritic cells , that will be explored during treatment in selected patients . Previous to the phase II assessing the efficacy of the combination compared to vinblastine as single agent , nilotinib and vinblastine have to be administered by escalating dosages in order to identify the recommended doses of each agent when given in combination . This phase I part of the trial is justified by a possible interaction of the two drugs that are substrates of cytochrome P450 CYP3A4 . Initial/starting dose of nilotinib ( 115 mg/m² BID ) will be 50 % of the recommended dose when used as monotherapy in adults ( 800 mg/day : 400 mg BID =230 mg/m2 BID ) . Initial/starting dose of vinblastine will be 50 % of the recommended dose when used as monotherapy or in association with other chemotherapeutic drugs ( i.e . 3 mg/m2 once a week ) . This justifies obtaining pharmacokinetic data on both drugs when used in combination . A phase I trial evaluating nilotinib as single agent in pediatrics in hematological malignancies is ongoing , run by the ITCC and the COG group , exploring the dose-levels 230 mg/m² to 460 mg/m² BID . The results of this phase I trial , expected by 2012 , and the data of the current trial will be considered to decide whether a higher dose-level for nilotinib can be opened ( 350 mg/m² BID ) .",2013-06-19,"May 24, 2022","Inclusion Criteria : Written informed consent signed by the patient , or parents or legal representative and assent of the minor child .

Annually in the United States , approximately 2,200 children are diagnosed with CNS malignancy and rates appear to be increasing . CNS tumors are the leading cause of death from solid tumors in children . Survival duration after diagnosis in children is highly variable depending in part on age at diagnosis , location of tumor , and extent of resection ; however , most children with high grade glioma die within 3 years of diagnosis . All patients with high grade glioma experience a recurrence after first-line therapy , so improvements in both first-line and salvage therapy are critical to enhancing quality-of-life and prolonging survival . It is unknown if currently used intravenous ( IV ) therapies even cross the blood brain barrier ( BBB ) . We have shown in previous phase I trials that a single Superselective Intra-arterial Cerebral Infusion ( SIACI ) of Cetuximab and/or Bevacizumab is safe for the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) in adults , and we are currently evaluating the efficacy of this treatment . Therefore , this phase I/II clinical research trial is an extension of that trial in that we seek to test the hypothesis that intra-arterial Cetuximab and Bevacizumab is safe and effective in the treatment of relapsed/refractory glioma in patients < 22 years of age . We expect that this project will provide important information regarding the utility of SIACI Cetuximab and Bevacizumab therapy for malignant glioma in patients < 22 years of age and may alter the way these drugs are delivered to our patients in the near future .",The experimental aspects of this treatment plan will include : Subjects will first be treated with Mannitol prior to chemotherapy infusion ( Mannitol 25 % ; 10 mL over 2 minutes ) in order to disrupt the blood brain barrier .

Ketamine is a Food and Drug Administration approved anesthetic ( a drug used to produce loss of consciousness before and during surgery ) . Ketamine is not approved for the treatment of major depressive disorder and is considered experimental in this study . An additional purpose of this study is to research the effects of ketamine on brain function . You may qualify to take part in this research study because you have been diagnosed with major depressive disorder ( MDD ) and have not responded to past treatments .","Major Depressive Disorder ( MDD ) is a disabling medical illness and current monoaminergic treatments are slow to act and possess only limited efficacy . In this context , the discovery that the glutamate NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine is rapidly antidepressant ( onset of action within hours ) -- even in patients suffering from treatment-resistant depression ( TRD ) -- has ignited tremendous enthusiasm among clinicians , scientists and patients alike . A critical obstacle to the translation of this discovery into a novel treatment , however , is the limited duration of action following a course of ketamine ( e.g . 1-2 weeks ) . The current project will address this important gap in medical knowledge by testing a rational neuropharmacological strategy designed to optimize and sustain the rapid antidepressant effects of ketamine . Driven by the recent characterization of the molecular mechanisms underpinning the antidepressant and neuroplasticity effects of ketamine , we will test the combination of ketamine plus lithium in patients with TRD using a randomized , double blind , placebo-controlled design .

University of Nebraska,NCT01889992,Cardiac Allograft Remodeling and Effects of Sirolimus,University of Nebraska,1,0,Cardiac Hypertrophy,Radiation,Cardiac MRI,Treatment,,"Cardiac allograft remodeling causes poor quality of life , allograft failure and increased mortality after heart transplantation . Risk factors for cardiac allograft remodeling and its progression are poorly defined and there is a need for effective interventions.This is a multi-factorial phenomenon , associated with various immunological and non-immunological factors . Animal studies suggest M-TOR inhibition attenuates cardiac allograft remodeling secondary to down-regulation of M-TOR downstream targets and increased autophagy . There is a paucity of data regarding effect of Sirolimus , a M-TOR inhibitor , on human heart remodeling . This aim of the proposal to identify the prevalence of cardiac allograft remodeling on current immunosuppressive strategies and determine risk factors for its development . It will also identify molecular pathways associated with cardiac allograft remodeling and determine the impact of Sirolimus on these pathways .","Heart transplantation has become a well-established treatment option for patients with end-stage heart disease and currently has a one-year survival rate of 90 % , a five-year survival rate of 70 % , and 10-year survival rate of 50 % . The introduction of anti-rejection treatment thirty years ago with drugs known as calcineurin inhibitors have resulted in a significant improvement in the survival of heart transplant recipients . However , most of this improvement occurs during the first year after transplantation . Beyond the first year , the mortality rate of heart transplant recipients has not changed , which indicates that the causes of late complications have not been affected in the last three decades by improvements in post-transplant care . It becomes apparent that in order to improve the late outcomes , the focus in heart transplant research needs to be shifted to the prevention and the treatment of late complications . Cardiac allograft remodeling ( CAR ) , or changes in heart 's geometric pattern , is one of the common complications after heart transplantation and often inflicts poor quality of life , heart failure , and decreased survival . The risk factors and mechanism for the development and progression of CAR are poorly defined , and there is no effective treatment for this condition . In the proposed study , we will identify the prevalence , risk factors , and effect of CAR on physical capacity , cardiac vascular disease , and patient survival after a heart transplant . For assessment of heart geometry , we will use cardiac magnetic resonance imaging ( CMRI ) , a techniques used to visualize the internal structures of the body in detail . CMRI is considered as being a `` gold standard '' for evaluating the heart 's structure and function . We will also evaluate the molecular and genetic markers associated with development and progression of CAR after heart transplantation . The drug Sirolimus , a new anti-rejection agent , can be used in place of calcineurin inhibitors after heart transplantation . Recent experimental and animal studies indicate that Sirolimus can attenuate the changes in the heart 's geometry after a transplant ( i.e. , CAR ) and improve heart function . We will assess the effect of Sirolimus on CAR in humans and will evaluate molecular and genetic markers associated with this effect . It is our goal to provide an important insight into the nature of CAR after heart transplantation and its response to new anti-rejection drug Sirolimus . This information will have a significant impact on the treatment of heart transplant recipients and thus improve quality of life and prolong survival after heart transplantation .",2013-06-19,"June 30, 2023",Inclusion Criteria : All adult cardiac transplant recipients undergoing heart transplantation at UNMC/TNMC .

Generalized osteoporosis is common in RA , at axial and appendicular skeleton and in females and males . Denosumab is a fully humanized IgG monoclonal antibody that targets the receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand ( RANKL ) . Denosumab prevents the binding and activation of the RANK receptors on the osteoclasts and hence inhibits osteoclasts formation , activation , function and survival . Denosumab results in more rapid and greater reductions in bone remodeling and correspondingly greater increases in areal bone mineral density ( aBMD ) at all skeletal sites . Denosumab was approved by FDA in June 2010 for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk of fracture . Denosumab ( Prolia® ) is also licensed in Hong Kong . A high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography ( HR-pQCT ) capable of achieving an isotropic voxel size of 80μm at tolerable radiation doses ( 3μSv ) is available for the assessment of trabecular and cortical microarchitecture at the distal radius and tibia . This technique bears excellent precision for both density and microstructure measures . Denosumab 's greater potency in suppressing bone remodeling and greater effect on areal BMD than alendronate , particularly at predominantly cortical sites such as the distal third of the radius , may reflect the differing mechanism of action of these drugs , which , in turn , influence bone microarchitecture . The aim of this study is to compare the effects of denosumab and a current standard treatment on cortical and trabecular microarchitecture at the radius and second metacarpal in RA patients with low bone mineral density using HR-pQCT during a 6-month open-label randomized controlled study .

It makes people feel hungry , and also is connected with the desire to drink alcohol . Researchers want to test ghrelin to see if it can be used to control alcohol cravings and use . They will compare doses of ghrelin with a placebo in people who drink heavily . Objectives : - To study the effects of ghrelin on alcohol craving and use . Eligibility : Individuals between 21 and 60 years of age who are heavy drinkers but are not seeking treatment for alcohol use . Participants must on average have more than 20 drinks per week for men , and more than 15 drinks per week for women . Design : Participants will have a screening visit , four 2-night study visits , and a follow-up visit . Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history . They will provide urine and breath samples for drug testing . They will also answer questions about mood and physical symptoms , and about alcohol and other cravings . At the study visits , participants will stay overnight at the National Institutes of Health clinical center . They will spend the night at the center , have tests on the next day , and go home on the following morning . At each visit , participants will receive a ghrelin or placebo infusion , and will complete a series of tasks . For the first and second study visits , participants will have tests of alcohol craving and use . They will be able to receive alcohol infusions through a computer program that tests response time and craving reactions . At the same time , they will have a ghrelin or a placebo infusion . Blood alcohol levels , reaction time , and craving will be studied . For the third and fourth study visits , participants will have a magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) study . They will have an initial MRI to provide a picture of the brain . They will then have a functional MRI during which they will respond to a computer test . The test will allow them to win points for snack food or alcohol . This test will look at the brain s response time and craving reactions . There will be a follow-up visit 1 week after the fourth study visit . Some of the tests from the screening visit will be repeated .","Objective : Ghrelin is a 28-amino acid peptide acting as the endogenous ligand for the growth hormone secretagogue receptor ( GHS-R ) . Ghrelin stimulates appetite by acting on the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus ( ARC ) , a region that controls the intake of food and other substances , including alcohol . In addition to the ARC , GHS receptors ( GHS-Rs ) are also highly expressed in the caudal brain stem , the ventral tegmental area ( VTA ) , hippocampus , substantia nigra , and dorsal and medial raphe nuclei . The expression of the GHS-R in the mesolimbic dopamine ( DA ) pathway suggests that ghrelin could play a role in reward processing . The role of ghrelin in the DA reward processing and the role of the DA reward system in alcoholism suggest a role of ghrelin in alcoholism . Consistent with this hypothesis , preclinical studies demonstrate that both ghrelin and ethanol activate the cholinergic-dopaminergic reward link , implying neurochemical analogies between ghrelin and ethanol . This supports the hypothesis that ghrelin is involved in mediating the rewarding properties of ethanol . Additional animal experiments demonstrate that the central ghrelin action not only stimulates the reward processing but is also required for stimulation of that system by alcohol . Human studies show reduced ghrelin levels in actively drinking alcoholics ; increased ghrelin levels during alcohol abstinence ; and a positive correlation between ghrelin level and alcohol craving scores . More recently , a study conducted at Brown University by the PI demonstrated the safety of the administration IV of human ghrelin to non-treatment seeking alcohol-dependent heavy drinking individuals . Furthermore , a preliminary interim analysis shows that IV ghrelin administration may lead to a temporary significant increase in alcohol craving . The primary objective of this protocol is to investigate whether IV ghrelin , as compared to placebo , will increase motivation for alcohol reward , as measured by a progressive ratio ( PR ) schedule paradigm with IV alcohol self-infusion ( primary aim ) . We will also assess a number of secondary aims . Specifically , we will also assess whether IV ghrelin , as compared to placebo , will also alter urges to drink and the subjective response to IV alcohol . Adverse events will also be assessed to ensure the safety of the IV coadministration of ghrelin and alcohol . During an fMRI/alcohol clamp session , fMRI will be used to see whether ghrelin affects the activation of the ventral striatum induced by acute IV alcohol administration and the incentive salience of cues associated with alcohol administration . Study Population : Male and female participants will be non-treatment seeking heavy drinking volunteers . Design : The study is designed as a within-subject , double-blind , placebo-controlled study of ghrelin . The first visit will be the initial screening visit . The second and third visits will be PR sessions with IV ethanol , during which each participant will also receive IV ghrelin ( or matched placebo ) . The fourth and fifth visits will combine an fMRI session with an alcohol clamp session ( i.e . a fixed dose of alcohol will be administered ) and subjects will participate in a modified version of the monetary incentive delay ( MID ) task in which they will respond to cues that indicate the opportunity to press a button to gain a reward . On some trials the reward will be points that can be exchanged for snack foods while on other trials the reward will be points that will determine how much intravenous alcohol a subject will be given during the alcohol clamp procedure which will immediately follow the modified MID task . After the modified MID task is complete subjects will have a short break and then begin the alcohol IV infusion . Outcome measures : The primary measure of this study will be the breakpoint , which is the schedule ( number of button presses ) at which the individual stops to work for more alcohol . Also , the BrAC exposure measures will be determined . Alcohol craving in response to ghrelin will be measured using the Alcohol Visual Analogue Scale ( A-VAS ) and the Alcohol Urge Questionnaire ( AUQ ) during the PR sessions . Sensitivity to alcohol will be measured using the Drug Effects Questionnaire ( DEQ ) , Biphasic Alcohol Effects Scale ( BAES ) , and the Profile of Mood States ( POMS ) , repeatedly during the PR sessions and the CASE Experience Questionnaire ( CEQ ) at the end of all sessions . fMRI BOLD signal in brain areas associated with incentive salience and areas associated with reward circuitry ( including the ventral striatum ) will be measured during the fMRI/alcohol clamp session . This study may facilitate the identification of a novel neuropharmacological target , thus facilitating the development of novel pharmacological treatments for alcoholism .",2013-01-24,"July 5, 2018","INCLUSION CRITERIA : Male and female participants between 21-60 years of age .

National Institutes of Health Clinical Center (CC),NCT01778556,Short-term Effects of Leptin in People With Lipodystrophy,National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK),2,1,Lipodystrophy,Biological,Metreleptin,Treatment,,"Background : - Lipodystrophy is a condition where people do not have enough fat in the body . People with lipodystrophy can have problems such as diabetes or an enlarged liver . Researchers are looking at how leptin , a hormone produced by fat cells , can help people with these problems . Leptin helps control appetite and how the body stores food . Taking leptin can help people with lipodystrophy eat less food , which may help treat diabetes and other problems . To better understand how leptin works , researchers want to do an inpatient study on leptin treatment in people with lipodystrophy . Objectives : - To study how leptin treatment affects lipodystrophy . Eligibility : - Individuals between 14 and 70 years of age who have lipodystrophy . Design : All participants will have a 19-day stay at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center . One group of participants will have tests for 5 days before starting to take leptin . They will then take leptin for 2 weeks , and have more tests . The other group of participants will have tests for 5 days while taking leptin . They will then take stop taking leptin for 2 weeks , and have more tests , and then they will start taking leptin again . Participants will have regular blood and urine tests during the visit . Some of the blood tests will look at insulin levels . Some will look at how the body metabolizes sugar and fat . Other tests will check hormone levels , especially of reproductive hormones . During the visit , participants will spend 3 separate days in a metabolic chamber , a special room that measures how many calories the body uses . Urine samples will be collected during these stays . Participants will also have several body imaging studies , including magnetic resonance imaging and a body composition scan . Physical activity will be tested with an exercise bicycle and an electronic activity monitor . Participants will be asked questions about hunger and comfort levels throughout the stay .","Background Leptin is an adipocyte-derived hormone that can be thought of as a signal from adipose tissue to the rest of the body conveying information about long-term nutritional status . Patients with lipodystrophy have leptin deficiency secondary to lack of adipose tissue , and thus represent a natural model for studying the effects of leptin deficiency and replacement in humans . Leptin replacement in lipodystrophy ameliorates metabolic and endocrine abnormalities , including reducing food intake , improving insulin resistance and diabetes , reducing ectopic lipid , and normalizing reproduction . The reduction in energy intake induced by leptin replacement is likely responsible for part of the improvements observed in glucose and lipid metabolism . The clinical effects of leptin that are independent of changes in energy intake , and the mechanisms underlying these effects , have been poorly explored in humans . Aim The primary aim of this study is to determine the energy intake-independent effects of leptin on energy metabolism in lipodystrophic subjects . The major aspects of energy metabolism to be studied are : Lipid metabolism , including fasting lipids , lipolysis and fatty acid turnover , and ectopic lipid storage . Glucose metabolism , including fasting glucose , endogenous glucose production , and insulin sensitivity Energy expenditure , including total and resting energy expenditure , skeletal muscle work efficiency , and spontaneous physical activity In addition , the effects of leptin on endocrine and autonomic function will be examined , including effects on the thyroid , gonadal , and adrenal axes , as well as blood pressure , body temperature , and heart rate variability . Methods This is a non-randomized , parallel group study . Two groups of patients aged 14 to 70 years with lipodystrophy will be studied : leptin naive and leptin treated . Minors will only be included in the leptin naive arm . All subjects will be stabilized on a weight maintenance diet for 5 days ( Period 1 ) . After this , leptin will be withdrawn from leptin treated subjects , and leptin will be initiated in leptin naive subjects for a period of 14 days ( Period 2 ) . The same isocaloric diet will be continued throughout both Periods , permitting study of leptin s effects independent of energy intake . All subjects will undergo metabolic testing on admission , at the end of Period 1 , and throughout Period 2 , to generate a detailed short-term time course of the effects of leptin initiation or withdrawal . At the end of Period 2 , leptin will be continued in the leptin naive subjects , and restarted in the leptin treated subjects . Repeat metabolic testing will be performed 6-12 months after leptin initiation in the leptin-naive cohort to generate information on leptin s long-term effects .",2013-01-26,"October 21, 2019","INCLUSION CRITERIA : Age 14-70 years ( children under age 18 will only be enrolled in the leptin-naive arm of the study Clinically-significant lipodystrophy as defined in protocol 02-DK-0022 ( Long Term Efficacy of Leptin Replacement in the Treatment of Lipodystrophy ) .

Amputation is often preceded by a chronic ulceration . The incidence of diabetic ulcers is approximately 6 % over a 3 year period [ 1 ] . Diabetic foot ulcerations are particularly challenging to heal due to a host of factors including vascular compromise , peripheral neuropathy , and begin prone to infection . Therefore , strategies to heal these wounds as quickly as possible are of paramount importance . Current strategies for chronic wound healing are limited to topical ointments/therapies , allografts/xenografts with or without cell impregnation , dressings , and wound healing devices . None of these current modalities have been shown to be clearly more effective than another [ 3,4 ] . Currently , oral medications have not been examined for healing of these chronic ulcerations . Particularly , antihyperglycemic medications have not been studied specifically for the purpose of wound healing . Glucose control and wound healing have been shown to be related [ 5-7 ] . However , it is thought that wound healing as a result of tighter glucose control is merely a global effect rather than a direct result of the medications utilized with no evidence that indicates that a specific antihyperglycemic medication works better than another . Further , the mechanism of how and why this relationship exists is not well understood . Specifically , how the microenvironment of the wound as evidenced by changes in the biomarkers has not been delineated . Januvia ( sitagliptin ) is an FDA approved antihyperglycemic drug that inhibits the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase 4 ( DPP-4 ) , which is an enzyme that is responsible for the breakdown of glucagon-like peptide ( GLP-1 ) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide ( GIP ) . By blocking this effect , GLP-1 and GIP stimulates the secretion of insulin and suppresses the release of glucagon thereby normalizing blood glucose . The unique properties of this drug decrease the likelihood of hypoglycemia . Therefore , this drug is often used in combination of other antihyperglycemic medications to produce a synergistic effect . DPP4 is expressed on the membranes of a variety of cell types as well as in soluble form , and cleaves the two N-terminal amino acids , X-ala or X-pro , from a limited number of peptide substrates , usually resulting in their inactivation . A family of DPP4 inhibitors , gliptins , have been shown to preserve the full-length active forms of GLP1 and GIP in patients with type II diabetes , enhancing antihyperglycemic activity . In addition to GLP1 and GIP , important substrates of DPP4 essential for wound healing , and altered in diabetes , include SDF-1α/β ( stromal cell derived factor 1 ) , PYY ( peptide YY ) , NPY ( neuropeptide Y ) , GM-CSF ( granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor ) , G-CSF ( granulocyte colony stimulating factor ) , and IL3 ( interleukin 3 ) [ 8-12 ] . SDF , PYY , and NPY are all important for angiogenesis , while GM-CSF , G-CSF , and IL3 are necessary for leukocyte proliferation and infiltration in the wound bed . The observation that DPP4 can cleave and inactive all of these signaling molecules in vivo suggest that modulation of DPP4 activity will have a direct effect on wound healing . The prospect that a daily oral medication that improves overall glucose control of a diabetic patient as well as expediting the wound healing process is profound . This study explores this possibility . This is a prospective , randomized study examining the ability of sitagliptin in expediting the wound healing process in the diabetic patient with a chronic foot wound . This is a single center study of 250 total subjects randomized into 2 arms . It is projected that this study will take 3 years to complete . The two arms will be 1 ) Januvia ( sitagliptin ) 100mg q day * and 2 ) placebo-control q day . Patients with Type II diabetes with a chronic foot ulcer will be enrolled into this study . Each subject will be randomized into one of the two arms and will participate in the study for a maximum of 16 weeks . At the end of 16 weeks subjects will be exited from the study . If at any time during the course of the study the wound heals , the subject will be exited from the study after a 2-week confirmatory visit . * For moderate renal failure subjects , the sitagliptin dose will be adjusted to 50mg q day .",2013-12-13,"November 8, 2016","Inclusion Criteria : Male or female age > 18 Type II Diabetes with glycated hemoglobin ( hemoglobin A1C ) of < 11 Currently on an oral hyperglycemic medication other than sitagliptin A chronic wound defined as the lack of wound healing progress of 0.80 Wound located on the foot or ankle ( Wagner Grade 1,2 ) Able to comply with the requirements of the research trial Exclusion Criteria : Current use of dipeptidyl-peptidase four ( DPP-4 ) inhibitor or glucagon like peptide one ( GLP-1 ) agonist End stage renal disease Currently enrolled in another research trial that involves treatment of the wound Active infection of the wound Wound that probes to bone with osteomyelitis ( Wagner Grade 3 )",1,0,18 Years,80 Years

In the pilot phase subjects will be randomized into three treatment groups of allogenic mesenchymal stem cells and in the randomized phase subjects will receive either allogenic mesenchymal stem cells or matched placebo .","Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis ( IPF ) is a progressive and debilitating lung disease characterized by interstitial fibrosis with decreasing lung volumes and pulmonary insufficiency eventually resulting in death . Patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis ( IPF ) typically present with complaints of sub acutely progressive dyspnea and non-productive cough , often accompanied by digital clubbing . Due to the insidious onset of symptoms , however , most patients are diagnosed at late stages of the disease after significant fibrosis has occurred . Physical exam is characterized by hypoxemia , `` dry '' inspiratory crackles on auscultation , and occasional digital clubbing ( 6 ) . Pulmonary function tests ( PFTs ) usually reveal restrictive lung physiology with progressive decline of forced vital capacity ( FVC ) , diffusion capacity ( DLCO ) and six-minute walk distances . Diagnosis is established by the pathologic finding of usual interstitial pneumonia ( with sub epithelial fibroblastic foci ) by open lung biopsy ( 7 ) , and/or by high resolution CT ( HRCT ) demonstrating the characteristic findings of peripheral/basal sub pleural reticulonodular changes with fibrosis , honeycombing , and traction bronchiectasis ( 8 , 9 ) . The prognosis for patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis ( IPF ) is uniformly poor . The natural history of the disease is characterized by inexorable progressive decline interspersed with `` exacerbations '' or periods of accelerated disease which are often fatal ( 5 ) . There are no FDA approved treatment options for patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis ( IPF ) and thus no standard of care . In cases of patients under the age of 60 with limited comorbid disease , lung transplant may be offered . Patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis ( IPF ) receive empiric treatment , supportive care alone , and more recently , are offered enrollment in clinical trials . The pathogenesis of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis ( IPF ) is characterized by epithelial cell injury and activation with interstitial inflammation , fibroblast proliferation with extracellular matrix collagen deposition , and eventual loss of function . Because mesenchymal stem cells are known to home to sites of injury , inhibit inflammation , and contribute to epithelial tissue repair , their use has been suggested as a novel therapy for the treatment of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis ( IPF ) .",2013-12-02,"March 5, 2021","Inclusion Criteria : Provide written informed consent .

There are moderate pain complaints after herniorrhaphy . Besides causing discomfort to the patients , pain , can delay recovery and discharge and cause cognitive dysfunction and difficulty with returning to normal daily activity . A combination of analgesics with different effect sites can reduce the doses needed and analgesic related side effects which is called multimodal analgesia . Opioids , acetaminophen , nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drugs and cox-2 inhibitors , alfa-2 receptor agonists , steroids , gabapentin and pregabalin have been used for this purpose ( 4 ) . Tizanidine is an alfa-2 receptor agonist , and is used for musculoskeletal pain conditions . Tizanidine reduced the local anesthetic requirement in spinal anesthesia .

Sri Hasanamba Dental College and Hospital,NCT02016157,Moxifloxacin in Situ Gel to Treat Periodontal Pocket.,Sri Hasanamba Dental College and Hospital,4,1,Chronic Generalized Periodontitis,Drug,Moxifloxacin,Treatment,,In this Randomized clinical trial locally delivered moxifloxacin in situ gel was evaluated as an adjunct to scaling and root planing for efficacy in the treatment of chronic periodontitis and for short-term effects on the periodontal microflora .,"Moxifloxacin exerts excellent antibacterial activity against a wide range of putative periodontal pathogens , including Porphyromonas gingivalis , Tannerella forsythia , Prevotella species , Fusobacterium nucleatum , Actinomyces species , Peptostreptococcus species , Campylobacter rectus , and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans . Moxifloxacin penetrates well into soft tissues and is effective against intracellular periodontal pathogens when used in the treatment of periodontitis as an adjunct to scaling and root planning ( SRP ) . Systemic administration of moxifloxacin has provided superior outcomes compared with SRP in conjunction with systemic administration of doxycycline , or SRP alone . We hypothesized similar benefits with local drug delivery of Moxifloxacin in the treatment of chronic periodontitis . To the best of our knowledge , there is no published literature on in situ gel using moxifloxacin employing gellan gum as the vehicle , for direct placement in the periodontal pocket for the treatment of chronic periodontitis . Among various drug delivery systems for treating periodontitis , gel formulations have some advantages . Despite a relatively faster release of the drug , gels can be more easily prepared and administered . Moreover , they possess a higher bio compatibility and bio adhesivity , by allowing adhesion to the mucosa in the dental pocket and by decreasing the risk of dilution of the material by saliva . Keeping the above facts in mind , the goals of this study were to ( 1 ) evaluate in situ gel as a vehicle in a local drug delivery system , ( 2 ) evaluate the efficacy of moxifloxacin for local drug delivery , ( 3 ) evaluate the efficacy of gellan gum for in situ gelation of moxifloxacin , and ( 4 ) evaluate and compare the clinical and microbiological parameters of moxifloxacin with those of the gold standard , chlorhexidine di gluconate .",2013-11-06,"August 10, 2020",Inclusion Criteria : patients with good systemic health Patients with Chronic periodontitis with sites with probing pocket depth ( PPD ) of ≥ 5 mm a minimum of 12 natural teeth with radiographic evidence of bone loss willingness to comply with the study protocol .

National Institutes of Health Clinical Center (CC),NCT02015065,Phase II Trial of Vandetanib in Children and Adults With Wild-Type Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors,National Cancer Institute (NCI),2,1,GIST,Drug,Vandetanib,Treatment,,"Background : -Some people with wild-type gastrointestinal stromal tumors ( WT-GIST ) have a deficiency in one of their proteins called succinate dehydrogenase ( SDH ) . Vandetanib is a cancer drug that has been approved to treat thyroid cancer and has been used with some success in other tumors that have a similar loss of SDH . Researchers want to see if this drug can also decrease tumor growth in people with WT-GIST . Objectives : -To test whether the study drug will benefit people with WT-GIST . Eligibility : -Adults and children 3 years old and older with WT-GIST . Design : Researchers will test participants tumor tissue to confirm it is the wild type of GIST . Participants will be screened with a medical history , physical exam , and blood tests . They will also have electrical recording of the heart ( Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) ) and scans of the tumor . Participants will take the study drug in 28-day cycles . Their doctor will decide how many cycles they can complete . They will take the study drug once every day and record it in a diary . On Day 14 , they will also visit their doctor to look for side effects . Before cycles 2 , 3 and 4 , participants will have a physical exam , urine tests , blood pressure check , and blood tests . These tests will then be done periodically for as long as they are in the study . Before cycle 4 , scans will be done to check the size of the cancer . Most of these will be repeated every 3-6 cycles . When they stop taking the study drug , participants will return to the clinic for a physical exam and blood tests .","Background : Gastrointestinal stromal tumors ( GISTs ) are the most common mesenchymal tumor of the gastrointestinal tract , resistant to cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiation therapy . KIT and platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha ( PDGFRA ) mutations have been identified as tumor initiating events in 85 % of adult patients with GIST , but 85 % of GISTs in pediatric patients lack KIT and PDGFRA mutations ( wild-type ) and imatinib is not as effective in eliciting objective responses . Recent work in the Pediatric and Wild-Type ( wt ) GIST Clinic at the National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) led to the identification of succinate dehydrogenase ( SDH ) germline mutations in 12 % patients with wt-GIST ( 6/34 ) . SDH protein expression evaluated using immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) was markedly decreased or absent in 18/18 patients with pediatric wt-GIST . Thus the majority of wt-GIST are SDH-deficient . Vandetanib ( ZACTIMA ; ZD6474 ; AstraZeneca ) is an oral small molecule antineoplastic drug that inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 ( VEGFR2 ) , estimated glomerular filtration rate ( EGFR ) , and rearranged during transfection ( RET ) -dependent signaling . Preliminary preclinical data demonstrate marked growth inhibition of SDH-mutant/deficient renal cell carcinoma cell lines when treated with vandetanib . Objective ( s ) : -Primary : To assess the clinical activity ( radiographic response Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors ( RECIST v1.1 ) of vandetanib in children and adults with wt-GIST using RECIST ( v1.1 ) . Eligibility : -Adults and children with measurable localized or metastatic wt-GIST confirmed in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments ( CLIA ) laboratory will be eligible for trial participation . Patients must have measurable disease by RECISTv1.1 and adequate organ function . Design : This phase II trial will determine whether daily oral vandetanib is active in patients with wt-GIST . Vandetanib activity will be assessed primarily by radiographic response of measurable disease using RECISTv1.1 . Vandetanib will be administered orally once daily continuously in the absence of toxicity or disease progression , using a 28-day cycle . Patients will be carefully monitored for toxicity and response . A small , optimal two-stage phase II design with a target response rate of 25 % will be used . Nine evaluable patients will be enrolled initially . If 1 or more of the first 9 have a response , then accrual would continue until a total of 24 patients have enrolled . If there are 3 or more responses in 24 ( 12.5 % or more ) patients , then this would be sufficiently interesting activity to warrant further study .",2013-12-14,"March 25, 2020","-INCLUSION CRITERIA Age : -greater than or equal to 3 years of age and Body Surface Area ( BSA ) greater than or equal to 0.5 m ( 2 ) Diagnosis Histologically or cytologically confirmed Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors ( GIST ) by the Laboratory of Pathology , National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) .

The immune system can target these to attack the cancer . The PANVAC vaccine puts genes for these proteins inside a virus vaccine so the body sees the proteins as foreign invaders and attacks them . Researchers will test PANVAC on people with high grade non-muscle invasive bladder cancer . They will give it to people who have not responded to the usual treatment , bacillus Calmette-Guerin ( BCG ) over several weeks . They want to see if PANVAC plus BCG is better than BCG alone . Objective : - To compare the effects of PANVAC plus BCG therapy , to BCG therapy alone . Eligibility : - Adults 18 and older with high grade non-muscle invasive bladder cancer who failed at least 1 course of BCG . Design : Participants will be screened with blood and urine tests and abdominal scans . Participants will be randomly assigned to get BCG only or BCG plus PANVAC . They will have up to 10 visits over 15 weeks . Most of these are part of usual cancer care . They will have blood and urine tests . All participants will get BCG in 6 weekly injections . One group will also get PANVAC in 5 injections over 15 weeks . Between weeks 17 and 20 , participants will undergo tests of the tumor area as part of their usual care . They will have cystoscopy , exam under anesthesia , and bladder biopsy . Results will be used to evaluate the different treatments . Participants will have quarterly follow-up visits for up to 2 years .","Background : High grade ( G3 ) non-muscle invasive urothelial carcinoma of the bladder ( stages Ta , T1 , and carcinoma in situ ( CIS ) has a high rate of recurrence and progression The standard of care therapeutic agent is a single induction course of bacillus Calmette- Guerin ( BCG ) Although a second induction course can be used in patients who fail a single induction course of BCG , only 35 % of patients who failed an initial induction course will experience 12 month disease-free survival after receiving a second induction course For those patients failing a second induction course , radical cystectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy is the recommended treatment , although it has a high morbidity rate and a small but real mortality rate Therefore , there is an unmet need for localized treatment for patients who fail an initial induction course of BCG that can potentially improve upon the poor results of a second induction course of BCG Recently , a unique pox viral vector-based vaccine , PANVAC , has been shown to induce a cluster of differentiation 4 ( CD4 ) and cluster of differentiation 8 ( CD8 ) antigen-specific immune response against the tumor-associated antigens ( TAAs ) , carcinoembryonic antigen ( CEA ) and mucin-1 ( MUC-1 ) . This vaccine also contains transgenes for three human T cell co-stimulatory molecules that can potentially augment an immune response We hypothesize that the combined administration of BCG and PANVAC may augment the BCG-induced cytotoxic T lymphocyte response against bladder cancer cells expressing MUC-1 and/or CEA and potentially reverse BCG failure in patients that have failed one induction course of BCG Objectives : -To determine if there is an improvement in disease-free survival ( DFS ) with BCG + PANVAC compared with BCG alone in a phase II study in non-muscle invasive high-grade urothelial carcinoma of the bladder who have failed to respond to intravesical BCG within 1 year post treatment .

University of Florida,NCT02012647,Subthalamic Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) in Parkinson's Disease,University of Florida,0,1,Parkinson's Disease,Procedure,Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS),Other,,"The purpose of this study is to examine the brain changes in people with Parkinson 's Disease ( PD ) after they get deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) surgery , compared with people who do not have Parkinson 's Disease . Treatment of Parkinson 's disease is often difficult and challenging . Deep brain stimulation is an established surgical treatment that is effective for the treatment of PD , but the details of why it helps are not known . In order to achieve maximum benefits from this treatment , it is important to understand how it changes the brain . Specifically , the investigators will study electrophysiology , which is the study of how the brain conducts electrical messages to the rest of the body . To do this , the investigators will use transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) , which is a painless and non-invasive procedure . They will also conduct motor physiology experiments of the upper and lower limbs to collect data about skeletal muscle movement . The data from this study will help explain whether the electrical changes in the brain have any relation to the physical benefits patients with Parkinson 's Disease sometimes receive from DBS surgery .","Screening evaluation : The Investigators will ask questions to see if the participant qualifies to be in the study . The screening visit will occur up to 4 months before the first study visit , and can be scheduled to occur on the same day as the first study visit . This evaluation will include a review of medical history and clinical findings related to Parkinson 's Disease ( if applicable ) . There may be a neurological exam ( physical exam ) . Women of child bearing potential will take a urine pregnancy test . If applicable , the medications currently used to treat Parkinson 's Disease symptoms will be reviewed and subjects will be asked to discontinue them for some hours on the days of the study visits . The investigators do not expect concerns or unwanted consequences arising either from discontinuing the Parkinson 's Disease medications or turning off the DBS stimulator for the duration of time proposed in the study . Participants will be studied under 4 conditions , over a span of as few as two days to as long as two months . The four Conditions are : 1 ) The DBS stimulator will be turned OFF for both sides . 2 ) The DBS stimulator will be turned ON for the right side . 3 ) The DBS stimulator will be turned ON for the left side . 4 ) The DBS stimulator will be turned ON for both sides . The order of these conditions will be picked randomly . Participants will be asked not to take PD medications for approximately 12 hours prior to the scheduled visit time , and until after the physiological testing . Healthy controls will be studied on only one occasion , as they do not have DBS . Tests performed for each study condition : Parkinson 's Participants Only : A neurological examination will be performed by administering several clinical scaled . These clinical scales include the Unified Parkinson 's Disease Rating Scale ( UPDRS ) , the self-report Parkinson 's Disease Quality of life scale ( PDQ-39 ) , MMSE instrument for cognitive ( or memory ) testing , and Beck Depression Inventory ( BDI II ) for evaluation of mood and depressive symptoms . The PDQ-39 , MMSE , and BDI will each only be administered once and therefore will not be repeated at every study visit . The investigators will determine individual motor evoked potential ( MEP ) thresholds before beginning the study treatment . MEP will be recorded from a muscle located between the right thumb and index finger , and then from the left thumb and index finger . MEP threshold refers to the amount of stimulation to the brain that is required to activate muscle cells enough to appear on an electromyography ( EMG ) , which records electrical potential in muscle through electrodes placed on the skin . The investigators will use TMS to test motor cortex functions . For these tests , participants will sit in a chair that looks like the one at the dentist 's office . A magnetic coil will be placed on the scalp on one side of the head , overlying the brain 's motor cortex to stimulate the brain 's output to the muscles in the opposite hand . A second magnetic coil will be placed on the scalp of opposite side . Recordings from both hands will be made using the magnetic coils placed on scalp . The investigators will collect data about the muscles of both the upper and lower limbs with a wireless EMG procedure . To do this , small wireless sensors will be placed on the skin over both arm and leg muscles . Participants will be asked to sit in a chair and perform movements with the upper and lower limbs while the EMG records measurements about movement activity . This procedure will be conducted separately for the upper and lower limbs . Participants who have provided consent will be videotaped during the visits . Side effects and adverse events pertaining to this study will be recorded at each visit .",2013-11-01,"September 8, 2020",Inclusion Criteria : Aged 18-80 years Diagnosis of Parkinson 's Disease with bilateral subthalamic nucleus ( STN ) DBS Exclusion Criteria : Cardiac pacemakers Need for diathermy Repeat MRI scanning Anticoagulant therapy Previous neuro surgical procedure or ablative therapy Frank dementia according to cognitive screening History of seizures Pregnancy Presence of a terminal illness,4,0,18 Years,80 Years

However , due to a lack of suitable donors , many patients can not benefit from this strategy . Alternative donor sources are desperately needed to fill this gap . Nearly all patients will have a haploidentical family member who would be able to donate . The use of post transplantation cyclophosphamide has greatly improved the outcome of haploidentical stem cell transplantation . The investigators propose to combine this with alemtuzumab/TBI conditioning .","Sickle cell anemia is an inherited form of anemia , a condition in which there are n't enough healthy red blood cells to carry adequate oxygen throughout the body . These patients are at increased risk of death , stroke , frequent pain crises , acute chest syndrome as well as chronic conditions including : lung damage , retinopathy , kidney damage , leg ulcers , and pulmonary hypertension . There 's no cure for most people with sickle cell anemia . However , treatments can relieve pain and help prevent co-morbid conditions associated with sickle cell anemia . Hydroxyurea is the only FDA approved drug to help alleviate symptoms associated with sickle cell disease . The mortality rate is still high in patients using hydroxyurea and a significant percentage of patients still have aggressive disease despite the hydroxyurea treatment . Hydroxyurea therapy also does not seem to prevent the development of many of the complications of sickle cell disease such as pulmonary hypertension . Historically , stem cell transplantation in sickle cell disease was mainly done in the pediatric population . The options were more limited for adults with sickle cell disease with aggressive disease despite hydroxyurea . Most rely on chronic red blood cell transfusions which carry significant risks of infection , iron overload , and alloimmunization . Alloimmunization refers to the production of antibodies which occurs in up to 50 % of patients with sickle cell disease who are on chronic transfusion therapy making further transfusions difficult with a high potential for hemolytic transfusion reactions . Recently the use of a non-myeloablative stem cell transplantation regimen ( relying on immunotherapy instead of chemotherapy ) for sickle cell disease in adults showed 88 % engraftment rates ( 30 out of 34 patients ) with no GVHD and 0 % mortality . However , these transplants used only fully HLA-matched siblings , which are unavailable to all but approximately 14-28 % of patients who could benefit from such a transplant at UIC . A recent study at Johns Hopkins carried out a similar haploidentical ( half matched ) transplant with 14 sickle cell patients who lacked fully HLA-matched donors . Approximately two years following transplant , 57 % of patients successfully engrafted ( 8 or 14 patients ) . There were no deaths and only one episode of acute GVHD of the skin which resolved without therapy . The investigators plan to offer stem cell transplantation to sickle cell patients with aggressive disease who only have a partially matched HLA sibling donor . Haploidentical transplants are considered only for patients with no other standard options available who would normally be treated with supportive ( palliative ) care or given the option to participate in a clinical trial . Donors who are HLA-haploidentical will be the source of hematopoietic stem cells . Potential donors can include any relative ( e.g . parents , offspring , siblings , cousins , aunts/uncles , grandparents ) . The related donor stem cell transplantation using the alemtuzumab/TBI platform has been shown to be a safe strategy to cure severe sickle cell disease . However , due to a lack of suitable donors , many patients can not benefit from this strategy . Alternative donor sources are desperately needed to fill this gap . Nearly all patients will have a haploidentical family member who would be able to donate . The use of post transplantation cyclophosphamide has greatly improved the outcome of haploidentical stem cell transplantation .

Massachusetts General Hospital,NCT02003625,Meloxicam vs Placebo for Mobilization,Massachusetts General Hospital,2,1,Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma,Drug,GCSF,Treatment,Single,"This research study is evaluating a drug called meloxicam to see if it provides a benefit to people receiving Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation ( AHSCT ) . The participant is currently scheduled to receive an AHSCT , which is a procedure that removes blood-forming stem cells ( cells from which all blood cells develop ) from the body . These stem cells are stored and later given back to the participant by a process called apheresis . This is a standard procedure to treat certain blood diseases such as lymphoma and multiple myeloma . However the use of meloxicam with this procedure is considered investigational . Meloxicam is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAID ) which is given to decrease fever , swelling and pain that may come with inflammation . It has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of arthritis however it has not been approved for use in people receiving AHSCT . This study will compare the combination of meloxicam with a drug called G-CSF ( also called neupogen ) , to the combination of G-CSF with an agent that has no medicine ( placebo ) . G-CSF is a substance that causes blood stem cells to change or increase in number when given to people undergoing AHSCT . The researchers would like to learn if giving meloxicam in combination with G-CSF to people before they undergo AHSCT will increase the number of stem cells available in the blood to collect and make the collection process easier .","After the screening procedures confirm that the participant is eligible to participate in the research study : Because no one knows which of the study options is best , the participant will be `` randomized '' into one of the study groups : G-CSF with meloxicam G-CSF with placebo ( pills with no medicine ) Randomization means that the participants are put into a group by chance .

This is a proof-of-concept study . The PIE study will set the stage for novel therapy to modify the course of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) . COPD is the third leading cause of death in the United States . No currently available treatment can meaningfully restore lung function that is lost in this disease . Emphysema is a major component of COPD and results when lung damage exceeds the ability of the lung to repair . Recent evidence indicates that the repair processes present in the normal lung are deficient in patients with emphysema and that this is due , in part , to suppression of repair by an inflammatory mediator : prostaglandin E ( PGE ) . Currently available therapies can block PGE production , but whether this can be achieved in the lung in COPD is unknown . The PIE study will answer that question . This will be accomplished by performing a randomized , double blind , placebo-controlled , parallel group study that will compare a widely used and well-tolerated non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug , ibuprofen 600 mg three times daily , with placebo . PGE will be measured directly in the lower respiratory tract by sampling the lung with the technique of bronchoalveolar lavage . Secondary measures will be made , quantifying PGE in induced sputum and quantifying PGE metabolites in blood and urine . In addition , the current proposal will determine if biochemical measures of lung repair are restored by treatments that block PGE production . Additional outcomes will also be assessed including the effect of treatment on PGD and other eicosanoids and assessing IL-8 and neutrophils in sputum and BAL fluid and selected inflammatory biomarkers present in serum that may be associated with lung function decline . Finally , in an accompanying Ancillary Study , the current proposal will determine if alveolar macrophages over-produce PGE and/or PGD in COPD and will determine if the microRNA miR-146a modulates the production of these prostaglandins , as we have demonstrated for lung fibroblasts . The Ancillary Study will also determine if genetic variation in a miR-146a is related to differential expression . The proposed research will , therefore , determine if inhibition of PGE production can be achieved in the lung , if this appears to restore lung repair mechanisms and will help determine who would benefit from such a therapeutic approach . This is a highly novel approach to the treatment of emphysema and has the potential to restore lost lung function , a crucial unmet medical need for a major public health problem .",2013-12-04,"November 26, 2019","Inclusion Criteria : Age > 45 years Emphysema ( > 5 % of voxels 35 % predicted ) Smoker or ex-smoker ( 10 pack years minimum ) Exclusion Criteria : Contraindication to bronchoscopy or other study procedures Pregnancy of plans to become pregnant within six months Aspirin-sensitive asthma Regular use of systemic glucocorticoid Regular use of an NSAID ( low dose aspirin for cardiac disease is acceptable and subjects taking only this regularly will be eligible ) Unstable medical condition History of myocardial infarction or unstable angina within six months Allergy to or history of adverse effect from ibuprofen or other NSAID History of gastrointestinal bleeding within one year Any condition that , in the opinion of the investigator , places the subject at untoward risk Inability to provide informed consent",118,0,46 Years,80 Years

Singapore General Hospital,NCT02008981,Effect of Herbal Products on Platelet Function and Clotting,Singapore General Hospital,3,1,Platelet Function Test,Drug,Curcuma longa,Treatment,Quadruple,"This is a research study on the effect of some commonly used `` blood activating '' herbal products on platelet function and coagulation profile , ie whether it causes an increase in bleeding tendency , either used alone or in combination with Aspirin which is a commonly used anti-platelet drug .","This study is being conducted because there has not been any proper studies to provide evidence that these commonly used `` blood activating '' herbal preparations can in fact affect blood clotting by interfering with platelet function or clotting mechanism and potentiate the antiplatelet activity of Aspirin . These are assumptions based on TCM theory , laboratory experiments and animal studies but have led to the general statement in medical literature that these herbs increases bleeding risk in patients taking Aspirin or any other anti-platelet drugs . This has resulted in advice that these herbal products should not be taken by patients on Aspirin , which is a common drug taken by many patients . We hope to prove or disprove this theoretical concern by measurement of platelet and clotting function in healthy volunteers before and after taking the herbal product , alone and in combination with Aspirin . This will help to answer the question of whether it is safe for patients to take these common `` blood -activating `` herbs alone or together with Aspirin .

Federal University of Espirito Santo,NCT02004405,Heart Rate Variability in Fibromyalgia - Effects of Strengthening Exercises,Federal University of Espirito Santo,4,1,Fibromyalgia,Other,strengthening exercise,Treatment,Single,"Abstract Objective : Autonomic dysfunction is an important mechanism that could explain many symptoms observed in fibromyalgia ( FM ) . Exercise is an effective treatment , with benefits potentially mediated through changes in autonomic modulation . Strengthening is one of the less studied exercises in FM , and the acute and chronic effects of strengthening on the autonomic system remain unknown . The objective of this study is to assess the effects of strengthening exercises ( STRE ) on autonomic modulation , pain perception and the quality of life ( QOL ) of FM patients . Methods : Sedentary women with FM ( ACR 1990 ) will be randomly selected to STRE or flexibility ( FLEX ) exercises in a blind controlled trial . The intensity of STRE will be set at 45 % of the estimated load of 1 Repetition Maximum ( RM ) in 12 different exercises . The primary outcomes will be pain measured using the Visual Analog Scale ( VAS ) and the Heart Rate Variability ( HRV ) analysis . Other outcomes will be assess : fitness measured by treadmill test , the sit and reach test ( Wells and Dillon 's Bench ) , handgrip dynamometry ; and quality of life by the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire ( FIQ ) , the Beck and Idate Trait-State Inventory ( IDATE ) , a short-form health survey ( SF-36 ) . Statistical analyses and ethical procedures : The visual analog scale ( VAS ) for pain will be the primary measure used to determine sample size . Statistical significance will be set at 5 % and power of 80 % . These led to at least 58 participants to be randomized . The main hypothesis is that strengthening exercise is a better treatment than flexibility exercise to improve pain , HRV and quality of life . In all measures tested we will consider the null hypothesis ( H0 ) as being the point of equality between groups tested and H1 the point of difference . Bilateral tests were carried out adopting a 5 % level of significance . The normality of the results will be tested using the Shapiro-Wilk test . Student 's `` t '' -test for paired samples will be used to perform intra-group comparisons at different times , when the data were normally distributed , and the nonparametric equivalent of Student 's t-test ( Wilcoxon test ) will be used when the data show an asymmetrical distribution . To compare the data between the STRE and FLEX groups , ANOVA for repeated measures will be used , followed by post-hoc Bonferroni 's test .","STUDY PROTOCOL : The experimental group ( STRE ) will receive strengthening training in `` Station for lifting weight exercises '' ( Flex Mega 8 , Flex Fitness Equipment Brand ) using the recommendations of the American College of Sports Medicine ( ACMS , 2010 ) , twice a week , during 45 minutes for 16 weeks . The control group ( FLEX ) will receive stretching and flexibility exercise training according to the protocol of prescription and previously tested and described in appendix F ( Valim et al. , 2003 ) , twice a week , during 45 minutes for 16 weeks . The minimum number of patients per group will be 30 . The randomization will be by arriving order of the patients at the Clinic , having 2 groups with a distribution at random one by one . There will be an examiner for the selection and unblinded randomization and another for the application of tools that will be blind . Patients will undergo clinical and cardiological evaluation with an exercise stress test ( Ergometric test ) request in all of them according to ACMS as one more method of evaluation for inclusion and exclusion . The evaluation will be performed by a blind examiner , an expert physiotherapist in rheumatology and trained for the application of the tools at the beginning , after 30 , 60 , 90 , 120 days from the treatment onset . The measure for prescription and muscle strength gain will be by the method of maximal repetitions ( Lindh et al. , 1994 ; Tritschler , 2003 ; Brosseau et al. , 2008 ; ACSM , 2010 ) . The evaluations will take place at the beginning , 30 , 60 , 90 , 120 days ( final evaluation ) . Evaluations will be performed by the same blind examiner for the examined group . The training team will be formed by a physiotherapist , physical educator , and experienced doctors at strengthening training and flexibility and stretching exercises and they must follow the following protocol . PROTOCOL OF EXERCISES The strength training will be performed according to American College of Sports Medicine ( ACSM ) and will have a mild to moderate intensity representing 45 % of the estimated 1RM obtained from the maximal repetition method . Eight major muscle groups will be trained ( quadriceps femoris , hamstrings , biceps brachii , triceps brachii , pectoral , calf , deltoid , and latissimus dorsi ) in 12 different exercises , with 3 sets of 12 repetitions ( leg Press , leg extension , hip flexion , pectoral fly , triceps extension , shoulder flexion , leg curl , calf , pulldown , shoulder abduction , biceps flexion and shoulder extension ) . Theses 12 different exercises will be distributed in a composed circuit system of 2 sets of exercises : Set A ( ( leg Press , leg extension , hip flexion , pectoral fly , triceps extension , shoulder flexion ) and set B ( leg curl , calf , pulldown , shoulder abduction , biceps flexion and shoulder extension ) . Each set will be applied once a week alternatively . The exercises will be performed twice a week during 16 weeks . During the training process a load increase will be performed in order to seek progressive muscle strengthening improvement in a controlled way and according to patients ' clinical evolution . Blood pressure and heart rate will be monitored as well . Strength and strengthening training will be performed at the Evaluation , Physical Conditioning and Rehabilitation Laboratory ( LACORE ) at the University Hospital in in Federal University of Espirito Santo .

Postoperatively , these patients will often report pain in the back of the knee . Local anesthetic infiltration of the posterior aspect of the knee results in blockade of the genicular nerves of the posterior knee . These nerves originate off of the tibial and common peroneal nerves and their blockade will result in improved posterior knee pain relief and may decrease narcotic consumption compared to patients who receive the same infiltration with normal saline .","Femoral nerve blocks are commonly used to provide postoperative analgesia for ACL surgery . The limitation of these blocks is the incomplete analgesia they provide of the knee joint subjecting the patient to posterior knee pain . As a result , some of these patients receive rescue sciatic blocks in the postoperative care unit to cover posterior knee pain . The sciatic block provides excellent analgesia for the posterior knee ; however its blockade invariably affects other territories of the sciatic nerve such as the lower leg and foot . For ACL surgery , the loss of sensation and/or motor strength to this area is unnecessary and may make ambulation more difficult . The ability to ambulate with minimal assistance may be more important for a patient undergoing an outpatient surgery when compared to an inpatient surgery . At the posterior knee , the sciatic nerve branches off into the tibial and common peroneal nerves which give rise to sensory fibers that innervate the posterior knee . We propose targeting these terminal fibers in the popliteal fossa by infiltrating local anesthetic between the distal femoral shaft and popliteal artery thereby providing posterior knee analgesia without affecting the lower leg.This application of this block has not been studied in patients having ACL surgery . A single interim analysis is scheduled after the data for 50 cases are available .",2013-12-06,"March 8, 2017",Inclusion Criteria : patients who are presenting for ACL reconstruction candidates for peripheral nerve blocks patients ASA 1-3 Exclusion Criteria : Patient refusal ASA Classification of 4 or higher Pre-existing neuropathy in the femoral or sciatic distribution Coagulopathy Infection at the site Non-English speaking or non-reading patients Chronic opioid use ( > 3months ) Pregnancy Any other contra-indication to regional anesthesia Failed femoral nerve block Sciatic nerve block placed due to severe pain not managed by intravenous and oral agents .,18,0,18 Years,70 Years

They will have blood and urine tests and 7 scans . For most scans , a substance is injected through a tube in the arm . Participants will lie still on a table in a machine that takes images . Participants will have surgery to remove their tumor . Some will have surgery right away . Some will have surgery 6 months later , after 2 follow-up appointments . Participants will have 4 follow-up visits in the first year after surgery . They will have 2 visits the second year , then yearly visits for 3 years . At each follow-up visit , they will have scans and blood tests .","Background : Adrenal incidentalomas are common and found in approximately 4-7 % of the population . About 0.6 to 25 % of patients with an adrenal incidentaloma are found to have subclinical hypercortisolism : 2.3 % develop subclinical hypercortisolism during follow up and 0.6 % develop clinical hypercortisolism during follow up . Subclinical hypercortisolism is defined as biochemical excess of cortisol without signs and symptoms of overt hypercortisolism but may be associated with metabolic complications or disease progression and malignancy . Overt signs and symptoms of hypercortisolism include facial plethora , easy bruising , violaceous striae , and proximal muscle weakness . Several studies suggest that subclinical hypercortisolism may lead to long term consequences such as diabetes , hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , obesity , and osteoporosis . Thus , patients with subclinical hypercortisolism may benefit from operative intervention to halt or reverse metabolic complications associated with the disease and the risk of malignant progression . The optimal management of patients with subclinical hypercortisolism and adrenal incidentalomas is controversial and no large randomized trial has been conducted . We hypothesize that operative treatment would reduce the risk of long term complications of subclinical hypercortisolism and malignant progression , and propose a prospective randomized trial comparing nonoperative and operative management of subclinical hypercortisolism in patients with an adrenal neoplasm . Objectives : Primary Endpoints : -To determine whether unilateral adrenalectomy in patients diagnosed with subclinical hypercortisolism and adrenal neoplasm results in normalization and/or improvement of hypertension as assessed by reduction in pharmacotherapy and/or normalization of blood pressure ( systolic pressure < =140 and diastolic pressure < =90 ) , diabetes as assessed by reduction or elimination of pharmacotherapy and/or improvement in A1C to 3 mcgl/dL , elevated urine free cortisol , and/or morning adrenocorticotrophic hormone ( ACTH ) < 2.2 pmol/l ) without overt clinical signs and symptoms . Age greater than or equal to 18 years . Adults must be able to understand and sign the informed consent document . Patients must have laboratory and physical examination parameters within acceptable limits based on standard clinical practice . Design : Prospective randomized study comparing adrenalectomy versus observation . Patients assigned to the operative arm will undergo adrenalectomy and then followed postoperatively for normalization and/or improvement of metabolic complications associated with hypercortisolism and histologic examination of the resected tumor . Patients assigned to the non-operative arm will be monitored for possible complications associated with hypercortisolism for six months , at which point they will cross-over to the operative intervention arm . Patients with bilateral adrenal neoplasms will have the larger adrenal neoplasm used as the primary lesion responsible for subclinical hypercortisolism . Demographic , clinical , laboratory and pathologic data will be collected for each patient participant . Data will be securely stored in a computerized database . Patients will have biochemical testing to determine if their adrenal neoplasm is functioning or nonfunctioning . Projected accrual will be 15 to 20 patients per year for a total of 5 years . Thus , we anticipate accruing 62 patients on this protocol .",2013-11-27,"May 15, 2018","INCLUSION CRITERIA : An individual with an adrenal neoplasm less than 5 cm in size with biochemically confirmed evidence of hypercortisolism ( 2 out of 3 : dexamethasone suppression test ( DST ) > 3 mcgl/dL , elevated urine free cortisol , and/or morning adrenocorticotropic hormone ( ACTH ) 10 Hounsfield units on an unenhanced computed tomography ( CT ) scan , and delayed washout of contrast ) .",4,0,18 Years,99 Years

Montefiore Medical Center,NCT02003911,Azithromycin for Children Hospitalized With Asthma,Montefiore Medical Center,4,0,Asthma,Drug,Azithromycin,Treatment,Quadruple,"Asthma is a chronic lung condition in children , and often requires hospitalization for acute exacerbations . Azithromycin has been used successfully in other chronic lung diseases , including cystic fibrosis . Despite limited clinical evidence , some pediatricians use azithromycin in children hospitalized with asthma , citing either treatment of atypical pathogens or its proposed anti-inflammatory properties . This study proposes a clinical trial to determine if azithromycin will shorten length of stay in children hospitalized with acute asthma exacerbations .","Asthma is a chronic lung condition that accounts for over 130,000 pediatric hospitalizations nationally at a cost of almost 1.4 billion dollars . Atypical pathogens have been implicated both in initiating asthma and triggering acute asthma exacerbations . Azithromycin , a macrolide antibiotic , is known to have antibacterial activity against atypical pathogens and gram positive bacteria . More recently , macrolides have been increasingly used and effective against gram negative bacteria and inflammation in the lungs of patients with chronic respiratory illnesses . This effect may be secondary to the immunomodulatory effects macrolides possess , in addition to their anti-bacterial effects . In long-term therapy with macrolides , patients with asthma have shown improved bronchiolar hyperreactivity , spirometry , symptoms , and quality of life . However , studies of short-term treatment in the acute setting and in children are limited . Some practitioners use azithromycin in the treatment of acute asthma , despite limited data . The investigators propose a double-blind , randomized , placebo-controlled trial of azithromycin in children aged 4-12 years with persistent asthma hospitalized with acute asthma exacerbations . Children will be enrolled within 12 hours of admission and will be randomized to receive three days of either azithromycin or placebo suspension ( 10mg/kg/dose , max of 500mg ) . The primary outcome measure will be length of stay ( LOS ) . Secondary outcome measures will include : days of school/work missed , readmission rates , return to medical care rates , recurrence of symptoms , and steroid courses . In the future , patients may also be approached to enroll in the `` Mechanism Subset Study '' a separate pilot and feasibility study which will require two blood samples and two nasal aspirate samples and will test for atypical pathogens , interleukin-8 levels , and neutrophil/eosinophil counts . The average length of stay for patients in this age range with asthma in 2011 at our institution was 3.0 days . The investigators will enroll to achieve a power of 80 % , with an alpha of 0.05 , which will require 107 patients in each group to detect a 16 hour ( 0.67 day ) difference in the primary outcome , LOS .

University of Minnesota,NCT02002819,Levetiracetam for Alzheimer's Disease-Associated Network Hyperexcitability,University of Minnesota,2,1,Alzheimer's Disease,Drug,levetiracetam,Treatment,Triple,"Patients with Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) can have seizures in addition to losing their memory and other mental functions ( referred to as cognitive functions ) . The seizures , and other examples of overactive electrical activity in the brain that is not noticeable , contribute to the loss of cognitive function . Studies in animal models of AD suggest that a drug that prevents seizures called levetiracetam may reduce neuronal over-excitation and improve cognition . Based on this evidence , the investigators propose to determine if levetiracetam can be used to treat patients with AD . The investigators developed novel instruments for this population that will also be used in future large-scale clinical trials . The current study will last for 12 weeks and will involve people with AD . Participants will be initially examined with an overnight brain wave study to assess for silent epileptic ( seizure-like ) activity . Presence of epileptic activity on the screening exam is not required to enter the trial . Participants will then be assigned to groups in a randomized manner . One group will receive levetiracetam for 4 weeks , then no drug for 4 weeks , and then placebo for 4 weeks . For another group , the order of treatments will be reversed . The cognitive abilities of participants will be retested every 4 weeks and compared to those at the beginning . The cognitive tests include a virtual-reality navigation test of memory and computerized tests of mental flexibility and problem solving . The participants will be monitored with a magnetoencephalogram ( MEG ) with simultaneous EEG ( M/EEG ) at each visit .

Medical University of Graz,NCT02009748,Vitamin D Supplementation in Cirrhotic Patients,Medical University of Graz,2,1,Cirrhosis,Dietary Supplement,Vitamin D supplementation,Treatment,Double,"Previous studies suggested that vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent in cirrhotic patients and is related to the degree of liver dysfunction as well as mortality . In gastrointestinal disorders , vitamin D absorption can be highly reduced . We herein aim to investigate the efficacy of oral vitamin D supplementation in cirrhotic patients with vitamin D insufficiency .","Cirrhosis of the liver is a slowly progressive disease with a high number of complications like hepatic encephalopathy , gastrointestinal bleeding , ascites , renal failure and hepatocellular cancer leading to death . Cirrhosis as a cause of death has increased progressively in the mortality data for the general population . This terminal liver disease as a complication of chronic viral hepatitis , alcoholism and metabolic disorders , with genetic and non-genetic predisposition , may be linked to nutritional aberration as a precursor to or an effect of the illness . Previous studies suggested that chronic liver diseases may be related to high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and in gastrointestinal disorders the vitamin D absorption can be highly reduced . Patients with cirrhosis are often presented with malnutrition and one of the limiting factors of the intestinal malabsorption is the portal hypertension due to the liver disease . Beside nutrition the main source of vitamin D is sunlight and ultraviolet-B inducing the conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to vitamin D in the skin ; therefore limited sunlight exposure of the skin may lead to an inadequate vitamin D status . Vitamin D itself is biologically inactive and has to be hydroxylated in the liver to 25-hydroxyvitamin D ( 25 ( OH ) D ) as the main circulating metabolite used for classification of the vitamin D status . 1,25 hydroxyvitamin D ( 1,25 ( OH ) D ) is produced through conversion by the enzyme 1-alpha-hydroxylase in the kidney . This vitamin D metabolite shows a higher affinity for the vitamin D receptor ( VDR ) compared to 25 ( OH ) D. After binding and activation of the VDR three percent of the human genome will be regulated . Among the main role of vitamin D metabolites to regulate calcium and bone homeostasis , they also show non-skeletal effects with relevance in the development of several chronic diseases . In this context , vitamin D deficiency has been associated with an increased risk of cancer , cardiovascular , autoimmune , and infectious diseases , Based on these findings , a significantly reduced risk of mortality was shown in patients with oral vitamin D supplementation in randomized controlled studies . Our previously published study presented a prospective association of vitamin D levels with occurrence of hepatic decompensation . Furthermore vitamin D deficiency was associated with high mortality in cirrhotic patients dependent on liver dysfunction . Concerning this aspect the main point is to investigate in this study whether low vitamin D status is the consequence of increasing deterioration of the liver synthesis or may even contribute to liver dysfunction . Low synthesis of vitamin D in the skin can be the result of reduced sunlight exposure and malnutrition and/or malabsorption in cirrhotic patients . On the other hand , organ dysfunction may impair the activity of 25-hydroxylase in the liver . Despite the above mentioned correlation between vitamin D deficiency and liver dysfunction there is still insufficient evidence to recommend oral vitamin D supplementation as a concomitant therapy in clinical practice because there exists no adequately designed randomized controlled trial that evaluates the necessary daily oral dose on vitamin D. We aim to address this issue in the present study so that the findings of our study will lead to implementation of treatment strategies for maintaining a sufficient vitamin D status in cirrhotic patients .",2013-12-09,"June 3, 2015",Inclusion Criteria : 25 ( OH ) D levels below 30 ng/ml ( measured at the baseline visit ) Compensated and decompensated cirrhosis diagnosed by the hepatologist for at last three months prior to study start Age between 18 and 75 years Written informed consent Negative pregnancy test in women of childbearing potential Exclusion Criteria : Hypercalcemia defined as total serum calcium > 2.65 mmol/L Pregnancy or lactating women Drug intake as part of another clinical study Glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) < 15 ml/min/1.73m² Any disease with an estimated life expectancy below 1 year Any clinically significant acute disease requiring drug treatment Anticipated chemotherapy or radiation therapy during the study Regular intake of more than 800 International Units ( IU ) of vitamin D during the last 4 weeks before study entry,36,0,18 Years,75 Years

Exposure of the small intestine to gluten causes an inflammatory response , leading to the destruction of intestine lining , often with severe symptoms including diarrhea , abdominal distention , fatigue , weight loss , anemia , and neurological symptoms . CD is a lifelong disease and the only treatment currently available is strict adherence to a life-time gluten free diet ( GFD ) . However , adhering to this diet is difficult as gluten proteins are found in many food products . Therefore , the gluten-free diet has both lifestyle and financial implications for the individual and thus has been potential for impacting adversely on their quality of life . Various approaches are being studied to reduce the need for careful control of the diet for those with CD , including the use of antibodies such as IgY . IgY is produced from the egg yolks of super immunized laying hens . Egg yolk antibodies are natural products with minimal toxicity , for those without egg allergy , and offer low-cost , hygienic production of study product .

Injury to small and medium-sized blood cerebral blood vessels is a well-recognized consequence of traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) . Non-invasive imaging with positron emission tomography ( PET ) and single photon emission computerized tomography ( SPECT ) have long demonstrated deficits in cerebral blood flow in TBI , including in symptomatic patients years after mild TBI ( mTBI ) . Recently , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) methods have been developed which allow reliable and non-invasive measurement of cerebrovascular reactivity ( CVR ) to vasodilatory stimuli such as hypercapnia in humans . These techniques have never been applied to symptomatic patients in the chronic stage after mTBI . These methods are particularly promising due to the recent discovery that phosphodiesterase-5 ( PDE5 ) inhibitors improve cerebral blood flow , induce angiogenesis and neurogenesis , and improve functional recovery in animals after experimental stroke and cryoinjury .

Secondary objective ( Safety and Tolerability ) : Sildenafil therapy ( 25 mg orally twice daily ) is well tolerated in symptomatic patients in the chronic stage after TBI , with few adverse effects and treatment discontinuations in less than 10 % of patients . Tertiary ( Exploratory ) objectives : Single dose treatment with sildenafil ( 50 mg orally ) is effective in increasing the regional BOLD response to hypercapnia in symptomatic patients in the chronic stage after TBI . Patients with persistent symptoms in the chronic stage after TBI have deficits in cerebrovascular reactivity compared to uninjured healthy controls . Patients with persistent symptoms in the chronic stage after TBI have deficits in cerebrovascular reactivity compared to asymptomatic patients after TBI . Patients with persistent symptoms in the chronic stage after TBI have reduced numbers of circulating EPCs compared to uninjured healthy controls . Patients with persistent symptoms in the chronic stage after TBI have reduced numbers of circulating EPCs compared to asymptomatic patients after TBI . The effect on cerebrovascular reactivity of single dose treatment with sildenafil persists after 8 weeks of chronic therapy ( 25 mg orally , twice daily ) . Treatment with sildenafil for 8 weeks ( 25 mg orally twice daily ) increases the number of circulating endothelial progenitor cells ( EPCs ) in symptomatic chronic TBI patients . Treatment with sildenafil for 8 weeks ( 25 mg orally twice daily ) reduces the prevalence of post-concussive symptoms , compared to placebo treatment . Treatment with sildenafil for 8 weeks ( 25 mg orally twice daily ) improves performance in neuropsychometric tests , compared to placebo treatment .",2013-01-03,"December 30, 2015","Inclusion Criteria : Inclusion Criteria applied to all participants In order to be included in this study , all participants must meet the following minimum criteria : Age 18 - 55 years , inclusive Ability to undergo MRI scanning .

The ketogenic diet has been used since the 1920s , but it is used only in children , and is nutritionally unbalanced . It is typically withdrawn after 3 years . The ketogenic diet unfortunately , offers no long-term solution to seizure control . Our preliminary research now suggests that there may be a healthy , long-term dietary approach to controlling seizures . Based on our animal work and published clinical studies the investigators hypothesize that a DHA dose of 3 g/day will reduce seizure frequency in patients with intractable seizures .","This will be a small , double-blind study involving placebo and 3 g/day of DHA . There will be a one-month baseline period , followed by a six month treatment period . Neurologists from the North York General Hospital or Toronto Western Hospital will refer patients being treated for intractable epilepsy . Patients will be contacted by phone by the study coordinator , who will explain the study and ask about willingness to participate . Inclusion and exclusion criteria will be discussed , as well as the patient 's responsibilities . It will be made clear that there will be no cost to the patient . If patients are interested , a letter will be sent to them . The letter will contain a description of the study , the patient 's responsibilities if he/she agrees to participate , and an explanation of informed consent . One week after the letter , the study coordinator will again contact the patients by phone , answer any questions , and - if the patient is willing to participate - set up the initial visit . At the initial visit , the study coordinator will give the subject written and verbal information . Patients will be asked to sign an informed consent form . They will be given a seizure diary , to keep during the first month ( prior to treatment ) and to continue for the six months of treatment . The diary will record the frequency/type of seizures . The study physician will review the medial history ( seizure frequency/type ) , medications and blood work to be taken to measure serum levels of AEDs and n-3 PUFAs . About two teaspoons of extra blood will be taken and stored for possible future assays . The study coordinator will then provide the patients with their appropriate capsules for the first three months of the trial . The rest will be mailed . The patient will receive written instructions on how to take the capsules . Only the study coordinator will know the patients ' group assignments .

Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ) represents the more severe end of this spectrum and is characterized by steatosis , ballooning degeneration and lobular inflammation with or without fibrosis . The etiology of NASH is not completely understood , but it is often associated with obesity , type 2 diabetes , hyperlipidemia and insulin resistance . Lipotoxicity , insulin resistance and oxidative stress appear to be central to the pathogenesis of NASH . Currently , there is no FDA approved treatment for NAFLD/NASH . Weight loss and exercise are the recommended but often difficult maintain these lifestyle changes in the long term and therefore therapeutic agents have been investigated . Ezetimibe is an LDL lowering agent that works through inhibition of the fat absorption from the small intestine . In this study , we propose to treat 50 patients with NASH with either Ezetimibe or placebo for 24 weeks . After an initial evaluation for insulin sensitivity , MRI liver fat distribution and liver biopsy , patients will receive either 10 mg/day of Ezetimibe or placebo .

NEPAP is currently approved for use only in adults .,"The nasal expiratory positive airway pressure ( NEPAP ) device has been used to treat OSAS in adults . A disposable device is placed in each nostril at night and attached with adhesive . The device acts as a one-way valve , during inspiration the valve opens , with negligible resistance to flow . During expiration , the valve closes and airflow is directed through small air channels , increasing resistance . The increased resistance helps to maintain the upper airway pressure during the critical end-expiratory period when the upper airway has been found to be most narrow in the breaths preceding an apnea event . In contrast to Continuous Positive Airway Pressure ( CPAP ) which provides positive pressure during both inspiration and expiration , NEPAP creates pressure during expiration .

University of Pennsylvania,NCT01764685,Topiramate to Reduce Heavy Drinking in HIV-Positive Heavy Drinkers,University of Pennsylvania,2,0,Heavy Drinking,Drug,Topiramate,Treatment,Double,"Heavy drinking ( HD ) is a risk factor for HIV transmission and is more common in HIV+ individuals than in the general population . HD adversely affects health directly and reduces adherence to antiretroviral therapies ( ARTs ) , in part due to alcohol-induced cognitive impairment . Reduced drinking improves cognitive performance and adherence to ARTs . Medications approved in the United States to treat alcohol dependence have a small effect size . However , topiramate , FDA-approved as an anticonvulsant and a prophylaxis for migraine , has a greater effect size in reducing drinking and promoting abstinence in alcohol dependent individuals . To date , there are no studies of the effects of topiramate in HIV+ heavy drinkers . The investigators propose to conduct a randomized , parallel-groups , placebo-controlled , 11-week trial of topiramate in 40 HIV+ heavy drinkers who want to reduce or stop their drinking . There are three primary hypotheses for this feasibility and proof-of-concept study . First , the investigators hypothesize that topiramate-treated patients will decrease the frequency of their HD more than placebo-treated patients . Second , based on scores from computerized neurocognitive assessments , the investigators hypothesize that topiramate and placebo groups will show similar performance on a battery of cognitive tests . Third , based on self-reported medication adherence , the investigators hypothesize that adherence to ARTs will be greater in the topiramate group than in the placebo group . These findings will provide preliminary data to support a more definitive trial of topiramate for the treatment of HD in HIV+ heavy drinkers .","A . General Design : This study will employ an 11-week , parallel-groups design ( TOP vs. placebo ) to test the effects of topiramate ( TOP ) on HD by HIV+ individuals with a current alcohol use disorder . We will gradually increase the dosage of TOP from 25 mg/day to 150 mg/day over a 6-week period to minimize adverse events . Random assignment to treatment group and double-blind conditions will be maintained throughout the study . B . Recruiting : HIV+ men and women will be recruited through advertisements and by collaboration with physicians in the University of Pennsylvania Health System ( UPHS ) who will be invited to refer patients for whom heavy drinking in their HIV+ patients has created medical concerns . Patients will be recruited using the following methods : through referrals to the research center at the University of Pennsylvania ( UPenn ) ; by posting/distributing recruitment materials in community settings with public posting areas or other means of providing community access to materials ( such as hospitals , town halls , public libraries , YMCA , health fairs/organizations ) ; and through advertisements in local media ( including text ads in newspapers , magazines ; radio ads on local radio stations ; web ads on internet sites and web postings on community message boards and research listings ) . These methods have been successful for Dr. Kranzler at the University of Pennsylvania and for many investigators at the Treatment Research Center ( TRC ) at UPenn . The TRC is an active center for clinical investigation and the staff and faculty there are highly experienced and capable in the conduct of clinical trials such as this . We will use institution-approved recruitment materials to advertise for regular or daily drinkers who are HIV+ and want to reduce their drinking . We will obtain permission at selected locations before distributing or posting the approved recruitment materials ( to ensure that we comply with other institutions ' guidelines ) . We anticipate that approximately 40 % of patients will be women and that minority patients will be represented at least in proportion to the general population in Philadelphia . Based upon the large number of potential patients and our success in recruitment for prior studies , including those involving heavy drinkers , we are confident of our ability to achieve our recruitment goals . C. Study Visits : At the screening visit , patients will provide informed consent and their reading ability will be evaluated , a medical and psychiatric history obtained . Blood and urine samples will be taken for routine clinical laboratory evaluations ( including GGTP ) , drug screening , and pregnancy testing in females of reproductive potential . Patients will be interviewed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV ( SCID ) . Patients who are excluded will be referred to treatment . The baseline visit will occur 1-14 days after the screening visit . Eligible patients will undergo a research evaluation , complete a packet of questionnaires , complete cognitive testing , and be interviewed by the research assistant . A physical examination will be performed by a study physician or nurse practitioner . Eligible patients will receive their first counseling session and first supply of study medication during a subsequent treatment session the same day . We will use urn randomization , a probabilistic balancing procedure to assign patients to medication group so that groups are balanced on key variables ( Wei 1978 ) : sex , race ( white or non-white ) , number of HD days in past month . During the 11-week treatment period , patients will return to the clinic weekly for five weeks while the dosage of the medication is gradually increased and then biweekly for six weeks . For patient safety during travel , they will be instructed not to drink prior to study visits . At each visit , the patient 's breath alcohol level , weight , and vital signs will be measured . They will complete questionnaires and cognitive testing , and be interviewed by the research nurse about their use of concurrent medications , the occurrence of adverse events , and protocol compliance and then receive the medical management intervention . During visit 9 ( end of treatment week 11 ) , patients will complete questionnaires and cognitive testing and be interviewed by the research evaluator concerning their alcohol consumption . Patients will be compensated for this end-of-treatment visit . Patients will also be interviewed by the research nurse about their use of concomitant medications , occurrence of adverse events , compliance with the protocol , and their assessment of the effectiveness and acceptability of the treatment procedures ( through the Medication Questionnaire ; MED-Q ) . The nurse will dispense 4 days of medication for the taper and instruct the patient on how to take the medication during this period . Blood samples to measure serum GGTP will be obtained to assess the validity of self-reported drinking . A study nurse or research coordinator will call the patient one week after the endpoint visit to confirm that the subject completed the medication taper . Continuing adverse events will be followed by the study nurse and physician to their conclusion , as is feasible . Patients requesting ( or clearly needing ) additional treatment for alcohol problems will be referred to local treatment centers . All patients ( including those who discontinue treatment prematurely ) will be asked to complete an end-of-treatment evaluation and to complete all scheduled assessments to facilitate intention-to-treat ( ITT ) analyses . For patients who withdraw early and do not wish to continue with study visits/procedures , all end-of-treatment procedures will be administered at the time of withdrawal . Such patients will also be asked to undergo in-person or telephone follow-up at end-of-treatment for collection of the remaining treatment-phase Timeline Followback ( TLFB ) data . D. Compensation : Patients will be compensated for their time and transportation . E. Study Treatments : Throughout the study , we will maintain double-blind conditions with respect to medication administration . The research nurse , who is experienced in the conduct of alcohol pharmacotherapy trials , will deliver the medical management and monitor the medication , including capsule counts to measure adherence . The physician will meet with the patient initially , meet at least weekly with the nurse to discuss progress , and evaluate the patient in the event of severe or persistent adverse effects . The nurse will dispense study medications prescribed by the physician . Patients with severe psychological symptoms ( e.g. , suicidal thoughts ) will be withdrawn from treatment and referred for appropriate clinical care . An effort will be made to obtain outcome information on all randomized patients for ITT analysis . In the medication condition , TOP will be administered at a maximum of 150 mg/day in two divided doses . TOP will be purchased commercially and formulated in opaque capsules by the Investigational Drug Service ( IDS ) at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine , which will purchase the TOP commercially and formulate the medication in capsules . Placebo will be formulated to match the active medication , such that inspection of the capsules will not permit the two to be differentiated . F. Assessments : Laboratory/Medical Assessments : These assessments are included to screen patients for medical exclusion criteria , assess potential adverse effects of medications , and corroborate self-reported drinking . Prior to entrance into the study , each patient will receive : A physical examination Urinalysis and urine toxicology Complete Blood Count ( CBC ) Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase Levels ( GGTP ) A chemistry panel ( which includes electrolytes , liver enzymes , bilirubin , uric acid ) Pregnancy testing in women of reproductive age ( conducted at screening and then at the midpoint of the trial ) . At the midpoint and end of the 11-week treatment phase , GGTP will be repeated to corroborate self-reported alcohol consumption . In addition to eliciting self-reported adverse events , weight and vital signs ( blood pressure and pulse ) will be obtained at each treatment visit . Psychological/Behavioral Assessments : Sociodemographic information and alcohol dependence family history will be obtained at baseline . Locator information : At baseline , the research assistant will obtain information on patient locators nominated by the patient , which helps to maintain patients in treatment and enhances follow-up data collection . Psychiatric diagnosis : The Structured Clinical Interview ( SCID-I/P ; First et al . 2001 ) for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-IV ( DSM-IV ) will be used at baseline to classify patients according to the presence or absence of standard psychiatric disorders according to DSM-IV ( American Psychiatric Association 1994 ) . Alcohol use patterns and medication adherence : The Timeline Followback ( TLFB ; Sobell and Sobell 1992 ) will be used to estimate current medication adherence and alcohol consumption and drinking at intake and at each subsequent study visit . This interview procedure will provide quantity/frequency of alcohol consumption data for the period prior to the interview and since the last interview . Cogstate computerized battery : To examine the cognitive effects of changes in drinking behavior and of TOP treatment , we will administer the 20-minute battery biweekly . We will use these tasks : Detection Task , Identification Task , One Card Learning Task , One Back Memory Task , Shopping List Task , Groton Maze Learning Test . Iowa Gambling Task ( IGT ) ( Decision Making and Impulsivity ) [ 15 minutes ] : The IGT ( Bechara et al . 1994 ) is a computerized gambling task intended to simulate real-world decision making . Prior research indicates that it is sensitive to cognitive impairment in HIV populations ( Martin et al . 2004 ) as well as substance users . Because practice effects are possible , the IGT will only be administered at baseline , midpoint ( Visit 6 ) , and endpoint ( Visit 9 ) . Depressive symptoms : Beck Depression Inventory ( BDI ) Medication adverse effects : Patients will provide subjective reports of adverse effects at each study visit using a list of adverse medication effects derived from completed studies of TOP for AD . Adherence to antiretroviral medication : We will use the Timeline Followback method to determine the percentage of ART doses taken each day as prescribed . Checklist of Cognitive Complaints : Individuals will rate their perceived impairment in everyday function in the domains of attention , memory , and decision making .

West German Study Group,NCT01891357,Phase II Trial to Validate Markers for a Response Evaluation of a Combined Therapy in Patients With HER2+ Breast Cancer,West German Study Group,2,0,"Carcinoma, Ductal, Breast",Procedure,Biopsy before and after three weeks of study treatment,Treatment,,The Neo-PREDICT-HER2 Study is phase II trial to validate predictive markers for the response evaluation of a combined chemo-immunotherapy in patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer . The only treatment arm consists of Paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 weekly for 12 weeks with lapatinib 750 mg P.O . daily and trastuzumab 2 mg/kg IV ( loading dose 4 mg/kg ) weekly for 12 weeks .,"Trastuzumab ( T ) -containing neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been reported to increase the probability of pathological complete response ( pCR ) in HER2 positive disease up to 67 % . Large trials revealed pCR rates ( no remaining invasive and in situ components ) of about 30-40 % , if anthracyclines/taxane based polychemotherapy was applied or about 40-45 % if no invasive tumor in the breast and lymph nodes was used as a pCR definition . Nevertheless , resistance to trastuzumab remains one of the most important challenges in adjuvant and metastatic breast cancer therapy causing poor prognosis with an increased incidence of cerebral metastasis and limited therapeutic options after disease progression6 . An improvement shows the combination of trastuzumab and lapatinib , which has been reported to have increased efficacy in in-vitro and in metastatic setting in patients who were mostly resistant to both therapies in the previous course of disease . Recent data from the neoadjuvant setting ( neoALTTO ) - on a paclitaxel backbone - showed a significantly higher pCR rate after L + T than with either compound separately ( 47 % vs. 20 % and 27.6 % respectively ) . Several trials are planned to evaluate the combination of both therapies in the adjuvant and neoadjuvant setting . Clinical response measured by sequential evaluation of different proliferation markers ( such as Ki-67 ) following a course of neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been demonstrated to correlate significantly with an increased risk of relapse in patients not achieving pathological complete response . It is therefore clinically relevant to evaluate such proliferation tools for early prediction of combination therapy efficacy ( chemotherapy and HER2 targeted therapy ) . So far , it remains unclear which method of proliferation measurement is the optimal marker for response evaluation regarding a combined chemo-immunotherapy . However , measurement of proliferation and apoptosis genes as well as assessment of changes in Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases ( PI3K ) , Protein Kinase B ( AKT ) , Insulin-like Growth Factor ( IGF ) and stem cell signalling after a short course of therapy could provide a unique signature for a dynamic response evaluation . The planned trial will validate predictive markers and a dynamic model based on the sequential evaluation of different proliferation and apoptosis markers . Furthermore it will assess the pCR-rate after 12 weeks of therapy . The aim of the study is to define a predictive marker for the response evaluation of a combined chemo-immunotherapy .",2013-05-14,"September 16, 2019","Inclusion Criteria : Female patients , age at diagnosis 18 - 75 years Histological confirmed unilateral primary invasive carcinoma of the breast Clinical Stage Tumor 1 ( cT1 ) ( > 1 cm ) - Clinical Stage Tumor 4 ( cT4 ) ( if operable , inflammatory breast cancer is excluded ) HER2 over-expressing tumor confirmed by : 3+ by Immuno-histochemistry ( IHC ) and/or HER2/neu gene amplification by fluorescence , chromogenic or silver in-situ hybridization [ Fluorescent In-Situ Hybridization ( FISH ) , Chromogenic In-Situ Hybridization ( CISH ) or Silver In-Situ Hybridization ( SISH ) ; > 6 HER2 gene copies per nucleus or a FISH , CISH or SISH test ratio ( HER2 gene copies to chromosome 17 signals ) of ≥ 2.0 ] Clinically node positive disease or node negative disease No clinical evidence for distant metastasis ( cM0 ) after conventional staging Performance Status Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) ≤ 1 or Karnofsky Index ( KI ) ≥ 80 % Baseline Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction ( LVEF ) > 50 % measured by echocardiography Negative pregnancy test ( urine or serum ) within 7 days prior to start of induction treatment in premenopausal patients The patient must be accessible for treatment and follow-up Written informed consent including a written informed consent for shipping of tumor block for central pathology review and evaluation prior to the start of any study procedures Exclusion Criteria : Known hypersensitivity reaction to the compounds or incorporated substances Known polyneuropathy grade ≥ 2 Have acute or currently active or requiring anti-viral therapy hepatic or biliary disease ( with exception of patients with Gilbert 's syndrome , asymptomatic gallstones , stable chronic liver disease per investigator assessment ) .

The study compares quality measures based on the guidelines for two dissemination strategies : a multi-faceted , practice-directed intervention or standard dissemination . Methods : Two primary care research networks recruited practices and provided support for the intervention and outcome evaluations . Individual practices were randomly assigned to either the intervention or control groups using a cluster randomized design based on network affiliation , number of clinicians per practice , urban vs. nonurban location , and practice type . In this design , the units of observation are individual children because outcomes are abstracted from medical records for individual patients . The units of randomization are physician practices . This results in a multilevel design in which patients are nested within practices . Implementation The intervention practices receive toolkits , including guideline summaries and slides , a patient and family behavior change workbook , and a clinical decision support tool . Guideline implementation was promoted through an introductory academic detailing session and the use of an ongoing e-learning group . The intervention strategy was further enhanced by aligning this project with the American Board of Pediatrics quality improvement Maintenance of Certification ( MOC ) requirements and offers voluntary MOC participation to participants .

New York State Psychiatric Institute,NCT01893632,Gabapentin Treatment of Benzodiazepine Dependence,New York State Psychiatric Institute,2,0,Benzodiazepine Dependence,Drug,gabapentin,Treatment,Triple,"Benzodiazepine dependence is a growing public health problem for which very few evidenced-based treatment approaches are available . Approximately 683,000 individuals met past year criteria for sedative-hypnotic use disorders in the US during 2010 , a prevalence greater than heroin or methamphetamine dependence . The most commonly prescribed sedative-hypnotic agents are the benzodiazepines . Chronic use induces pharmacodynamic tolerance in the GABA neurotransmitter system and individuals with physiological dependence find benzodiazepines difficult to discontinue because of withdrawal or rebound symptoms , which include autonomic arousal , depression , anxiety , and insomnia . Available evidence-based treatment approaches have been primarily directed at therapeutic users of benzodiazepines who do not meet criteria for a substance use disorder , with a general consensus that the gradual taper of benzodiazepines over a period of several months is the optimal approach . However , patients with benzodiazepine dependence are typically referred for inpatient detoxification treatment , which rapidly tapers patients off benzodiazepines . Protracted withdrawal symptoms frequently persist after discharge , predisposing patients to relapse . More effective pharmacotherapeutic strategies are needed for the treatment of benzodiazepine dependence in the outpatient setting .","Gabapentin has proven to be a safe and well-tolerated medication with a low abuse liability , thereby making it ideal for use in the outpatient setting .

Columbia University,NCT01898806,Intralesional Steroids in the Treatment of Alopecia Areata,Columbia University,4,0,Alopecia Areata,Drug,Intralesional Triamcinolone 2.5 mg/ml,Treatment,Double,"This study aims to determine the frequency of response to treatment with 3 concentrations of IL TAC , 2.5mg/ml , 5mg/ml or 10mg/ml as well as the duration of response and incidence of side effects compared to treatment with placebo ( sterile saline solution ) . After the 1st 6 months , nonresponders or partial responders may be treated for 6 months with open label triamcinolone at the dose deemed appropriate by the investigator . The investigators will also perform skin biopsies of the scalp and draw blood at selected time points in order to examine the immunohistochemical/pathological response in scalp hair follicles and the systemic circulation to treatment with IL TAC for alopecia areata .","Alopecia areata ( AA ) is a major medical problem and is the most prevalent autoimmune disease in the US . AA represents the second most common form of hair loss and causes significant disfigurement and psychological distress to affected individuals . AA affects more individuals than most other autoimmune diseases combined , including lupus erythematosus , type 1 diabetes , psoriasis , multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis . In contrast to these conditions , research into the pathogenesis and the development of innovative therapies in AA has lagged behind . Alopecia areata is a common form of hair loss which reportedly occurs in up to 1.7 % of the population at some time in their life . Alopecia areata is apparently triggered when the individual 's own immune system attacks hair follicles on the scalp or body resulting in hair loss ranging from single patches on the scalp ( patch type alopecia areata ) to loss of every hair on the scalp and body ( alopecia universalis ) . Currently , there are limited treatment options for alopecia areata and unfortunately , the treatments utilized have never been rigorously tested in a placebo controlled trial . Triamcinolone ( Kenalog ) is a steroid solution that has been used as a treatment for alopecia areata for over 50 years . It is administered via injection into the scalp and appears to have some efficacy for patients with mild to moderate alopecia areata . The investigators currently do not have objective data on the frequency of occurrence of successful regrowth , the duration of response or the incidence of side effects . Intralesional triamcinolone ( IL TAC ) is arguably the most commonly used treatments for AA , especially in patients with less than 50 % hair loss . Despite this , there are no adequately powered , randomized controlled clinical trials ( RCTs ) examining the efficacy , safety , and duration of effect of IL TAC . In addition , the dosage or strength used varies among practitioners and the efficacy and safety of alternate doses of IL TAC has never been examined in a well designed RCT .

Recent studies have shown some success with oral or sublingual immunotherapy for the treatment of food allergy . Oral treatment , which requires very high doses , is associated with a small but appreciable risk of systemic reactions . Sublingual immunotherapy , which utilizes much smaller doses , is safer but constraints inherent in the available methods of sublingual administration have limited the utility of this method . Typically sublingual immunotherapy for food allergy has used either fresh foods or a simple liquid extract . These methods are not optimized for practicality or dwell duration in the mouth , and , thus far , dosing has been limited by the ability to make concentrated extracts and by the volume of extract that can be applied to the sublingual space .

There is large variation in platelet aggregation between individuals . As the genetic message to the cell machinery is conveyed through its transcriptome , we hypothesize that much of the variability in platelet function can be explained by transcriptome changes including differences in gene or isoform expression , altered splicing events , or allele-specific expression . Moreover , aspirin modifies gene expression in several cells , but whether it also affects platelet transcriptome has not yet been studied . Our goal is to characterize the platelet transcriptome and identify genes that are up- or down-regulated after 4-week aspirin therapy . A major strength of our study is that it enrolls individuals from European Americans and African Americans and thus will have the ability to study similarities and differences between the two .

National Institutes of Health Clinical Center (CC),NCT01896622,The Interaction of Two HIV Medications With Blood Clot Medications in Healthy Volunteers,National Institutes of Health Clinical Center (CC),1,1,HIV,Drug,Ritonavir,Treatment,,"Background : - People who have the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) often take several medications to control their disease . They may also need to take medicine to prevent blood clots . Taking both kinds of medicine together can cause bleeding or other problems . But this might not happen if the medications are taken at different times . Researchers will study two particular HIV drugs ( ritonavir and cobicistat ) and how they interact with blood clot medications . Objectives : -To understand how HIV medicine and blood clot medicine interact , so doctors can choose what to prescribe for people who take both . Eligibility : - Healthy adults between 18 and 70 years old who are not on any medications . Design : Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history . Blood samples will be collected . Urine samples will be collected from participants who might become pregnant . Participants will visit the National Institutes of Health 7 times after the screening visit . Three visits will last about 12 hours . The other 4 will last about 1 hour . Participants will take a daily dose of either study medication for 22 days . They will keep a diary of medicine they take and any side effects . Treatment will be monitored with blood tests over about 2 months . When the study of one drug is completed , the next drug study will begin with a different group of participants .","Advances in antiretroviral ( ARV ) pharmacotherapy have translated to increased longevity and improved quality of life in people living with HIV ; hence , elderly individuals comprise an increasing proportion of today s HIV population . Moreover , HIV infection itself has become recognized as a condition characterized by a hypercoaguable state and premature immunologic aging . Potential interactions between ARVs and anticoagulant medications are of particular concern considering that many elderly , and even non-elderly HIV patients will require short-term or chronic anticoagulation to prevent and/or treat systemic embolism . Dabigatran , administered as dabigatran etexilate , is an oral irreversible , competitive direct thrombin inhibitor , which has been shown to be superior to warfarin , and non-inferior to enoxaparin , in preventing thromboembolism in patients with atrial fibrillation and undergoing orthopedic surgery , respectively . While dabigatran itself is not a substrate of Permeability-glycoprotein ( P-gp ) , its inactivepro-drug , dabigatran etexilate , is a substrate of P-gp . Co-administration of dabigatran etexilate with P-gp modulators has resulted in significant changes in dabigatran exposure . The pharmacokinetic enhancers , ritonavir and cobicistat , as inhibitors of P-gp , are expected to increase plasma concentrations of dabigatran ; however , neither agent has been studied in combination with dabigatran etexilate , to date . Hence , the purpose of this study is to determine whether the separate co-administration of ritonavir or cobicistat with dabigatran etexilate increases the systemic exposure of dabigatran in healthy volunteers , and if so , whether adjusting the administration times of these medications can circumvent this interaction . In this open-label study , 32 healthy volunteers will be assigned to 1 of 2 groups . Group A will consist of 16 subjects who will take 22 days of ritonavir ; Group B will consist of 16 subjects who will take 22 days of cobicistat . All subjects will receive 3 separated single doses of dabigatran etexilate . Pharmacokinetic ( PK ) and pharmacodynamics ( PD ) sampling for dabigatran will occur on Days 0 1 , Day 19 1 20 , and Day 26 1 27 . The PD effects of dabigatran will be characterized via ecarin clotting time ( ECT ) measurements . Dabigatran PK/PD parameters will be determined using non-compartmental methods with the WinNonlin professional computer program ( version 5.2 ; Pharsight Corporation , Mountain View , CA ) . The following PK/PD parameters will be compared between the groups : area under the curve from 0 to 24 hours ( AUC0-24 ) , maximum total dabigatran plasma concentration ( Cmax ) , area under the curve from 0 to infinity hours ( AUC0- ) , time to maximum plasma concentration ( tmax ) , terminal half-life ( T ( Omega ) ) , apparent oral clearance ( CL/F ) , area under the effect curve from 0 to 24 hours ( AUEC0-24 ) , and the maximum effect ratio over baseline ( ERmax ) .",2013-07-06,"June 30, 2017","INCLUSION CRITERIA : A subject will be considered eligible for this study only if all of the following criteria are met : Between the ages 18 70 years .

Haukeland University Hospital,NCT01892644,Treatment of Iron Overload With Deferasirox (Exjade) in Hereditary Hemochromatosis and Myelodysplastic Syndrome,Haukeland University Hospital,2,0,Hemochromatosis,Drug,Deferasirox,Treatment,,"Hypothesis : Deferasirox can be used as a therapeutic agent to deplete the liver , heart and bone marrow of excess iron in patients with iron overload caused by myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) and hemochromatosis ( HC . Assess the effect of new serum biomarkers ( NTBI and hepcidin ) and MRI as indicators of iron overload and their usefulness to monitor iron depletion treatment . Study the effect of iron overload and iron depletion on intracellular signal transduction , trace metals concentrations in serum and urine and markers of oxidative stress in blood cells and urine .","The two most important causes of iron overload disease in humans are the iron-loading disorder hereditary hemochromatosis ( HC ) , and transfusional siderosis in patients with chronic hematological diseases like myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) , thalassemia , and leukemia . Hemochromatosis . In HC the molecular regulation of iron uptake across the intestinal mucosa is disturbed , leading to hyperabsorption and accumulation of iron in parenchymal tissues such as the liver , pancreas , endocrine organs and heart . Hepcidin , a small peptide hormone synthesized in the liver , apparently functions as the master regulator of systemic iron homeostasis by its ability to control the efflux of iron from the enterocytes and macrophages into blood plasma . This happens by diminishing the iron transfer capacity through the basolateral , transmembrane protein , ferroportin . Expression of hepcidin is carefully adjusted by the iron status of the hepatocytes through a multimolecular signal transducing pathway which acts as a positive feedback mechanism with increased hepcidin synthesis in iron overload ( and inflammation ) . Mutation of one of the signal molecules , leads to inadequate hepcidin synthesis . The most common are the classic C282Y and H63D point mutations of the hemochromatosis protein HFE , which disturbs its interaction with the transferrin receptor 1 , the first step in the hepcidin signal cascade . Homozygosity for C282Y is the strongest risk factor for serious iron overload and disease which develops after a long-lasting , asymptomatic period . In Norway the prevalence of C283Y homozygosity is approximately 0.75 in both genders . The preclinical , biochemical phenotype of HC is disclosed by blood tests with elevated transferrin saturation as a marker of hyperabsorption of iron , and increasing ferritin concentration as a surrogate marker of a growing iron overload . As an alternative to liver biopsy , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) seems to be a powerful non-invasive method to directly assess the iron content of the liver and heart . Myelodysplastic syndrome and transfusional siderosis . Transfusional iron overload is the result of multiple blood transfusions supplied over a long time period , each of which adds approximately 220 to 250 mg of extra iron to the body . Because iron loading occurs via a parenteral route with the macrophages as the primary target cells , the normal homeostatic mechanisms are not responding adequately and the plasma hepcidin level can be normal or even increased . Even if excess iron is better tolerated in macrophages than in parenchymal cells , a life-threatening iron overload develops much faster with transfusional siderosis than HFE-associated HC . Myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) is a heterogeneous group of stem cell disorders with inefficient hematopoiesis and increased risk of developing acute myeloid leukemia . The MDS International Prognostic Scoring System ( IPSS ) which is based on numbers of cytopenias , cytogenetic features and number of blasts in the bone marrow , enables separation of four risk groups with the following median survival years : low-risk patients , 5.7 years ; intermediate-1 , 3.5 years ; intermediate-2 , 1.2 years ; and high-risk 0.4 years . Many patients become transfusion-dependent and get serious transfusional iron overload . Iron chelation is recommended to low-risk and intermediate-1 patients with probable need of lifelong transfusion therapy . Consequences of iron overload . If not interrupted , continuous iron loading will at some point start to gradually damage vital organs such as liver , heart and endocrine organs , and lead to serious disease and a shortened lifetime . At the molecular level persistently increased amounts of reactive , small molecular weight iron complexes or the sporadic presence of free iron in blood and tissues , are probably the fundamental pathogenetic mechanism in iron overload . These substances are highly toxic due to their strong ability to catalyze the formation of free radicals such as Reactive Oxygen Species ( ROS ) . The activity of free radicals with damage of native molecules ( e.g . DNA ) and cellular structures is considered to be the first step in organ and tissue injury . In blood , reactive iron exists as Non-Transferrin Bound Iron ( NTBI ) , mainly in the form of small molecular weight iron-citrate complexes . NTBI is rapidly taken up by the liver and other organs where it adds to the intracellular , reactive labile iron pool ( LIP ) . The presence of NTBI and LIP has been found to correlate with hepatic and cardiac damage in transfusional siderosis and HC . In addition , the homeostasis of other trace metals may be abnormal in iron overload . Little is known about this issue , which warrants a deeper study . Treatment . In HC , the preferred iron removal therapy is venesection , whilst transfusional iron overload is treated with iron chelators . Clinical aims of study . The major objective is to determine the efficacy of deferasirox to remove iron from the liver , heart and bone marrow in HC- and MDS-patients with iron overload . Explorative aims . Determine the correlation between the novel biomarkers hepcidin and NTBI , and ferritin and transferrin saturation in serum ; and liver iron concentration ( LIC ) , heart iron concentration ( HIC ) , and bone marrow iron . Assess the effect of iron overload and iron depletion with either deferasirox or venesection , on the concentration of trace metals in serum and urine in HC and MDS patients . Study the influence of iron overload and iron depletion with either deferasirox or venesection , on intracellular signal transduction in blood cells isolated from HC and MDS patients . Study the influence of iron overload and iron depletion with either deferasirox or venesection on oxidative damage of DNA ( examined in urine ) , and the antioxidant status in red blood cells isolated from HC and MDS patients . Establish reference values for the investigational serum and urine tests in healthy control subjects . Rationale of the study . The major rationale of the study is related to the need to assess the potential use of deferasirox to treat HC- and MDS-patients with iron overload . However , several `` learning objectives '' are included : the impact of iron overload and iron depleting treatment on NTBI , hepcidin , markers of oxidative stress , trace metals and intracellular signal transduction molecules . Although venesection is a safe and effective means of depleting iron in HC patients , it may suppress hepcidin and thus increase iron absorption , particularly at the end of a long treatment period . Also , some HC patients not only feel the cumbersome impact of frequent phlebotomies in daily life , but also experience troublesome side effects . The subjective perception of venesection side effects was recently communicated in a survey study among 210 HC patients across the United States and some european countries . Of these , 52 % of patients undergoing weekly venesections and 37 % of the patients in the maintenance phase reported side effects `` always '' or `` most of the time '' , and 16 % would `` definitely '' or `` probably '' refuse phlebotomy if they were offered an alternative treatment . Therefore , investigation of the effect of chelator as a potential alternative therapy in HC is warranted . Chelation therapy may not only remove excess iron from the body , but may also counteract formation of reactive , free radicals . In MDS patients transfusion dependency worsens the survival due to development of damaging iron overload . With every 500 ng/mL increase of s ferritin above the threshold , the risk of death increases by 30 % . Traditionally , iron depletion therapy has been monitored by s-ferritin , which decreases as iron is progressively eliminated . However , s-ferritin is a non-specific parameter which is sensitive to acute phase reactions associated with inflammations , chronic diseases and tissue injury . Furthermore , s-ferritin does not offer information about the burden of free radical production stimulated by reactive iron . For this reason , one aim of this study will be to investigate whether new blood markers like NTBI and hepcidin , along with MRI assessment of LIC and HIC , will improve the diagnosis of iron overload and more accurately identify those patients who are at increased risk of iron induced damage and therefore will benefit from iron depletion therapy . Iron overload can weaken the cellular antioxidant defence and result in oxidative DNA-damage as the first step in carcinogenesis . Examination of the influence of iron overload and iron depletion with either deferasirox or venesection on oxidative damage of DNA , and on the antioxidant status in red blood cells will be performed . Increased knowledge of how intracellular signal transduction is influenced by cellular iron and use of deferasirox may provide new insights into the molecular pathogenesis of iron overload . This will be examined in single leukocyte cell flowcytometry assays of the following intracelluar signal parameters : stress sensor p53 , mTOR and NFkB . Finally , little is known about how iron overload interacts with the metabolism of other trace metals . The concentration of a broad spectrum of trace metals in serum ( S ) and urine ( U ) will be monitored throughout the study period by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry ( ICP-MS ) ( 28 ) : boron ( S , U ) , barium ( S , U ) , beryllium ( S , U ) , cadmium ( S , U ) , cobalt ( S , U ) , cesium ( S , U ) , copper ( S , U ) , mercury ( U ) , lithium ( U ) , manganese ( S ) , molybdenum ( S ) , nickel ( S , U ) , lead ( S , U ) , antimony ( S , U ) , selenium ( S , U ) , tin ( S , U ) , strontium ( S , U ) , thallium ( S , U ) , tungsten ( S ) , yttrium ( S , U ) , zinc ( S , U ) . The tolerability of deferasirox will also be assessed throughout the study , either as sole treatment in MDS patients or compared to venesection in HC patients . Healthy volunteers are used solely as controls to determine the normal blood concentration of the biomarkers and tests which will be performed in the patients . The controls will not be treated . Previous clinical trials in HC and MDS . Deferasirox has been studied in a variety of diseases with transfusional iron overload , particularly in thalassemia . It has a favorable profile with respect to efficacy , safety and tolerability . However , controlled clinical studies with deferasirox in HC and MDS are limited . The study by Phatak et al ( 2010 ) was the first clinical trial to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of deferasirox in patients with C282Y-homzygot hemochromatosis . They showed that serum ferritin levels were reduced similarly in two cohorts given respectively 10 mg/kg/day and 15 mg/kg/day of deferasirox . Since the dose of 15 mg/kg/day caused a higher frequency of adverse events ( AEs ) , they recommended a staring dose of 10 mg/kg/day to be most appropriate in HC- patients . The most important AEs were associated with an increase in serum creatinine and liver enzymes . The study was limited by pretreatment of some patients with phlebotomy prior to the deferasirox study ; in addition , many of the patients had only mild iron overload . For this reason , we see no argument to use a higher dose in our study , and therefore we choose a starting deferasirox dose of 10 mg/kg/day in HC- patients . In a recent study , 24 heavily transfused MDS patients were enrolled to receive 52 weeks of deferasirox therapy . Deferasirox was well tolerated and effectively reduced LIC , labile plasma iron and s-ferritin in patients completing 24 to 52 weeks of therapy , despite ongoing receipt of red blood cell transfusions . In addition to reducing long-term toxicity of iron overload , chelation therapy has shown beneficial effects on hematopoiesis in a small proportion of MDS patients . One ongoing study comparing deferasirox with placebo was found in Cochrane search carried out in June 2010 . Pharmacokinetics of deferasirox . Deferasirox ( Exjade® ) is a bivalent iron chelator which is taken orally as a tablet , once per day . It is readily absorbed and reaches peak concentration in blood after 1 to 2 hours . The half-life is 12 to 17 hours , and effective levels of active chelator are maintained in the blood for more than 24 hours . The drug is eliminated via the hepatobiliary system . The dose varies from 10 mg/kg/day in patients with mild iron overload to 30 mg/kg/day in patients with overt iron toxicity . Adverse events ( AEs ) of deferasirox . The most frequent adverse clinical events are gastrointestinal disturbances and skin rash . The most frequent laboratory side effects are mild increase in serum creatinine and liver transaminases . The adverse events have for the most part been reported in patients with transfusional iron overload . In HC patients the data are more scarce due to the very few studies that have been performed in this group . Other common AEs include headache , constipation , abdominal distension , dyspepsia , pruritus , and proteinuria . Less common AEs include anxiety , sleep disorder , dizziness , early cataract , maculopathy , hearing loss , pharyngolaryngeal pain , gastrointestinal hemorrhage , gastric ulcer , duodenal ulcer , gastritis , oesophagitis , hepatitis , cholelithiasis , pigmentation disorder , renal tubulopathy , glycosuria , pyrexia , edema , and fatigue . Adverse reactions reported during post-marketing experience include pancytopenia , hypersensitivity reaction , hepatic failure , leukocytoclastic vasculitis , urticaria , erythema multiforme , alopecia , acute renal failure , and tubulointerstitial nephritis , gallstones and related biliary disorders , elevations of liver transaminases , and hepatic failure . Any such adverse events will be recorded in the subject 's Case Report Form ( CRF ) . Study design . The study incorporates 4 arms , which will recruit in parallel : Arm 1 : ( open , randomized , comparative ) will consist of 10 patients with confirmed HC , who will be randomized to receive standard treatment with venesection ( withdrawal of 450 mL blood every 8 to 10 days ) . Arm 2 : ( open , randomized , comparative ) will consist of 10 patients with confirmed HC , who will be randomized to receive investigational treatment with deferasirox ( 10 mg/kg orally given once daily ) for a period of 12 months ; Arm 3 : ( open , non-comparative ) will consist of 20 patients with confirmed MDS , all of whom will receive investigational treatment with deferasirox ( initially 10 mg/kg orally given once daily , can be increased to max 40 mg/kg ) for a period of 12 months ; Arm 4 : will consist of 10 healthy volunteers who will undergo the same screening assessments ( i.e . with respect to relevant exclusion criteria ) and will act as non-treated normal controls for comparison of investigational blood tests . The study will be non-blinded . Subjects and investigators will be aware of their subject and treatment arm .

Routine blood and urine tests will be performed for patients at 2,4,6,8 weeks , and thereafter monthly until 12 months and at follow up 4-6 weeks after end of treatment for monitoring the disease , for safety reasons , and to obtain data for comparison traditional biomarkers with the new investigational biomarkers hepcidin and NTBI . Volunteers will undergo all safety assessments plus investigational blood and urine tests . They will not undergo MRI , bone marrow examinations , registrations of transfusions , or active treatment with deferasirox or venesection . Patients with HC or MDS will undergo a follow-up assessment 4 to 6 weeks after last dose . At this visit , all safety assessments and investigational blood and urine tests , including a pregnancy test , will be repeated , but MRI and bone marrow examination will not be performed . Volunteer controls will not attend for this visit . This is an exploratory study with no sample size calculation and no minimum enrollment requirement . It is anticipated that a maximum of 40 patients will be enrolled in order to obtain at least 30 patients fulfilling the study criteria ; 10 volunteers will also be enrolled .",2013-07-01,"January 20, 2017","Inclusion Criteria : Patients with hemochromatosis , aged > 30 years , C282Y- homozygote , with serum-ferritin =/ > 1000 µg/L Patients aged > 18 years with verified low-risk or intermediate-1 risk of myelodysplastic syndrome , with normal cytogenetics and serum-ferritin > 1500 µg/L , or with a transfusion history of =/ > red- blood-cell-transfusions .

R-DHAP consists of a monoclonal antibody called Rituximab and chemotherapy consisting of Dexamethasone , high dose Cytarabine , often called Ara-C , and platinum based chemotherapy , either cisplatinum , or , if treatment with cisplatinum is contraindicated , carboplatinum .","This is a phase 1/2 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lenalidomide added to a standard chemotherapy regime of R-DHAP ( Rituximab , Dexamethasone , high-dose Cytarabine , Cis/Carboplatinum ) in the treatment of relapsed or refractory high-grade B-cell non-hodgkin-lymphoma ( NHL ) . The study hypothesis is that the combination of lenalidomide with standard immunochemotherapy will lead to an overall response rate of at least 60 % . In this study , 3 rounds of immunochemotherapy in combination with lenalidomide will be administered . After the first or second round of therapy , peripheral hematopoetic stem cells will be harvested . Consolidation treatment with autologous or allogenic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation is recommended in all patients suitable , but is not part of the study . In phase 1 , up to six cohorts of at least 6 patients each will be treated with the study therapy , with lenalidomide in increasing dosages , to determine the maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) . In phase 2 , 50 patients will be treated with the MTD . Efficacy and safety will be evaluated .",2013-11-14,"January 17, 2018","Inclusion Criteria : Age : 18-70 Risk groups : All risk groups histology : diagnosis or a recurrent or primary progressive aggressive b-cell non-hodgkin lymphoma , in particular follicular lymphoma grade III diffuse large b-cell lymphoma burkitt lymphoma mantle cell lymphoma , blastoid variant aggressive marginal zone lymphoma Performance status : ECOG 0-2 Criteria for women of childbearing potential : Women of childbearing potential have to : understand the teratogenic risk associated with the study therapy , especially lenalidomide understand the need of reliable , uninterrupted birth control from 4 weeks prior to the start of the study drug , during the duration of the study treatment , and 4 weeks after completion of study treatment , and be able to reliably use birth control , except if the patient commits to absolute sexual abstinence , confirmed on a monthly basis The following are effective methods of contraception : implant levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system ( IUS ) medroxyprogesterone acetate depot tubal sterilisation sexual intercourse with a vasectomised male partner only , vasectomy must be confirmed by two negative semen analyses ovulation-inhibitory progesterone-only pills If not established on effective contraception , the female subject must be referred to an appropriately trained health care professional for contraceptive advice in order that contraception can be initiated .

In the proposed study , residents of the sanatorium at the Mount Horeb Prayer Center located in Mamfe , Ghana will be screened for psychiatric disorders by a psychiatrist . Those who are diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder requiring treatment ( schizophrenia , or mood disorder ) and who meet the other inclusion criteria ( see below ) will be randomly assigned to receive a daily dose of the appropriate psychotropic drug ( according to standard procedures of care ) as well as regular prayer camp treatment ( intervention group ) or to receive only regular prayer camp treatment ( control group ) . After randomization , the patients in the intervention group will receive the bundled treatment for 6 weeks , while control group patients will receive regular prayer camp treatment , e.g . encouragement to pray . Psychiatrists blinded to group assignments will assess outcomes over a 6 - 8 week period . Following this , patients will be referred for continued care with health care facilities as close to their homes as possible on discharge and if they so desire . At the start of the intervention , pastors and attendants at the prayer camp will be qualitatively assessed through a semi-structured interview concerning their attributions of mental illness causation . They will be assessed -0 , -6 weeks after and again -12 weeks after intervention . The investigators hypothesize that patients who receive the bundled intervention will have improved mental health outcomes and functioning and that prayer camp staff will develop more positive attitudes toward conventional medicine and will begin to conceptualize mental health disorders as treatable illnesses , rather than only as a spiritual disorder . The results will provide empirical evidence for or against an integrated model of community based care which encompasses the medical and spiritual . This is the first intervention study in Sub-Saharan Africa to promote the use of psychotropic drugs in a traditional or spiritual healing setting . Its findings may inform the implementation of national policies governing collaboration between primary health care and faith healing centers , expanding access to and improving the quality of mental health care services .",2013-11-25,"October 30, 2015","Inclusion Criteria : > 18 years , < 70 Will benefit from treatment Not suffering from physical condition Resident at the prayer camp Not likely to be discharged from camp within six weeks Speaks either English or twi Able to give consent Not already on medication Exclusion Criteria : likely to be discharged within 6 weeks of commencement of medication Patients already on medication",139,0,18 Years,70 Years
