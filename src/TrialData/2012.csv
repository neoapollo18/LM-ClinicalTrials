For the alternative regimen ( hydroxyurea ) to be declared superior to the standard treatment regimen ( observation ) , the hydroxyurea-treated group must have a three-fold reduction in the incidence of conversion to abnormal TCD velocities ( ≥ 200 cm/sec ) , compared to the standard treatment arm .","Results from previous studies confirm an increased risk of stroke among children with conditional TCD velocities . In addition , studies suggest that patients who were on observation alone , converted from conditional TCD ( moderate risk category ) to an abnormal TCD ( with a much higher risk for primary stroke ) within 30 months of initial identification of the conditional TCD velocity ; this conversion led to initiation of chronic and indefinite transfusions in all cases . Preliminary data suggests that the risk of conversion to abnormal TCD velocities will be lower for subjects with conditional TCD velocities on hydroxyurea by at least three-fold . This important difference in conversion risk rate suggests that an alternative treatment could have a substantial and beneficial impact on patients with elevated TCD velocities . An alternative treatment could protect the brain of patients with SCA and conditional TCD velocities who are at increased risk for stroke .

Wills Eye,NCT01533376,Treatment of Port-wine Mark in Sturge-Weber Syndrome Using Topical Timolol,Wills Eye,1,0,Sturge Weber Syndrome,Drug,Timolol,Treatment,Single,Primary Objective : • To assess the possible utility of topical timolol in the management of port-wine mark ( PWM ) in Sturge-Weber syndrome in children .,"Port-wine mark ( PWM ) represents a congenital capillary malformation , characterized by dilation and malformation of dermal capillaries that lack endothelial proliferation . It is frequently seen in the facial distribution of the trigeminal nerve . PWM persists throughout life and involves ~0.3 % of the population . Although PWMs are found in other circumstances , ~ 3 % of patients with facial PWM are also afflicted with Sturge-Weber syndrome . PWMs are cosmetic entities that often have serious social consequences , producing psychological trauma to both children and their parents . PWM does not involute with time , and , if left untreated , can develop deep purple coloration , tissue hypertrophy , and nodularity . Laser therapy , which selectively destroys specific targets within the skin , is currently the most commonly used approach for treating PWM , although complete blanching of the PWM after laser is rarely achieved for most patients , and only 10-45 % of patients with Sturge-Weber have shown satisfactory outcomes . Complications of pulsed dye laser treatment for PWM include pyogenic granuloma , scabbing , cutaneous scarring , and permanent hypo/hyperpigmentation . Laser treatment is relatively contraindicated in children with darker skin coloration due to the resulting hypopigmentation which may be equally unsightly . Laser treatment causes substantial discomfort and pain to patients , and often requires general anesthesia in children . This is particularly true since earlier treatment in infancy is desirable and yields increased successful resolution of the PWM . The hypertrophic PWM in later years is resistant to any treatment . Recently , propranolol was reported to successfully treat capillary hemangioma in infants.13 While the mechanism by which beta blockade improves hemangioma is unclear , ß2-mediated vasoconstrictive effects and the ensuing apoptosis of capillary endothelial cells may contribute to the positive therapeutic results . Oral application of propranolol can cause severe systemic complications , including bronchospasm , vasospasm , hypoglycemia , hypotension , severe bradycardia , heart block , and congestive heart failure . Topical timolol solution , a β-blocker , has shown a similar ability to reduce capillary hemangioma of eyelids with little or no systemic effects in a small pilot study . Similar to capillary hemangioma , which is a proliferative lesion characterized by increased endothelial cell turnover , PWM is a capillary malformation with abnormal endothelial cells and large surface area of dilated capillaries . Thus , both capillary hemangioma and PWM share the similar characteristic of abnormal capillary endothelial cells . This pilot study is designed to explore the potential role of topical timolol in the management of PWM . As PWM is so frequently associated with Sturge-Weber syndrome , a disorder in which approximately 50 % of patients will develop glaucoma , this study will be conducted in an ophthalmology setting . This study will consist of two arms . One group will receive timolol and the second group a placebo preservative free artificial tear gel . The groups will be divided with a ratio of 1:1 and the Timolol group will be matched with the placebo group by PWM location , age and race . Both medications are to be applied and rubbed in by fingertip to the treatment site twice a day for 6 months by subject 's parents/guardian . ( Treatment site : 1x1 cm at inferior edge of facial PWM ) Follow-up schedule : 1 week after treatment initiation and then every 2 months for a period of six months .",2012-02-11,"March 19, 2019","Inclusion criteria : Age from 2 years to 10 years Port-Wine Mark English fluent and literate substitute decision maker Substitute decision maker vision sufficient to read informed consent document Exclusion criteria : Active ocular infection ( conjunctivitis , keratitis , ) History of systemic conditions including hypo/hypertension , hypoglycemia , bradycardia , asthma or any contraindication to beta blocker use Unable to comply with required follow-up Substitute decision maker not English fluent or not literate Substitute decision maker unable to read consent document Patient already using systemic beta-blocker or beta-agonist ( Patients already using topical beta-blocker for glaucoma will not be excluded from study ) .",3,0,2 Years,10 Years

The improvement of sleep quality and the quality of life will be measured .,"Nocturia is one of the commonest urinary symptoms in elderly and in patients with obstructive sleep apnoea ( OSA ) . According to the International Continence Society ( ICS ) definition , nocturia is defined as `` the complaint that the individual has to wake at night one or more times to void '' . It implies a continuum beginning from what might be considered normal , to a bothersome state . Bothersome nocturia is a common and age-dependent condition . A prevalence ranging from 48.6 % to 77 % were reported in the literature . Pathogenesis of nocturia is multi-factorial , and has closely related to OSA . OSA patients generate negative intrathoracic pressure during sleep , this leads to increased venous return and distension of the right atrium . This leads to an increase of hormone secretion , namely Atrial Natriuretic Peptide ( ANP ) . ANP causes increased sodium and water excretion , and inhibits the secretion of antidiuretic hormone . All of the above factors results in an increased nocturnal urine production and nocturia . Middle-aged men with OSA always present to urology clinic with lower urinary tract symptoms with predominant nocturia . Many a time they were treated as benign prostatic hyperplasia with multiple medications with suboptimal response . The underlying genuine pathology of OSA-related nocturia is overlooked . Desmopressin is an analogue of antidiuretic hormone , it is the pharmacological therapy of choice for patients with nocturia where night-time polyuria is present . In this study , the investigators would like to evaluate the efficacy of desmopressin on symptoms of nocturia in patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnoea ( OSA ) .

S.p.A.,3,0,Ulcerative Colitis,Drug,Propionyl-L-Carnitine,Treatment,Quadruple,"The aim of the trial is to test safety , tolerability and efficacy of Propionyl-L-carnitine modified release tablets 1g/die in reducing the symptoms of the disease with respect to the proportion of patients with disease remission at the end of the 8 weeks of treatment . It will also aim to investigate capability of the treatment in the maintenance of remission after four weeks of treatment interruption ; histological changes will be also evaluated and finally , improvement in the overall quality of life as measured by the Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire ( SIBDQ ) will be investigated .","Although it seems clear that an abnormal function of the colonic epithelium is the central problem causing inflammation and the unusual immunological response to the normal gut flora in inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) , the actual causes of these dysfunctions are still unknown . Short Chain Fatty Acids ( SCFA ) are the main fuel of the colonic epithelium , and are normally produced by the bacterial flora by fermentation of the complex carbohydrates forming non soluble fibers usually introduced with everyday diet . Butyrate alone contributes 70 % of the normal colonocyte energy . Studies done using animal models and colonic mucosa biopsies from patients suffering form ulcerative colitis ( UC ) have consistently shown that a metabolic change occurs in diseased colonic mucosa , with an impairment of butyrate oxidation ( and of beta-oxidation ) and an energy shortage that is only incompletely compensated by oxidation of glucose and other substrates such as glutamine . It is also well known that matrix metalloproteases production is highly increased in IBD and that serum transglutaminase activity is significantly reduced in patients with IBD . Transglutaminases are enzymes contributing to the crosslinking of matrix proteins and the reduction seen in patients affected by IBD correlates well with the endoscopic and histopathologic grading in UC , meaning that part of the circulating enzyme is sequestered in the injured colonic tissue in the effort to re-build the extracellular matrix during the healing process . Propionyl-L-carnitine Hydrochloride ( PLC ) is a molecule that has already been shown to reduce membrane lipid peroxidation in endothelial cells from bovine aorta and coronary vessels , to reduce the effects of hypoxia in coronary endothelial cells , and to play a role in the cardiac metabolic abnormalities that contribute to the mechanical dysfunctions leading to heart failure . Given these properties of Propionyl-L-carnitine Hydrochloride ( ST 261 ) and given the peroxidative damage suffered by colonocytes in UC together with their metabolic impairment , the use of this molecule for the treatment of UC seemed to be appropriate and sound , in particular as a carrier of a propionate moiety that , once transformed into succinate , enters the Kreb cycle , acting as an extra burst fuel improving the balance of energy production inside tissues . Previous clinical experience has shown that PLC promoted complete or nearly complete regression of cutaneous trophic ulcers in a large number of vasculopathic patients refractory to all other therapies . As far as the UC pathology is concerned , the effects of ST 261 , given orally or intrarectally , were investigated at different dosages , in preclinical experimentation , either after a single trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid ( TNBS ) administration ( acute colitis ) or after repeated TNBS administrations ( reactivated colitis ) . The results showed a reduction in the damaged colon area both in acute model and reactivated colitis , even if the beneficial effect of restoration of TNBS-induced alterations of tissue morphology is more evident in the reactivated colitis model , particularly after oral administration . Based on the above-described results a development plan in humans started to investigate the activity of PLC in the treatment of ulcerative colitis .",2012-02-20,"November 4, 2016","Inclusion Criteria : Have read the Information for the Patient and signed the Informed Consent Form .

In these patients there is also an increased risk of systemic relapse due to the advanced stage of the tumor as well as a higher possibility of having positive margins . Therefore , the treatment of these patients need to be decided based on a multidisciplinary strategy . Besides of that the use of systemic neoadjuvant chemotherapy as induction therapy , followed by sequential chemoradiotherapy is a very attractive therapeutic modality . The neoadjuvant treatment offers the potential advantages of reducing the tumor stage , increasing resectability and decreasing postoperative complications . The administration of chemotherapy and radiotherapy before surgery represent an strategy for early treatment of micrometastatic disease , present in most of these patients , and to identify patients with rapid progression of the disease .

University of Washington,NCT01524705,FLuctuATion Reduction With inSULin and Glp-1 Added togetheR (FLAT-SUGAR),University of Washington,4,1,Type 2 Diabetes,Drug,"""GLIPULIN:"" [insulin glargine, metformin, exenatide (GLP-1-agonist)]",Treatment,,"Results of recent studies using standard long and short acting insulin therapy ( Basal - Bolus or BBI ) in type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) have not shown benefits to lower risks for heart attacks , strokes , or eye , nerve and kidney problems . Some studies also show a long time between the start of treatment and signs of benefit . This has led to a review of current ways to normalize blood glucose control with basal bolus insulin and how to make blood glucose better . Improving blood sugar with insulin therapy usually causes weight gain , more high sugar levels after meals , and more low blood sugars . Early studies suggest that when people take long-acting insulin and metformin , they have fewer blood sugar extremes when they also take a new type of medicine called glucagon-like polypeptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) agonist named exenatide ( Byetta ) , instead of meal-time insulin . This means there might be a better way to treat Type 2 diabetes . Participants are asked to take part in an eight month study to find out if middle-aged and older people with Type 2 diabetes who have added risk factors for heart disease can even out their blood sugar levels . They will start on long-acting insulin , mealtime insulin , and metformin , if they are not already on these medications . Their kidney function tests must be normal and they must not be allergic to metformin . Then , after a 2 month run-in phase , they must be willing to be assigned by chance into one of two groups . This means that they will have a 50/50 chance ( like flipping a coin ) of being in either group . Half of them will be started on the new medicine known as Byetta rather than the meal-time insulin and the other half will remain on the meal-time insulin during the next 6 months ( 26 weeks ) to see which group has more steady blood sugars . They will be asked to use a continuous blood sugar monitoring system called DexCom . A sensor is inserted under the skin in the same areas the insulin is injected . The DexCom can check their blood sugars 24 hours of the day and night and will be worn until 7 days of recordings are collected . In the same 7 day period , they will also be asked to wear a Holter or Telemetry monitor that will record their heart beats and rhythm which will be compared to the blood sugar readings . They will also use home glucose meters to check their glucose levels about 3 to 4 times a day . The study will take place at 12 centers in the United States and enroll about 120-130 people .","Recent medical endpoint studies employing conventional basal bolus insulin therapy ( BBI ) in type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) have been disappointing , showing either inconsistent or no effect of treatments on risks for micro- or macro-vascular events , or a long interval between treatment initiation and evidence of clinical benefit . In fact , one trial has suggested that treating glycosylated hemoglobin ( HbA1C ) to lower targets may even lead to harm . This has raised the possibility that more aggressive glucose lowering approaches lead to harm that overwhelms benefit in those with T2DM . Potential explanations for these results include three closely related physiologic processes : glycemic variability , weight gain and hypoglycemia . Too much variability of glucose , especially post-prandial hyperglycemia , poses the dilemma of how to achieve near-normal mean glucose and HbA1C levels without causing insulin-induced hypoglycemia and/or weight gain . All three of these processes have been linked to worsening systemic inflammation and oxidative stress , and to increased renal and cardiovascular risks . Fortunately , new tools are available that allow us to assess the severity of glycemic variability ( continuous glucose monitoring , or CGM ) , and to investigate the mechanisms through which it may lead to cardiovascular risk ( e.g. , systemic inflammation and oxidative stress , sensitive measures of diabetic renal disease , and Holter or Telemetry monitoring for hypoglycemia-induced arrhythmias ) . In addition , preliminary studies have suggested that replacement of rapid-acting analogue ( RAA ) in traditional BBI with the glucagon-like polypeptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) agonist , exenatide , may substantially reduce glycemic variability without a strong tendency to increase body weight or hypoglycemia . This research trial , `` FLuctuATion reduction with inSUlin and Glp-1 Added togetheR ( FLAT-SUGAR ) '' , by using these new methods to optimize glycemic control while limiting unwanted adverse effects , will be a definitive comparative effectiveness trial . This trial is designed to address the following primary hypothesis : In middle aged and older individuals with T2DM and additional risk factors for cardiovascular disease , and on a background therapy of basal insulin ( insulin glargine ) and metformin , the addition of the GLP-1 analogue , exenatide , reduces glycemic variability more than the addition of a rapid-acting-analogue ( RAA ) ( insulin aspart , insulin glulisine or insulin lispro ) during an active treatment period of 26 weeks . The primary outcome measure will be the change in the coefficient of variation of continuous glucose readings , as assessed by CGM . Importantly , FLAT-SUGAR will plan , a priori , to assess glycemic variability using CGM . Secondary trial goals will be to explore potential between-group differences in complications that may result from glycemic variability , including hypoglycemia , systemic inflammation and oxidant stress , diabetic renal disease , weight gain and cardiac arrhythmias . If , as we expect , FLAT-SUGAR demonstrates that CGM provides objective verification of reduced glycemic variability in T2DM with the new GLP-1 agonist-based regimen , the main goal of the trial will be accomplished . If reduced variability is associated with lower risks of adverse events of inflammation , albuminuria progression , weight gain , hypoglycemia , and/or cardiac arrhythmia , a long term clinical comparative effectiveness trial powered to evaluate medical outcomes will be justified . In order to conduct FLAT-SUGAR , a randomized , controlled , multicenter , open-label investigator-initiated trial , the primary funding is supported by Sanofi-Aventis US with donations of other medications and devices by several other companies . The Sponsor-Investigator is the University of Washington , which will also be the Operation Center ( OC ) .The Data Center ( DC ) is the University of Texas at Houston School of Public Health .

The results of this research will help determine if atomoxetine alters signs of inflammation and other biomarkers associated with Alzheimer 's disease .","The Alzheimer 's Disease ( AD ) epidemic is a looming crisis , with an urgent need for new therapies to delay or prevent symptom onset and progression . Advances in AD biomarker research have demonstrated changes in amyloid , brain metabolism , and other pathophysiologies prior to the onset of memory loss , with some markers possibly changing one or two decades earlier . Since MCI coincides with the onset of brain atrophy , this early stage of AD pathogenesis may offer a critical window of time to initiate novel therapies aimed at the secondary wave of events that lead to progressive neurodegeneration . From recently emerged basic research in animal models of AD : loss of norepinephrine ( NE ) incites a pro-inflammatory condition that is neurotoxic and reduces Aß clearance , and remarkably , rescue of norepinephrine reverses these effects and slows neurodegeneration .

"Insel Gruppe AG, University Hospital Bern",NCT01522105,Daptomycin in Pediatric Patients With Bacterial Meningitis,"Insel Gruppe AG, University Hospital Bern",1,0,Meningitis,Drug,Daptomycin,Treatment,,5 Children > 3months and < 16 years with Gram-positive meningitis will receive a single dose of daptomycin 24 hours after the first dose of ceftriaxone . 4-8 hours after daptomycin administration a second lumbar puncture is performed to determine the peak concentration of daptomycin in the cerebrospinal fluid . In parallel peak and trough level of daptomycin will be measured in the plasma . The investigators anticipate that daptomycin penetrates into the cerebrospinal fluid in bactericidal concentrations,"Background Acute bacterial meningitis is a severe infection , which leads to persistent neurological deficits in up to 50 % of patients , despite optimal medical treatment . Although , the incidence of acute bacterial meningitis has declined in developed countries since the advent of vaccines against Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae , this is not yet true for developing countries . Also , the impact of serotype replacement in invasive pneumococcal disease can not be estimated to date . Acute bacterial meningitis causes brain injury most prominently in the cerebral cortex , the inner ear and in the hippocampus . In the hippocampus , a brain region functionally important for learning and memory , the brain damage is characterized by apoptosis of cells in the hippocampal dentate gyrus . Autopsy studies demonstrated the occurrence of apoptosis in neurons of the hippocampal dentate gyrus in the majority ( > 75 % ) of human autopsy cases , who died of acute bacterial meningitis . Children are particularly vulnerable to this form of brain damage because of ongoing development of neurological functions and they have a higher risk of neurologic deficits after bacterial meningitis than adults . The 3 most common pathogens in childhood meningitis are Streptococcus pneumoniae , Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria meningitidis . Streptococcus pneumoniae is associated with the greatest risk for fatal outcome or persistent neurological deficits . In the most recent prospective study hearing loss was the most common major sequelae in half of the patients , followed by cognitive deficits ( 40.0 % ) , seizures ( 21.2 % ) , and motor deficits ( 21.2 % ) ; one third of these patients had multiple defects.The pathogenesis of brain damage in meningitis is driven by the host 's owns inflammatory reaction to the invading pathogens in the subarachnoid space . This inflammatory reaction is triggered by the release of subcapsular bacterial components . Unfortunately , β-lactam antibiotics , current standard of care in bacterial meningitis , induce bacteriolysis leading to a brisk accumulation of subcapsular bacterial components in the cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) , which in turn trigger an over-shooting inflammatory reaction contributing to brain damage . First evaluated more than 50 years ago , adjunctive corticosteroids still are the only approved therapy to minimize this inflammatory reaction in humans . In children the benefit of a combination therapy with dexamethasone and ceftriaxone has only been proven in the reduction of permanent hearing loss after Haemophilus influenzae type b meningitis , a pathogen that today is virtually eradicated in regions that implemented the vaccination . Furthermore , the beneficial effects of dexamethasone administration in meningitis have been challenged repeatedly . A recent prospective study and two meta-analyses show conflicting results considering the benefit of adjuvant corticosteroid treatment for neurological outcome in children with acute bacterial meningitis . Furthermore , adjunctive corticosteroid treatment does not seem to benefit patients with acute bacterial meningitis in developing countries . Even more worrying are results in experimental meningitis , which indicate that dexamethasone might lead to neuronal injury . Daptomycin ( Cubicin¨ , Novartis Pharma AG , Basel Switzerland ) is a cyclic lipopeptide antimicrobial agent active against most Gram-positive bacteria including strains that are resistant to methicillin , vancomycin or linezolid . It binds to the membrane of Gram-positive bacteria and causes rapid depolarization of membrane potential leading to bacterial cell death . Thereby , daptomycin exerts a bactericidal , but non-bacteriolytic effect and does not cause release of subcapsular bacterial components . Recently , it has been proven for experimental pneumococcal meningitis that daptomycin leads to a substantially reduced inflammatory reaction compared to ceftriaxone . Additionally , it has been shown that compared to ceftriaxone monotherapy , daptomycin plus ceftriaxone lowers the levels of pro-inflammatory mediators in the cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) and reduces brain damage in the form of hippocampal apoptosis and hearing loss in infant rat pneumococcal meningitis . Based on the experimental data summarized above , it appears reasonable to assume that the use of daptomycin , followed by the administration of a broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent in children with pneumococcal meningitis , or other Gram-positive meningitis , would lead to a reduced inflammatory response and , ultimately , to a reduced incidence of permanent neurological deficits . While it has been established that the pharmacokinetics ( PK ) of daptomycin in children are age-dependent 6 , only scarce data exist on the extent of penetration of daptomycin into the inflamed CSF . Anecdotal evidence indicates that in humans with inflamed meninges daptomycin penetrates into the CSF in sufficient amounts . This is supported by animal studies . There are currently two pediatric studies ongoing in the United States of America . DAP-PEDS- 09-01 will assess pharmacokinetics ( PK ) and safety of Daptomycin in 18 children ages 3-24 months with Gram-positive bacterial infections . DAP-PEDS-07-03 will assess efficacy and safety of multiple daptomycin doses in 339 children aged 2 - 17 years with skin and skin structures infections . Design and dosing of both studies are based on previous findings in two pediatric studies involving 25 children ages 2-17 years and 12 children ages 2-6 years . None of these studies will or has investigated daptomycin penetration into the CSF . As a first step to establishing optimal dosing recommendations for daptomycin in pediatric patients with meningitis , the present pharmacokinetic study attempts to document adequate CSF penetration of daptomycin in children with acute bacterial meningitis . Objective Characterize the extent to which daptomycin penetrates into the CSF of children with acute bacterial meningitis . Because determination of AUC in the CSF is not feasible , Cmax of daptomycin in the CSF will be taken as a surrogate marker Methods Children between the ages of 3 months to 16 years with acute bacterial meningitis will be recruited . After obtaining baseline blood parameters including muscular enzymes , renal function , hepatic function , and blood cultures , a lumbar puncture is performed and standard of care therapy with ceftriaxone 100mg/kg ( top dose 4g i.v . ) is initiated . 24 hours after hospitalisation a single dose of daptomycin at an age- dependent dosage , is administered i.v . over 15 min . shortly before or after the second dose of ceftriaxone . 4-8 hours after daptomycin administration a second lumbar puncture is performed to obtain a CSF sample for measurement of peak daptomycin levels . Serum concentrations of daptomycin are measured immediately after i.v . administration , at the time of lumbar puncture and 24 hours after daptomycin administration . Daptomycin therapy is discontinued after one dose , while standard of care antimicrobial therapy is continued for a total of 7 to 10 days .",2012-01-26,"October 9, 2018","Inclusion Criteria : Age > 3 months and < 16 years Bacterial meningitis Written parental ( or appropriate legal representative ) informed consent prior to study inclusion Exclusion Criteria Gram-negative bacteria in the CSF Creatinine clearance 2x upper age related norm Known allergy or hypersensitivity to daptomycin Known clinical significant cardiovascular , pulmonary , renal , hepatic , gastrointestinal , endocrine , hematologic , autoimmune disease , or primary immunodeficiency Height and weight below 3rd or above 95th percentile History of , or current muscular disease Underlying neurological disease with disruption of blood brain barrier Epilepsy Muscular weakness , history of peripheral neuropathy , or Guillain-Barré syndrome",1,0,3 Months,16 Years

Can the radiolabelled antibody be shown to effectively target the bone marrow in these patients . If it can , could this result in better outcomes after transplantation .","The aim of this clinical research study is to establish whether a radiolabelled antibody can be used to safely deliver radiotherapy to the bone marrow prior to stem cell transplantation for haematological malignancies . With current chemotherapy regimens 60-90 % of adult patients with acute leukaemia ( AML and ALL ) achieve a complete remission . However in a significant proportion of these patients the disease will recur . Although allogeneic and autologous bone marrow or peripheral blood haematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) are established as effective treatment options for haematological malignancies , resulting in long term disease free survival in a significant proportion of patients , the results of transplantation for patients with poor risk disease are disappointing . Further intensification of the treatment used prior to transplantation has been shown to reduce the risk of relapse , but the toxicity of the drugs or external beam radiotherapy causes an increase in transplant related deaths . The introduction of reduced intensity conditioning protocols allows the use of HSCT for older patients or those with significant additional medical problems but retrospective analysis indicates an increased rate of relapse . This is the 'Transplantation dilemma ' - how to reduce the risk of disease relapse by intensifying therapy , but without an increase in toxicity to other organs causing an increase in transplant related deaths in remission . Normal haematopoietic tissue and the malignant cells arising from it are very radiosensitive . Theoretically intensification of the conditioning therapy , particularly total body irradiation ( TBI ) , prior to transplantation could increase tumour reduction leading to improved disease free survival rates for patients with poor risk disease . Targeted radiotherapy could allow treatment intensification without the toxicity to non-haematological tissues . In addition , the continuous , low dose rate delivered by the natural decay of a targeted radionuclide may have a greater destructive effect upon tumour cells than single dose or fractionated external beam radiation .",2012-01-26,"April 5, 2019","Inclusion Criteria : An underlying haematological malignancy including acute myeloid leukaemia in first complete remission ( CR1 ) but with poor prognostic features or in > CR1 or in relapse ; acute lymphoblastic leukaemia ; transformed myelodysplasia , chronic myeloid leukaemia ( accelerated phase or blast transformation , poor response or intolerance of tyrosine kinase inhibitors ) , myeloma .

An autologous blood transfusion is when a person donates blood and then receives that same blood back in the transfusion . We also want to find out if in this situation inhaled nitric oxide can help to prevent the potential reduction of vasodilation capacity . Vasodilation capacity is the ability of the blood vessel to widen when needed .,"The objective of this study is to assess effects of the storage of PRBC on pulmonary vasoconstriction measured as increase in pulmonary artery pressure and endothelial function measured as a change in reactive hyperemia index in overweight people with existing endothelial dysfunction at baseline . The present study consists of three different parts , which will be scheduled in a randomized order on the same subject ( crossover study ) . During one phase of the study , 14 healthy human volunteers will donate a unit of Packed Red Blood Cells ( PRBC ) , which will be leukoreduced and stored in Additive Solutions-1 ( AS-1 ) , and then transfused back to the subjects after 3 days of storage at 4º C in the MGH Blood Bank ( Fresh Blood arm ) . The second part of the study consists in the collection of another unit of PRBC from the same volunteers which will be transfused back to them after 40 days of storage ( Old Blood arm ) . Finally in the third part , like in the second one , one unit of PRBC will be withdraw and stored for 40 days , but 80 ppm ( parts per million by volume ) Nitric Oxide in air will be administered together with the transfusion . There will be a 2 weeks interval after each PRBC transfusion . We hypothesize that old red blood cells stored under conventional conditions may trigger a complex , pro-inflammatory , pro-thrombotic and vasoconstriction response . We will compare the response to PRBC stored for 3 days with the response to PRBC stored for 40 days in the same healthy volunteers .

Fibroids occur in 20-50 % of women over 30 years of age , and with increasing size can produce pain , menorrhagia , pressure , bloating and urinary and bowel compression symptoms . Fibroids may also cause infertility . Symptomatic fibroids impact health and well-being of the female including lost work hours and reduced quality of life . Current medical treatments include invasive removal of the fibroid ( hysterectomy , myomectomy ) , drug therapy , or treatments causing necrosis of the fibroid tissue such as ablation ( freezing or heating ) or embolization . It has been estimated that 600,000 hysterectomies are performed per year in the United States and more than half of the conducted hysterectomies are due to fibroids . For the relief of symptoms , women wishing to preserve the uterus may choose between invasive procedures of myomectomy , Uterine Artery Embolization ( UAE ) , ablation or cryotherapy . The surgically invasive procedures require anesthesia , hospital stays , and long recovery periods .

Sf2aWC is a killed vaccine that is being made to prevent disease from Shigella. , which causes bloody , watery diarrhea . Infants and children living in developing countries experience the greatest consequences of this disease . The purpose of this study is to find a dose of the vaccine that is safe , tolerable , and develops an immune response . About 82 healthy adults , ages 18-45 , will participate in this study . This study will require volunteers to stay in the research facility for several nights for the first dose . Participants in Cohorts 2 , 3 , and 4 will not be required to stay overnight for the second and third doses . Participants will be assigned to receive 1 of 4 vaccine doses by mouth . Study procedures include : stool samples , blood samples and documenting side effects . Participants will be involved in study related procedures for about 8 months .","Despite the public health burden of Shigella spp . on travelers , deployed soldiers and , most significantly , young children in the developing world , there is no licensed vaccine against Shigella . The rationale for using Shigella flexneri 2a whole cell killed vaccine ( Sf2aWC ) , is that it is expected to be especially well tolerated by subjects . If Sf2aWC is safe and immunogenic , it may be combined with S. sonnei and S. flexneri 3a as the basis of a multivalent vaccine , because these three components should cover up to 80 % of shigella infections in developing countries and over 90 % in developed countries . This is a single site , Phase 1 , double-blind , randomized , placebo-controlled , dose-escalation study in healthy adult subjects . Approximately 82 subjects will be enrolled into four separate cohorts and will be randomized to receive Sf2aWC or placebo . The placebo preparation will be bicarbonate buffer . Cohort 1 subjects will receive a single oral dose of Sf2aWC ( 2.6±0.8 x 10^8 vp/mL ) or placebo .

Cohorts 2 , 3 , and 4 participants will receive three doses of Sf2aWC vaccine or placebo at 0 , 1 and 2 months . The first immunization will be administered in the CIR inpatient unit , followed by 72 hours of direct post-immunization observation . If after review by the SRC the first dose appears safe and well tolerated , subsequent doses will be administered on an outpatient basis . Safety will be assessed by solicited symptoms/subject memory aid and laboratory evaluations . Adverse events ( AE ) s will be graded according to standardized criteria . The immunogenicity outcome measures of interest include serum immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) and immunoglobulin A ( IgA ) antibodies by ELISA against S. flexneri 2a Lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) and S. flexneri 2a invasive protein antigens ( Ipa ) , cytokine assays , B and T cell memory responses , and vaccine-specific IgA responses . The proposed sample size of twenty per group in Cohorts 2 , 3 , and 4 would be sufficient to select the appropriate dose to move into the next study phase , providing that a difference in the immunogenicity between the two arms is 20 % or greater .

Polyethylene glycol electrolyte solutions ( PEG-E ) are the most commonly used laxatives in China . However , a significant number of patients , especially those constipated patients , failed colonoscopies due to poor bowel cleaning . Inadequate preparation may also lead to missed colonic lesions . The study is based on the hypothesis : itopride hydrochloride , a prokinetic agent , its dual role as dopamine D2 receptor antagonism and acetylcho-linesterase inhibition make it an appropriate adjuvant for bowel preparation . It was reported to promote colonic peristalsis , shorten colonic transit time and accelerate propulsion of colonic luminal contents through inhibition of M3 receptor and dopamine D2 receptors in vitro and in vivo .

However , LT does not cure the infection , and therapeutic strategies resulted in very limited efficacy and tolerability in LT recipients . In view of its postulated safety profile , Silibinin seems an ideal drug to be used in the setting of HCV recurrent patients after liver transplantation .","Hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) -related liver disease continues to be the most common indication for liver transplantation ( LT ) in both the United States and Europe . However , LT does not cure the infection , and re-infection of the liver allograft universally occurs . Recurrent HCV hepatitis often follows an accelerated course after LT , and histological recurrence occurs in approximately 50 % of patients within 1 year after LT ; 15-30 % of them develop cirrhosis within 5 years . In this context , a peculiar feature is represented by the rapid course of liver fibrosis . Therapeutic strategies for managing the primary cause of liver damage , i.e . HCV infection , irrespective of application in pre- , peri- , and/or post-LT periods resulted in very limited efficacy and tolerability in LT recipients . In view of its postulated safety profile , Silibinin seems an ideal drug to be used in the setting of HCV recurrent patients after liver transplantation . Silibinin , a flavonolignan representing the main component ( 60 % ) of Silymarin and proposed as an anti-hepatotoxic agent for the treatment of various liver diseases has been recently reported to beneficially modulate the pro-fibrogenic potential of HSC , thus representing a very attractive possibility in the transplanted population . Besides the anti-inflammatory properties , Silibinin is able to inhibit Tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-α ) . This is a proinflammatory cytokine with a major role in both acute and chronic viral , bacterial and fungal infections .

Secondary objectives include : To evaluate the safety and toxicity of the study treatment by common toxicity criteria ( CTC ; version 4.0 ) . To assess the response rates at 6 months ( continuous complete response = CCR , complete response = CR , partial response = PR , stable disease = SD , progressive disease = PD ) and progression-free survival ( PFS ) at 6 months , and response rates , OS , and PFS at 12 months after relapse diagnosis or diagnosis of tumor progression . Response will be presented including histopathological variants . To assess the pharmacokinetics of cilengitide administered as part of the study treatment . Indication and study population for this trial : Treatment of relapsed or refractory high grade gliomas and diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas in paediatric patients ≥ 3 years and < 18 years of age . Patients included in the study receive Cilengitide 1800 mg/m² i.v . twice weekly Temozolomide 75 mg/m²/d p.o . for 6 weeks , followed by 1 week rest with a mandatory platelet-count dependent dose adaptation rule : mandatory blood counts twice weekely : Platelets ≥ 100 000/µl ( ≥ 100 Gpt/l ) : 75 mg/m² , platelets ≥ 50 000 - < 100 000/µl ( ≥ 50 - < 100 Gpt/l ) : 50 mg/m² , platelets < 50 000/µl ( < 50 Gpt/l ) : stop temozolomide until platelet recovery ≥ 100 000/µl ( ≥100 Gpt/l ) Study treatment in the individual patient is scheduled for 1 year unless tumor progression or excessive toxicity occurs . However , study treatment may be extended beyond 1 year upon individual decision .","Indication : Treatment of relapsed or refractory high grade gliomas and diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas in paediatric patients ≥ 3 years and < 18 years of age . Background and rationale : Relapsed or refractory high-grade gliomas or diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas ( in the following both addressed as high grade gliomas = HGG ) in children and adolescents represent a very bad prognosis group for which a recommended standard salvage therapy is currently not available . The combination of cilengitide and metronomic temozolomide will be investigated in the present trial as new treatment strategy for these patients . Metronomic temozolomide was shown to act via inhibition of tumour angiogenesis and as a cytotoxic agent . Cilengitide might act via tumour angiogenesis and also inhibits tumour cell migration . For both drugs , safe doses with only low toxicity had been defined in phase I trials for paediatric patients with recurrent or refractory brain tumours ( Cilengitide : 1800 mg/m² twice weekly ; metronomic Temozolomide : 75-80 mg/m²/d in a 6 week schedule followed by one week rest ) In a phase II trial for adult patients with relapsed glioblastoma cilengitide as single agent showed a trend towards higher efficacy with 2000 mg twice weekly as compared to 500 mg twice weekly . Furthermore , in a phase II trial of newly diagnosed adult glioblastoma patients , signs of clinical activity of cilengitide in combination with radiotherapy and conventional temozolomide was seen in the methylated MGMT gene promoter subgroup . Based on these findings , a large randomized phase III trial investigating cilengitide in combination with standard therapy ( temozolomide and radiation ) in this subgroup was started recently . Metronomic temozolomide was also shown to be still effective in glioma patients suffering from relapse after temozolomide standard therapy . Interestingly , the mode of action appears to be widely independent of the MGMT status , probably due to MGMT depletion by continuous treatment . In conclusion , for both drugs signs of clinical activity have been shown in relapsed glioblastoma patients , even after failure of temozolomide standard therapy . Study design : Prospective , non-randomized phase II trial . Study population : Patients 3 years and < 18 years of age with high grade glioma or diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma relapsed after or refractory to standard therapy recruited by approved trial sites Sample size : It is planned to include 33 patients . Therapy : Patients included in the study receive Cilengitide 1800 mg/m² i.v . twice weekly Temozolomide 75 mg/m²/d p.o . for 6 weeks , followed by 1 week rest with a mandatory platelet-count dependent dose adaptation rule : mandatory blood counts twice weekely : Platelets ≥ 100 000/µl ( ≥ 100 Gpt/l ) : 75 mg/m² , platelets ≥ 50 000 - < 100 000/µl ( ≥ 50 - < 100 Gpt/l ) : 50 mg/m² , platelets < 50 000/µl ( < 50 Gpt/l ) : stop temozolomide until platelet recovery ≥ 100 000/µl ( ≥100 Gpt/l ) Study treatment in the individual patient is scheduled for 1 year unless tumor progression or excessive toxicity occurs . However , study treatment may be extended beyond 1 year upon individual decision . Biometry : Statistical analysis and sample size calculation : The feasibility and efficacy of the HIT-HGG-CilMetro therapy will be assessed by a single stage analysis . Sample size calculation is based on the 6 month overall survival rate . This survival rate was found to be 44 % in a historical study population from the HIT-GBM data base . An overall survival rate of 59 % in the present study is considered to be of clinical relevance . Based on a one sided one sample χ2-test and a significance level α=5 % a sample size of 33 patients is planned . This sample size implies a power of 50 % . Schedule : The study is scheduled to start on January 1 , 2012 . The recruitment period for the trial will last 24 months until December 31 , 2013 . Individual follow-up for at least 1 year after study entry is required for this protocol .

Misoprostol , a prostaglandin E1 analogue , is a widely accepted induction agent , that has been proven safe and effective for induction of labor . It stimulates both cervical ripening and uterine contractions , thus making it an ideal induction agent for unfavorable cervices . Research has examined the pharmacokinetics of different administration routes and effects on uterine contractility , side effects , and safety . Vaginal misoprostol has been shown to be superior over oral administration however patients often prefer a more tolerable route . Buccal administration has already been shown to be as effective as vaginal misoprostol for cervical ripening and induction in both first trimester and second trimester abortions . There is minimal research comparing buccal versus vaginal for third trimester induction of labor . The investigators study is a prospective , double blinded , randomized control trial comparing vaginal misoprostol and buccal misoprostol in equal dosages of 25 mcg . The investigators seek to answer the question whether buccal misoprostol is as effective as vaginal misoprostol for third trimester induction of labor .","Design Overview This will be a prospective , double blind , randomized , placebo-controlled trial comparing buccal versus vaginal misoprostol in equal doses ( 25 mcg every 4 hours ) . Each participant will receive one buccal and one vaginal tablet , only one containing misoprostol . The administration will be repeated every four hours if contractions are inadequate ( frequency less than every 5 minutes ) until the cervix is favorable , spontaneous rupture of membranes occurs , or the patient is in active labor . Patient will be continued on intermittent fetal heart monitoring 1 hour after administration . Prior to discharge women in the study will be asked to complete a questionnaire as to their preferences of route of administration and side effects . Recruitment , Consenting , and Confirming Eligibility : Women with obstetric , medical , or psychosocial indications of induction of labor at University of California , Los Angeles Ronald Reagan Medical Center will be evaluated for participation . Those who meet eligibility criteria will be invited to participate . The subject will be counseled about the study , and if interested , will undergo the consent process . Each potential subject will receive a thorough overview of the study protocol and will review the consent form with study staff . All questions will be answered . The subject will be advised that a decision not to participate in the study will not affect the quality or availability of medical services she will receive at the hospital . She will also be advised that she can stop participating in the study at any time , for any reason , and that this will not impact the services she receives . If the subject elects to participate , two copies of the consent will be signed by the subject and research staff . A signed consent , along with a copy of the Experimental Subjects Bill of Rights , will be given to the subject . The other consent will be filed in a locked file cabinet . A general medical and gynecological history and physical will be done as is standard of care . Routine obstetric labs and any other medically indicated labs will be sent as is standard of care . Patients will undergo a non-stress test and uterine contraction monitoring prior to induction of labor . Obstetrical ultrasound will be reviewed or performed if indicated per the physician . Assessment of the cervix and Bishop score , pelvis , fetal size , and presentation will be performed . An unfavorable cervix is defined as Bishop score of 6 or less ( ACOG ) . Women with ruptured membranes will not be able to participate . Gestational age will be determined on the basis of last menstrual period , confirmed by earliest ultrasound , or a corrected estimated date of confinement by the earliest ultrasound . Misoprostol Administration/ Evaluation : The subject will be randomized to either of two groups . Each participant will receive both a vaginal and buccal tablet , with one tablet containing misoprostol . Subjects will be instructed by a nurse regarding buccal placement and to swallow any residue remaining after 20 minutes . Intravaginal administration of pill will be performed by a resident Physician or midwife . The subject will remain recumbent for at least 30 minutes . The subject will undergo fetal heart rate ( FHR ) and uterine contraction monitoring for at least 1 hour after misoprostol administration . The subject may undergo further FHR and uterine contraction monitoring per physician discretion . If the subject does not have adequate uterine contractions ( uterine contraction occurring at least every 5 minutes ) , the same dosage and route of administration regimen will be repeated to 6 maximum dosage ( maximum of 150mcg ) . Cervical assessment of Bishop score will be performed with each treatment during vaginal administration . Treatment will continue until spontaneous rupture of membranes , active labor , or favorable cervix ( Bishop > 6 ) . Augmentation of labor using pitocin may start after 4 hours of last misoprostol dose according to routine protocol . Amniotomy may be performed at the discretion of the managing obstetrician . If labor is not achieved after receiving 150mcg of misoprostol , it will be categorized as a failed induction . At this time , the subject may be offered oxytocin induction , foley bulb mechanical dilation , or cesarean section , according to the fetal and participant condition .

National Institutes of Health Clinical Center (CC),NCT01517100,The Role of Endocannabinoids in Insulin Production and Action,National Institute on Aging (NIA),1,1,Healthy Volunteers,Other,Nabilone,Diagnostic,Double,"Background : - The endocannabinoid system is involved in different body functions and processes . It helps regulate appetite and mood , and sends signals to the nervous system . It may also be involved in how the body produces insulin during digestion . Researchers want to test two drugs that work on the endocannabinoid system : nabilone and CP-945,598 . These drugs may be able to affect insulin levels in the blood . This information may suggest possible new treatments for people with diabetes . Objectives : - To study how the endocannabinoid system is involved in insulin production and action . Eligibility : - Healthy men between 21 and 55 years of age . Design : Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history . They will provide blood and urine samples . They will also have imaging studies to test their brain responses , especially to food-related cues . Some participants will also have a study visit to test their insulin resistance levels . Participants will have four separate study visits 6 weeks apart . They will keep a food diary before each visit . At each visit , they will have one of the following combinations of drugs : Double placebo Placebo and nabilone Placebo and low dose of CP-945,598 Placebo and high dose of CP-945,598 . Participants will have follow-up visits 1 week after each study visit . Blood samples will be taken .","Objectives and Specific Aims : We plan to investigate whether the endocannabinoid system is involved in the regulation of insulin secretion from Beta cells and in the modulation of insulin action in peripheral tissues in humans . We hypothesize that cannabinoid receptor 1 ( CB1R ) antagonist CP-945,598 will increase insulin secretion from Beta cells and improve insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues while cannabinoid receptor ( CBR ) agonist nabilone will decrease insulin secretion from Beta cells and worsen insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues . Moreover , we will investigate the brain s control over the initial phase of insulin secretion ( cephalic insulin response ) and the effect of central cannabinoid receptors . Experimental Design and Methods : Twenty healthy men , age 21-55 , will be recruited for this study . This is a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled cross-over study . Each subject will serve as his own control and each person will have four different intervention visits spaced at least 6 weeks apart . During each visit , they will receive one of the following medications in random order : placebo , nabilone 2 mg , CP-945,598 15 mg , or CP-945,598 45 mg. A sequential hyperglycemic-euglycemic clamp procedure and a 3-hr oral glucose tolerance test will be used to study the effect of CP-945,598 and nabilone on insulin secretion and insulin action in healthy men . To identify brain areas involved in cephalic insulin response , a functional MRI will be used to assess brain activation in response to food images in association with frequent blood sampling . Medical Relevance and Expected Outcome : Based on our pre-clinical animal data , CB1R antagonist enhances insulin secretion and action in response to glucose while CBR agonist virtually shuts off insulin secretion and worsens insulin action in response to glucose . The application of novel , pre-clinical findings to an understanding of human biology and pathobiology is of fundamental and critical importance . This study will give us a better understanding of the regulators of insulin secretion from Beta cells and insulin sensitivity in humans , and this new understanding is of importance to finding new treatments for type 2 diabetes .",2012-01-24,"August 4, 2023","INCLUSION CRITERIA : Healthy men only ( We want to study men because the magnitude of acute insulin response for men and women is different .

The safety of this treatment will also be studied . This will be tested in patients with leukemia , MDS , lymphoma , Hodgkin disease , and multiple myeloma . These results are measured as helping to control the disease without severe graft-versus-host disease ( GvHD ) . GvHD is when transplanted donor tissue attacks the tissues of the recipient 's body . Fludarabine , melphalan , and alemtuzumab are commonly given before stem cell transplants : Fludarabine is designed to interfere with the DNA ( genetic material ) of cancer cells , which may cause the cancer cells to die . Melphalan is designed to bind to the DNA of cells , which may cause cancer cells to die . Alemtuzumab is designed to weaken the immune system and reduce the risk of rejection of the transplant and graft-vs-host disease ( GvHD ) . The donor infusion of T-cells is designed to help restore the immune system after the transplant , cause an immune reaction against the cancer , and reduce the risk of the cancer coming back .","Study Groups : If you agree to take part in this study , you will be randomly assigned ( as in the flip of a coin ) to 1 of 2 study groups involving the dose of T-cells in the donor lymphocyte infusion . Group 1 will receive a low dose of donor T-cells . Group 2 will receive a higher dose of donor T-cells than Group 1 . Both you and your study doctor will know which group you are in . Both groups will have a stem cell transplant . The stem cells will be given by vein . The cells will travel to your bone marrow where they are designed to make healthy , new blood cells after several weeks . Study Drug Administration : Patients receive fludarabine , melphalan and alemtuzumab to kill malignant cells and suppress immunity to prevent rejection of the stem cell transplant . The day you receive the stem cells is called Day 0 . The days before you receive your stem cells are called minus days . The days after you receive the stem cells are called plus days . On Day -7 , you will be admitted to the hospital and given fluids by vein to hydrate you . On Days -6 through -3 , you will receive fludarabine by vein over 1 hour each day . On Day -2 , you will receive melphalan by vein over 30 minutes . On Day -1 , you will receive alemtuzumab by vein over 2 hours . On Day 0 , you will receive the stem cell transplant as a cell infusion by vein . After the transplant , you will receive tacrolimus and methotrexate . At first , you will receive tacrolimus as a continuous ( nonstop ) infusion until you are able to take it by mouth . You will then take tacrolimus by mouth 2 times a day for about 5 weeks and then your doctor will tell you how to taper it off ( gradually stop taking it ) . On Days 1 , 3 , and 6 after the transplant , you will receive methotrexate by vein over 30 minutes . You will receive filgrastim as an injection under the skin 1 time a day , starting 1 week after the transplant , until your blood cell levels return to normal . Filgrastim is designed to help with the growth of white blood cells . Between Day +56 and +64 , if you are in stable medical condition and have not developed GvHD , you will receive a donor lymphocyte infusion containing T-cells by vein over 10-30 minutes . You will receive Benadryl ( diphenhydramine ) by vein over 15 minutes before the infusion to lower the risk of an allergic reaction . Study Visits : Before the T-cell infusion : You will have a physical exam , including measurement of your vital signs ( blood pressure , heart rate , temperature , and breathing rate ) . You will be asked about how you are feeling and about any side effects you may be having . Blood ( about 2 teaspoons ) will be drawn to see how well the transplant has `` taken '' . You will have a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy to check the status of the disease , if your doctor thinks it is needed . To collect a bone marrow aspiration/biopsy , an area of the hip or other site is numbed with anesthetic , and a small amount of bone marrow and bone is withdrawn through a large needle . After the T-cell infusion , you will have a physical exam every week for at least 6 weeks . About 3 , 6 , and 12 months after the transplant : You will have a physical exam , including measurement of your vital signs . You will be asked about how you are feeling and about any side effects you may be having .

Mayo Clinic,NCT01514357,Nesiritide in Resistant Hypertension,John C Burnett,1,0,Hypertension,Drug,Nesiritide (BNP),Treatment,Quadruple,"Hypothesis : If the use of B-type natriuretic peptide ( BNP ) is proven to be effective in controlling high blood pressure , it may lead to a reduction of standard therapy and improved cardiovascular and kidney protection .","Hypertension remains a global burden in cardiovascular disease leading to stroke , myocardial infarction , and heart failure . Its myocardial complications result from increased mechanical load on the heart . Under physiological conditions of increased myocardial load and resulting myocardial stretch , atrial natriuretic peptide ( ANP ) and B-type natriuretic peptide ( BNP ) synthesis and secretion occur contributing to maintenance of optimal cardiorenal and blood pressure homeostasis . However , studies indicate that in subjects with cardiovascular diseases the biological structure of these hormones may be altered , thus reducing their favorable protective activities . New studies indicate that early and moderate hypertension is associated with a derangement of the natriuretic peptide system which is characterized by the lack of activation of biologically active ANP and BNP , while severe hypertension is characterized by cardiac release of altered molecular forms of ANP and BNP that have reduced biological properties and/or enhanced degradation . The broad objective of proposal is to advance the biology and therapeutics of the natriuretic peptides ( NPs ) with a special focus on the cardiac peptide BNP in human hypertension . The investigators ' proposal is based upon the biological properties of BNP ( i.e. , natriuretic , renin-angiotensin-aldosterone suppressing , vasodilating , anti-fibrotic , anti-hypertrophic and positive lusitropic ) , its mechanistic role in human hypertension , and thus its potential as an innovative chronic protein therapeutic to enhance the treatment of patients with uncontrolled and or resistant hypertension .

"The University of Texas Health Science Center, Houston",NCT01797575,N-Acetyl Cysteine and Aspirin as an Adjunctive Treatment for Bipolar Disorder,"The University of Texas Health Science Center, Houston",2,1,Bipolar Disorder,Drug,Aspirin,Treatment,Double,"We propose to conduct a double-blind placebo-controlled trial with a widely available and prototypical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent , aspirin , and an antioxidant agent , NAC , involving symptomatic Bipolar Disorder type I and II patients having a depressive or mixed episode currently . This will be the first controlled study to test the hypothesis that aspirin and NAC , by themselves or in combination , will be beneficial in treating depression in bipolar disorder patients and in promoting mood stabilization . Our study has the following Aims : Aim I - Examine efficacy of aspirin in treating depression in bipolar patients in a double-blind placebo-controlled add-on design ; Aim II - Examine efficacy of NAC in treating depression in bipolar patients in a double-blind placebo-controlled add-on design ; Aim III - Examine efficacy of combined treatment with aspirin and NAC looking for synergistic , potentiating effects ; Aim IV - Examine the role of markers of neuroinflammation , as possible mediators or modulators in therapeutic response in the treatment of depression in patients with Bipolar Disorder .","study design : BD type I or II patients ( n=160 ) , on a depressive or mixed episode , who were on therapeutic doses of any of the commonly utilized mood stabilizing agents ( lithium , anticonvulsants , atypical antipsychotics ) for at least one month and who were still symptomatic ( MADRAS > 20 ) will be enrolled . Patients will be randomly assigned to orally receive one of 4 conditions : aspirin 1000 mg ( 2 capsules of 500 mg ) qam , NAC 1000 mg ( 2 capsules of 500 mg ) bid , combined aspirin and NAC at same doses as given individually or matched placebo , as an add-on medication to their ongoing treatment regimen , for an 16-week double-blind trial . After the first 8 week of the double blind treatment , the responders will keep taking the same study drug , whichever it is . And the non-responders will be re-randomized for one of the other three groups of study drugs they have n't tried yet . Procedures to be used : The study will be carried out at the outpatient clinics affiliated with the UT Health Science Center at Houston . After signing informed consent , patients will be submitted initially to a structure psychiatric diagnostic interview ( SCID-I ) to confirm the psychiatric diagnosis , followed by a physical examination and routine labs ( CBC , liver function tests , electrolytes , kidney functions tests , thyroid function tests , urinalyses ) to rule out relevant medical problems . Physically healthy BD patients on psychotropic medications or combinations will be enrolled and randomly assigned to receive , orally , aspirin 1000 mg qam , NAC 1000 mg bid , combination of aspirin 1000 mg qam and NAC 1000 mg bid , or placebo . The study drugs doses will remain the same for the duration of the study . If patients qualify for the study initially based on SCID-I interview , physical examination , and routine labs ( CBC , liver functions tests , electrolytes , kidney function tests , thyroid function tests , and urinalyses ) , but are not currently taking an approved psychotropic medication or combinations they are eligible to participate in a lead-in phase . This phase would be starting at their screening visit and last approximately 6 to 8 weeks depending on the patient 's mood . During this lead-in phase , either the PI or Co-PI will evaluate the patient and prescribe either Lithium or Depakote . The patient will be monitored during this treatment phase by the PI or Co-PI and will return after two weeks for an evaluation . The evaluation will include the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale ( CSSR-S ) to assess risk of suicide , the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRAS ) to assess the severity of depression and the UKU side effects rating scale . If the patient is prescribed lithium , their lithium levels will be tested . The patient will continue to follow up every two weeks . At the 4 week visit , the patient will also come in for evaluation ( CSSR-S MADRAS and UKU side effects rating scale ) . At the 6 week visit , the patient will be re-evaluated for the double-blind study trial . If the patient has been on an adequate dose of the psychotropic medication for at least 4 weeks and score greater than 20 on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) , then they will be enrolled . If they do not meet inclusion criteria at the week 6 lead-in phase visit , they will return at Week 8 and be re-evaluated . PI and Co-PI will continue to prescribe the psychotropic medication throughout the lead-in phase ( up to 8 weeks ) and through the trial ( up to 16 weeks ) . During the lead-in phase participants will not be compensated . They will receive a voucher for their parking for each visit . They will be responsible for filling and paying for all prescriptions in both the lead-in phase and through the trial ( up to 16 weeks ) . Upon completion of the first 8-week double-blind trial , patients who responded to the active medication will continued on the same study drug for an additional 8 week double-blind treatment . The non-responders to one of the study drugs will be re-randomized for one of the other three groups of study not received and will remain in treatment for an additional 8 week double-blind treatment . Treatment response will be defined as improvement in the MADRS scores of at least 50 % . During the first 8-week trial , patients will be seen at weeks 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 and 8 for clinical assessment and mood ratings . During the continuation trial , they will be seen at weeks 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 and 16 . Routine labs ( CBC , liver function tests , electrolytes , kidney functions tests , thyroid function tests , urinalyses ) will be repeated at week 8 and week 16 . The main outcome measure for the study will be the scores on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale , MADRAS , which assess the severity of depressive symptoms . All patients will also be assessed with the Young Mania Rating Scale , YMRS , which assess the severity of manic symptoms . the Clinical Global Impression-Bipolar version , severity of illness , CGI-S , which is used to measure the severity of depressive , mania and severity overall . And , the UKU side-effects scale , which will assess all the side effects related or not to the study group treatments . In all visits , patients will be seen by the study psychiatrist and the research staff will complete mood ratings with the MADRAS , YMRS , CGI-BD , and the UKU side-effects scale . At baseline ( before randomization ) , week 8 and week 16 blood will be sampled for proinflammatory markers ( C-reactive protein , soluble interleukin ( IL ) -2 receptor , IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) -alpha ) , and oxidative stress markers ( superoxide dismutase activity and catalase activity , serum thiobarbituric acid reactive substances ( TBARS ) , which have been reported to be elevated in BD patients . These blood samples will be stored for possible future research on biomarkers or future genetic studies for up to 20 years , for use in pharmacogenetic research during this 20 year timeframe . The samples will be stored at the Wet Lab , in a double locked -80 degrees freezer , at BBSB , Department of Psychiatry at University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston . ( 1941 East Road , suite # 3170 Houston-TX 77054 ) for future use studying factors of Bipolar Disorder . When ( or before ) the 20 year period ends , the blood sample will be destroyed . At the screening visit , week 8 , and week 16 we will also be testing the Lithium levels in all patients that have been prescribed and currently taking the medication for study purposes . This extra test will be conducted for the safety of the patient and more Lithium level tests can be ordered under the PI 's discretion throughout the 16 week trial . Risks and potential benefits : Aspirin is a safe medication for administration to humans and is approved by the FDA as an anti-inflammatory and analgesic agent . The dose proposed for this study is within the safety range as per medication package . Its side-effect profile is overall very favorable and it has met widespread use worldwide over the past decades . The main safety issues relate to the possibility of gastrointestinal complications , which are rare ( and will be closely monitored in the weekly or biweekly visits that the study requires ) , and the propensity to interfere with coagulation and cause consequent bleeding ( which will be prevented by excluding any individuals on use of anticoagulants or with active bleeding problems ) . There were a few case reports and small case series with other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents suggesting worsening of depressive symptoms related to treatment ( e.g. , indomethacin , ibuprofen , naproxen ) , but those were uncontrolled reports with individuals who suffered from other medical illnesses ( rheumatologic diseases ) . For our proposed trial , because some patients may be on lithium at the time they start on aspirin , we will exclude individuals with pre-existing cardiac and kidney disease . For patients on lithium , we will carefully monitor their serum lithium levels every two weeks during the course of the trial . Therefore , at the doses that are being proposed we do not anticipate any significant problems related to safety of the proposed intervention . NAC is a safe compound that is commonly available and utilized over-the-counter . In a recent study the tolerability was excellent and main side effects included changes in energy level , headaches , heartburn and joint pain Blood Draws : When the blood is drawn , there may be some minimal discomfort and/or bruising . Infection , excess bleeding , clotting , or fainting is also possible , although unlikely . All usual precautions will be taken to prevent these possibilities and these risks will be minimized by using trained staff to perform the blood draws Subjects will be carefully monitored . If a subject 's condition worsen to the point that he/she might become suicidal or severely depressed , we will terminate the subject 's participation in the study and referred to his/her psychiatrist for psychiatric treatment . Breach of Confidentiality : Every effort will be made to protect the subject identity and information during the study . All lab work and scan reports will be de-identified and the medical records will be protected . However , there is a small chance that the subject information may be viewed by someone that is not involved in the research study . The study drug must be taken only by the person for whom it has been prescribed , and it must be kept out of the reach of children or persons of limited capacity to read or understand . By sharing your sample with the study doctor , there is a risk of the possible loss of the subject privacy . Although no identifiable ( name , address , etc . ) information will be shared with others outside of this research project . The clinical information obtained from subjects will be part of their medical records and maintained at UT Center of Excellence on Mood Disorders , in the Department of Psychiatry at UTHSC-H , in facilities with adequate safeguards for the protection of confidentiality . The research data will be collected and recorded using only arbitrary code numbers for identification , in order to safeguard the confidentiality . All data will be kept in a secure area . Only the members of the UT Center of Excellence on Mood Disorders research group , who will get approval from CPHS , will have access to the data files , or to the master list for the codes . For publications purposes , the patients will be designated only by their assigned codes . These blood samples , for use in pharmacogenetic research during this 15 year timeframe , samples will be stored at the Wet Lab , in a double locked -80 degrees freezer , at BBSB , Department of Psychiatry at University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston . ( 1941 East Road , suite # 3170 Houston-TX 77054 ) The possibility exists that the subject information may be taken and used for reasons outside of this project . The United States ' Genetic Information Nondiscrimination , Act ( GINA ) of 2008 , does not allow for employers or health insurance companies to discriminate against the research subject based on his/her genetic information .

University of Miami,NCT01823250,Culturally Informed Family Based Treatment of Adolescents: A Randomized Trial,University of Miami,2,1,Substance Use Disorders,Behavioral,Family Therapy based on Structural Family Therapy,Treatment,,"This Stage II randomized trial tests Culturally Informed & Flexible Family Based Treatment for Adolescents ( CIFFTA ) developed as part of a Stage I treatment development effort and yielding promising preliminary findings . Drug use rates are highest among Hispanic middle school youth and to date no treatments have met criteria for `` Well Established '' in the treatment of substance abuse in Hispanic adolescents . Further treatment for Hispanic youth and families is complicated by the fact that these families often differ from mainstream populations in culture-related values , beliefs and behaviors that can directly impact engagement , retention , and efficacy/effectiveness of drug treatment . Our efforts to develop a more powerful treatment capable of addressing these issues began with a Stage 1 study that led to the development of a multi-component treatment that includes a flexible manual that allows treatment tailoring to the unique characteristics of individual families . CIFFTA integrates innovative culturally-based , individually-based , and family-based components to : 1 ) reduce maladaptive family processes ( e.g. , poor parenting practices , family conflict ) and increase family protective factors ( e.g. , strong parent-child attachment ) , 2 ) teach adolescents skills to effectively manage interpersonal conflicts and stressors and to increase motivation to change , 3 ) deliver psycho-educational and culturally congruent material ( e.g. , modules on immigration stressors ) to youth and parents both separately and together , and 4 ) deliver the intervention using a flexible treatment manual that allows the clinician to tailor the treatment ( e.g. , by selecting the most relevant psycho-educational modules and themes ) to the unique characteristics and needs of the Hispanic family . This Stage II randomized trial randomizes 220 Hispanic adolescents ages 14-17 who meet DSM-IV criteria for Substance Abuse to a 4-month treatment of either CIFFTA or Traditional Family Therapy . The study tests CIFFTA 's efficacy in impacting drug use , risky sexual behavior , and other severe behavior problems , and hypothesized mechanisms of change , in a larger and more rigorous Stage II trial . Assessments occur at baseline , 4 months post baseline ( end of treatment ) , 10 months post baseline and 16 months post baseline . Should this line of research continue to be successful , it has the potential to contribute to the field a highly innovative and efficacious treatment for Hispanic drug abusing adolescents , a better understanding of mechanisms of treatment efficacy , and also a framework for future flexible and tailored treatments that can be used to better address the unique needs of other special populations .","This Stage II randomized trial provides a more rigorous test for Culturally Informed & Flexible Family Based Treatment for Adolescents ( CIFFTA ) which was developed as part of a Stage I treatment development effort and yielded promising preliminary findings .

Design and Methods : The study is divided into three phases . The first phase ( months 1- 5 ) prior to the initiation of the randomized trial focused on : 1 ) clarifying manual sections and finalizing all assessment measures , 2 ) hiring and training therapists and assessors , and 3 ) setting up the web-based data collection system . The second phase ( months 6-47 ) includes the implementation of the randomized trial and the delivery of all clinical treatments . Beginning in month 6 we began to recruit 220 Hispanic adolescents ( 14-17 years of age ) who meet DSM-IV criteria for Substance Abuse or Dependency . Following screening , consent and assessment , the adolescents and their families will be randomly assigned to either the ( 1 ) Culturally Informed and Flexible Family-Based Treatment for Adolescents ( CIFFTA ) or to our Traditional Family Therapy ( TFT ) . The two conditions will be tested as a four month intervention with two sessions per week . The participation of adolescents and families in clinical services will end at approximately month 48 of the grant . The third phase ( months 48-60 ) will focus on the completion of all follow-up assessments , data cleaning and logic checks , data base locks , and the analysis , interpretation and reporting of findings . Assessments will be conducted at baseline , termination ( 4 months ) , 6 month follow-up ( 10 months post baseline ) , and 12 month follow-up ( 16 months post baseline ) . Data from urine analyses , self-reports of therapeutic alliance and data on service utilization outside of the program , will also be collected throughout the entire course of therapy and service utilization will continue during periods between follow-up assessments . Longitudinal data analysis ( growth curve modeling ) will be used to test study hypotheses . More detail on the details of the randomized trial procedures is provided below . Randomized Study Design . This is a randomized clinical trial in which 220 14-17 year old Hispanic adolescents meeting DSM-IV criteria for Substance Abuse , and their families will be assessed at baseline , randomized to one of two outpatient conditions ( CIFFTA or TFT ) in which they will receive treatment twice weekly for four months , and assessed again following termination , 6 months following termination ( T3 ) and 12 months following termination ( T4 ) . Randomization will be stratified by gender , number of comorbid psychiatric disorders , whether or not they were mandated to treatment , and whether or not they are taking medication upon entry into the program . Inclusion of Family members in the study . The target adolescents and parents/guardians are asked to participate in all assessments and in treatment . All other family members living in the household of the target adolescent will be invited to participate in the family treatment but not in assessments . Our previous projects have been very successful at identifying and engaging family members into treatment as well as in retaining them throughout the course of the treatment . In our Stage I project we were successful at engaging family members into treatment as indicated by the fact that we had an average of three family members per participant household participating in the family intervention component . Participant Recruitment Plan : We have a strong partnership with the Miami Behavioral Health Center which runs the Miami-Dade County Juvenile Addiction Receiving Facility in which all youth meet DSM-IV criteria for drug abuse and for which approximately 80 % of the youth are Hispanic . Our previous research projects received many referrals from the JARF and this is bound to increase now that it is located at our partner agency . In our currently NCMHD prevention study with 11-14 year old Hispanic youth and their parents we have been very successful at recruiting from community clinics , middle school counselors , trust counselors and directly from the community . One highly successful strategy was to conduct an interview about the research program on Spanish language television . This strategy used at the initiation of randomization produced a large wave of interested families to the project and facilitated the prompt filling of all slots . Similar interventions on Spanish radio have been equally effective . These strategies will be utilized if participation rates are low . Screening and Assessment Procedures . Study personnel are trained to identify substance abusing youth and families and to explain the research study in detail . Those interested will be asked to sign an informed consent that allows the screening of inclusion/exclusion criteria . Those individual who meet screening criteria go on to the baseline part of the assessment . Participants that do not meet criteria will receive another set of placement referrals . Participants will be randomized immediately after baseline testing and will be given the name of the therapist that will be contacting them to schedule the first therapy session . All participants will be assessed 4 months after baseline ( post-treatment - T2 ) , 10 months after baseline ( Follow-up 1 or T3 ) and 16 months after baseline ( Follow-up 2 - T4 ) . All assessments will be administered by highly trained and competent Master 's level research assistants who are bilingual in English and Spanish . Our assessors have worked on multiple projects using the same types of self-report and interview measures proposed in this study . All measures and consents will be available in both English Spanish to ensure that primarily Spanish-speaking adolescents or parents are not excluded . Each assessment interview lasts approximately 3 hours and consists of three parts : an individual interview with the adolescent , an individual interview with each parent , and a family interview session . To ensure participation at the T2-T4 assessments , families will be paid $ 40 for T2 and $ 75 for T3 and $ 100 for T4 , for completed assessments . The fees may be slightly higher than other projects that work only with individual participants because our assessments include multiple family members ( typically an adolescent and two caregivers ) . The fee is meant to compensate 3 participants X approximately 3 hours each or 9 total hours of assessment time per time-point . All assessment data are entered directly into a web-based Velos system . Therapist Supervision and Adherence Monitoring . Separate weekly clinical meetings are held for the CIFFTA and TFT condition therapists . Each therapist will receive formal supervision in these meetings , in addition to consults as needed . Recorded sessions will be reviewed , the clinical complexity of cases will be discussed , and good manual implementation will be emphasized . These meetings help to ensure that manualized interventions are delivered competently . The independent adherence rater will randomly select 20 % of the sessions from each condition at different treatment phases ( early , mid , and late ) for adherence ratings . These rating will document the adequacy with which treatment sessions follow specific manual interventions and treatment strategies . Ratings that fall below adequacy on any dimension/component will trigger increased supervision focus for that dimension and if necessary , re-training . Adherence raters will be trained using the established adherence checklists for the two study conditions which have been developed and used successfully in previous studies . The condition supervisors will be held as the gold-standard for inter-rater reliability on adherence ratings and raters will be trained to achieve an intra-class correlation coefficient of .70 or higher , and at least 80 % agreement across items . Inter-rater reliability will be checked regularly to avoid drift . Prevention of Dropouts from the study . To ensure retaining as much of the sample as possible , each participant will have contact with the same assessment specialist over the entire course of the study . Additional procedures that we have established to retain Ss in the study , and ensure follow-up assessments , include : 1 ) conducting assessments at convenient locations for the families including their homes when necessary , 2 ) paying families for their participation in assessments , 3 ) conducting additional service utilization phone interviews at points between the formal assessment points that is , at 6 , 8 , 12 , and 14 months post-baseline , 4 ) updating all contact information at regular intervals , and 5 ) obtaining the names of three contact persons who are close to family members and who may be contacted by the Assessment Specialist in the event that the family is unreachable at the assessment time-points ( this is included in the consent form ) . Treatment Conditions : Traditional Family Therapy ( TFT ) . The TFT condition is intended to control for many of the factors present in CIFFTA except for the systematic integration of individual level work and psycho-educational modules within a flexible treatment package . This is the same control intervention that was used in the Stage I study with one exception . In that Stage I study we tested the `` add on '' effect of the new treatment components and flexibility , to investigate whether such additions would lead to a significant boost in treatment effects . The dosages of the two interventions were not equal . To provide a more rigorous test of the intervention by having equivalent dosages in the two conditions , we have added to the TFT intervention used in the Stage I study , an additional hour per week . The additional weekly hour consists of drug education and risky sexual behavior/STI/HIV information delivered to the youth in a group format . This additional hour per week per client of intervention was selected after consultation with the director of one of the largest local community treatment agencies that uses this approach as a standard of care . The Traditional Family Therapy ( TFT ) condition intervention is rooted in the Structural Family Therapy work of Salvador Minuchin . TFT is designed to : 1 ) target behavior problems and substance abuse ; and 2 ) target youth who were unwilling to seek treatment on their own . The typical length of intervention for TFT is 4 months of weekly family sessions . An important assumption underlying this and other family-oriented models is that the family therapist can spend only a limited number of hours with participants , but by changing the family system ( parents , extended family , non-blood kin ) , the family context becomes a force that will positively influence the youth on an around the clock basis . Culturally Informed and Flexible Family-Based Treatment for Adolescents ( CIFFTA ) . The CIFFTA treatment model has three major components - Family Therapy , Individual Therapy , and Psycho-educational Modules - delivered over 16 weeks in a two session ( 60 minutes each ) per week format . One session will typically be a family session which may include Family Therapy or Psycho-educational modules designed for the family or parents alone . The other session is typically with the adolescent alone , which may include individual treatment or Psycho-educational modules designed for the adolescent . CIFFTA is a flexible manual because it allows for the selection of psycho-educational modules that address specific family and adolescent clinical and cultural issues that are central to that lives of that family . CIFFTA is an outpatient treatment . Home visits although infrequent , may be critically important at times when a key member has disengaged from therapy and must be re-engaged . Visits to schools , courts , and other important institutions in the adolescent 's ecology are also allowed as needed ( usually a maximum of 2-3 such visits per family ) . Individual characteristics that are targeted for modification by CIFFTA include : a ) impulsive involvement in unhealthy behaviors such as drug use , risky sexual behavior , and criminal activity , and b ) co-occurring psychiatric disorders . Individual level factors that support healthy development and are promoted by revised CIFFTA will be : 1 ) increased motivation to work toward healthy development , 2 ) life skills acquisition , 3 ) goal setting , 4 ) knowledge of short and long term drug effects and HIV risk , and 4 ) improved decision making . Family characteristics that will be targeted for modification by CIFFTA include : a ) maladaptive responses to immigration and acculturation processes and stresses , b ) parental neglect , c ) verbal or physical violence , and d ) interactions that reward/reinforce maladaptive behaviors ( i.e. , coercive processes ) . Family level factors that support healthy development and are promoted by revised CIFFTA will be improvements in : 1 ) parenting practices , 2 ) parent-adolescent attachment , 3 ) parental guidance and leadership , 4 ) stability of home environment , 5 ) directness and clarity of communication , and 6 ) positive/supportive family interactions . Individual and family level targets of change must be specifically able to address the ecological factors as well . For example , parenting practices may be improved to better monitor the adolescent 's peers ; parental leadership and guidance may focus on taking a more active role in advocacy in schools ; and adolescent skills may become important in better addressing peer pressure in the peer context . CIFFTA Thematic Psycho-Educational Modules Component The thematic modules component of CIFFTA provides parents and adolescents with focused information/educational sessions on specific areas that are relevant to the family . Content and process are both emphasized during the session , however content is more heavily emphasized in modules while process work ( e.g. , shaping better communication , deepening their understanding of each other , processing past traumas ) is more heavily emphasized in family sessions .",2012-06-11,"December 15, 2015","Inclusion Criteria : The adolescent has a substance abuse disorder , The adolescent is 14 to 17 years old , and The adolescent is living with at least one family member of an older generation born in a Spanish-speaking country such as a parent or grandparent Exclusion Criteria : History of any of the following DSM IV diagnoses : Developmental Disorders Elective Mutism Organic Mental Disorders ( except Psychoactive Substance-Induced ) Schizophrenia Delusional ( Paranoid ) Disorder Psychotic Disorder Bipolar Affective Disorder",190,0,14 Years,17 Years

University of Nottingham,NCT01557673,Effects of Bolus and Continuous Nasogastric Feeding on Small Bowel Water Content and Blood Flow,University of Nottingham,1,1,Enteral Feeding,Dietary Supplement,NG bolus feeding over 5 min,Basic Science,,"Following surgery some patients are unable to swallow . For those requiring nutritional support a tube is sometimes passed through the nose into the stomach to provide feeding . Traditionally this type of feeding is given slowly over the course of the day . However , it is thought that this mode of feeding might increase the amount of fluid entering the bowel contributing to symptoms of diarrhoea . An alternative strategy of feeding , given in larger volumes in a shorter space of time resembles normal feeding patterns and may reduce the amount of water entering the bowel . In this study we want to use a non invasive medical imaging technique called `` magnetic resonance imaging '' ( or MRI ) to look at the volume of bowel water following these two feeding strategies in 12 healthy volunteers . Each volunteer will have a tube inserted into the stomach via the nose and undergo the two feeding strategies at least 7 days apart . We will take repeated images using the MRI scanner to assess the bowel response and some samples of blood are required for analysis of blood sugar .","Background . Nutritional support is often required for undernourished patients who are unable to meet daily nutritional requirements . This is often due to lack of consciousness or problems with swallowing , Nasogastric ( NG ) feeding is often employed to provide active enteric nutritional support . The current approach for delivering this support usually involves pump-assisted continuous feeding spread throughout the course of a day . However , this practice is far from physiological and may promote excessive secretion of fluid into the small bowel , contributing to gastrointestinal symptoms frequently experienced by NG fed patients . Rarely , continuous enteral tube feeding has been associated with small bowel ischaemia or necrosis , although this observation has almost always been made in the critically ill. Bolus feeds given in larger volumes over shorter time periods replicate the pattern of normal feeding . Consequently gastric emptying using this method is slowed and may , therefore , reduce the metabolic demand on the small intestine and prevent excessive accumulation of small bowel fluid . Aims . This study aims to investigate the influence of bolus or continuous NG feeding on small bowel fluid content and superior mesenteric blood flow . Our hypothesis is that bolus NG feeding results in lower small bowel fluid secretion and a reduction in superior mesenteric artery blood flow in comparison to individuals who are bolus NG fed . Experimental protocol and methods . This is a single-centre , cross-over study involving 12 healthy volunteers . Two studies will be undertaken for each volunteer approximately 7 days apart : Tube bolus ( TB ) : feed administered via the NG tube over 5 min . Continuous tube drip feeding ( TD ) : feed pump delivered via the NG tube over 4 h. The sequence of treatment allocations will be concealed to assessors until all interventions , data collection , and statistical analysis has been completed . Subjects will be asked to arrive at 8:30 a.m. at the Sir Peter Mansfield Magnetic Resonance 1.5T , University of Nottingham , having abstained from alcohol , caffeine-containing drinks , and any medication for at least 24 h prior to the study , as well as having fasted overnight . An 80 cm 8FR Freka ( Fresenius Kabi , Runcorn , UK ) fine bore nasogastric ( NG ) tube will be inserted into the stomach via the nose as well as a cannula in the ante cubital fossa for blood sampling . The position of the NG tube will be verified by magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . Once the tube is sited , the volunteer will be asked to sit for 5 min in order to allow the tubes to settle and the body adapt to their presence . Following NG intubation subjects will undergo baseline MRI scanning and blood sampling for glucose , insulin and PYY . Feeding will commence at time 0 . Scanning and blood tests will proceed at 30 min intervals for a total of 4 h. The feed used in all studies will be 400 ml of Resource® Energy Vanilla nutrient drink ( Nestle Nutrition , Société des Produits Nestlé S.A ) , which is typical of a standard oral supplement . In the TB study arm the supplement will be administered through the NG tube via syringes over 5 min ; and in the TD study the feed will be administered using a pump at a rate of 100 ml/h for 4 h. Measurable end points/statistical power of the study . Primary endpoint : Small bowel water content ( SBWC ) . Secondary endpoints : Superior mesenteric artery blood flow , gastric content emptying time , plasma concentrations of glucose , insulin and peptide YY ( PYY ) . Previous work using mannitol and glucose indicates that mean ( SD ) SBWC at 40 minutes postprandially after ingesting 300ml glucose was 47 ( SD 15 ) and using n=10 we calculate we can detect a difference of 17 ml ( 36 % ) between interventions with 90 % power . We plan to recruit 12 to allow for dropouts .",2012-03-12,"May 3, 2013",Inclusion Criteria : Healthy Male Able to undergo safe magnetic resonance scanning Exclusion Criteria : Female Chronic medical conditions Regular medication Unable to undergo safe magentic resonance scanning Previous abdominal surgery Smoking,12,1,18 Years,65 Years

National Institutes of Health Clinical Center (CC),NCT01553188,AMG 386 and Abiraterone for Advanced Prostate Cancer,National Cancer Institute (NCI),2,1,Prostatic Neoplasms,Drug,AMG 386,Treatment,,"Background : Advanced prostate cancer is treated with surgery or drugs that lower the levels of androgens ( male hormones ) in the body . However , some cancers become resistant to this treatment . These types of cancers are known as castration-resistant prostate cancers . Interfering with the growth of blood vessels that feed tumors can slow prostate cancer growth . Trebananib ( AMG 386 ) , a new anticancer drug , targets the blood vessels that feed tumors . It has been tested for different types of cancer , but not for prostate cancer . Researchers want to see if AMG 386 can slow disease progression in men with castration-resistant prostate cancer . AMG 386 will be given with abiraterone and prednisone , two drugs that are also used to treat advanced prostate cancer . Objectives : - To test the safety and effectiveness of AMG 386 with abiraterone for castration-resistant prostate cancer . Eligibility : - Men at least 18 years of age with castration-resistant prostate cancer . Design : Participants will be screened with a physical exam , medical history , and imaging studies . Blood and urine samples will also be collected . Participants will be separated into two groups . The first group will have AMG 386 once per week for a total of four doses during a 28-day cycle . They will also take abiraterone once a day and prednisone twice a day , every day of the cycle . The second group will not have AMG 386 . They will take abiraterone once a day and prednisone twice a day , every day of the 28-day cycle . Treatment will be monitored with frequent blood tests and imaging studies . Participants will continue to take the study drugs as long as the disease does not progress and there are no severe side effects .","Background : Inhibition of angiogenesis , either as a stand-alone approach or in combination with chemotherapy , has demonstrable antitumor efficacy against castration-resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) and there are several antiangiogenic agents that are now in clinical trials in this population of patients . AMG 386 is a novel peptide-Fc fusion protein . The molecule is a non-glycosylated homodimer engineered by fusing an Immunoglobulin gamma-1 heavy chain constant region , partial ( IgG1 Fc ) domain to 4 copies of an anti-angiopoietin 2 ( Ang2 ) peptide . AMG 386 sequesters Ang1 and Ang2 , thereby preventing their interaction with Tie2 and inhibiting tumor endothelial cell ( EC ) proliferation and tumor growth . Abiraterone acetate is a small molecule that irreversibly inhibits Cytochrome P450 17A1 ( CYP17 ) , a rate-limiting enzyme in androgen biosynthesis , to block residual androgen synthesis in the adrenal gland and tumor cells . Previous studies have demonstrated that in vivo alterations of testosterone levels regulate the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , fibroblast growth factor ( FGF ) , and angiopoietin family members . Dual targeting of the androgen and angiogenic axis represents a novel approach as a potential targeted therapy for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) . Objectives : -To estimate the treatment effect as measured by progression free survival ( PFS ) in patients treated with AMG 386 plus abiraterone/prednisone relative to abiraterone/prednisone alone . Eligibility : -Patients with progressive , metastatic CRPC with radiographic evidence of progression after primary therapy ( surgery or radiotherapy ) and adequate androgen deprivation therapy . Design : This is an open-label , randomized , phase II multicenter trial with a two-part design and a planned accrual of 88 patients . An initial run-in phase of AMG 386 will be conducted with 15mg/kg weekly escalating to 30mg/kg weekly to establish the MTD . The decision on declaration of a safe and tolerable dose during this run-in phase will lead to the second part of the study consisting of a randomized comparison of abiraterone/prednisone plus AMG 386 ( at the established maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) ) vs. abiraterone/prednisone alone . AMG 386 will be administered intravenously every week , on days 1 , 8 , 15 and 22 of each 28-day cycle . Abiraterone acetate will be self-administered once daily by mouth and prednisone will be self-administered by mouth either twice per day at 5 mg per dose or once per day at 10 mg per dose as the patient prefers .",2012-03-10,"February 11, 2019","INCLUSION CRITERIA : Must have metastatic , progressive , castrate-resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) with radiographic evidence of disease that has continued to progress radiographically or biochemically ( rising prostatic specific antigen ( PSA ) levels on successive measurements ) despite adequate androgen-deprivation therapy .

Providence Health & Services,NCT01556347,Multi-Drug Desensitization Protocol for Heart Transplant Candidates,Providence Health & Services,2,0,Heart Transplantation,Drug,"Bortezomib, Thymoglobulin, Rituximab, Gamimune N, (IVIG), Plasmapheresis",Treatment,,"Background : Patients may develop antibodies ( human leukocyte antigen [ HLA ] alloantibodies ) to other human tissues via pregnancy , transfusions or previous transplantation , which limits the ability to find an acceptable donor heart for transplantation . Such patients are at high risk for antibody mediated rejection , graft failure , and acute rejection ( i.e . death ) . For successful transplantation , patients must receive organs from donors who lack the HLA antigens that correspond to their alloantibody specificities . No successful desensitization strategy currently exists . Purpose : To determine if desensitization by deletion of immunologic memory with a multi-drug approach including anti-T and B cell therapies and anti-plasma cell therapy can effectively eliminate or significantly reduce alloantibody levels and permit highly sensitized patients to obtain a heart transplant . This therapy is anticipated to remove immunologic memory and will require re-immunization .","Transplant candidates with HLA alloantibodies are at high risk for antibody mediated rejection ( AMR ) , graft failure , and acute rejection ( 1,2 ) . In heart transplantation , these complications lead to death . The 50 % calculated panel reactive antibody , CPRA , threshold is chosen from a consensus statement from the International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation ( 3 ) . This value is admittedly arbitrary but does represent a consensus of accepted opinion amongst experienced and reputable heart transplant centers . The alloantibodies that prevent these patients from being transplanted are a result of the adaptive immune system and immunologic memory . Immunologic memory is defined as the ability of the immune system to provide a faster , stronger and more specific response to a second exposure of an antigen , when the antigen was completely eliminated from the organism after the prior exposure . There are three major cell lines involved in immunologic memory : memory T cells , memory B cells and plasma cells , all of which can survive once antigen has been eliminated ( 4 ) . B cells can mount responses to both small soluble antigens and large antigens ( 5 ) . Once a B cell becomes activated , it can become a short lived plasma cell and produce immunoglobulin M , ( IgM ) , antibodies or it can enter a germinal center where it can undergo somatic hypermutation with affinity maturation and isotype switching . The B cell can then differentiate into a long lived plasma cell and compete for a bone marrow niche or can become a memory B cell ( 4-8 ) . Memory T cells can last a lifetime and can recirculate between the secondary lymphoid organs ( SLO ) as central memory T cells ( TCM ) or in the peripheral tissues as effector memory T cells ( TEM ) ( 4,9 ) . Upon encountering their cognate antigen , they can rapidly proliferate and differentiate to effector T cells . Memory B cells slowly proliferate and recirculate in the SLOs , last there for decades and memory B cells to vaccinia ( smallpox ) have been noted to survive for more than 50 years ( 9 ) . They are commonly identified by the presence of CD27 and upon a second antigenic challenge ; the memory B cells can rapidly proliferate and then differentiate into new plasma cells ( 10 ) . This phenomenon provides a redundant system or `` array '' to replenish plasma cells that produce antibody for a given antigen . Plasma cells are highly differentiated and specific cells that can actively produce alloantibody . There are two populations of plasma cells , short-lived and long-lived ( 8 ) . Long-lived plasma cells can last for life and can appear within less than 1 week of antigenic stimulation ( 6,7 ) . In core biopsies of kidney transplant recipients , B cells , memory B cells , plasmablasts and plasma cells have all been identified during acute rejections ( 11 ) . The plasma cells are end differentiated and therefore can not proliferate . In the bone marrow , there are a finite number of survival niches ( 109 ) dependent on the number of stromal cells present to support them . Plasma cells that do n't find sanctuary in the marrow or lose sanctuary only last a few days , probably owing to the intense metabolic demands of a cell that can produce between 10,000 to 20,000 copies of antibody per second ( 12 ) . Plasma cells are currently thought as being without a negative feedback loop to suppress their antibody synthesis . Plasma cells have been demonstrated to have an FcγRIIB receptor coupled to an immunoreceptor tyrosine based inhibitory motif ( ITIM ) ( 13 ) . The FcγRIIB receptor is a low affinity receptor and can not bind monomeric immunoglobulin G , ( IgG ) . The homeostasis of immunoglobulin is thought to be mainly the responsibility of the endothelial cell ( 14 ) . Once an antibody is produced , endothelial cells can eliminate circulating antibody by lysosomal degradation or recycling the antibody through an Fc receptor neonatal , ( FcRn ) dependent mechanism back into the plasma . A successful plan to eliminate the memory of a given antigenic encounter must address the three separate systems or `` arrays . '' The elimination of immunologic memory such that deleterious antibodies could be removed and then new favorable antibodies created would be a significant advance in the fields of transplantation and autoimmunity . A review of the medications used in IND 110875 will elucidate why this protocol may be successful where all others have failed . Rabbit antithymocyte globulin , RATG , has anti-T-cell properties , and in particular , activity against memory T-cell surface antigens , thereby causing complement mediated T-cell death in peripheral blood and apoptosis in the spleen and lymph nodes ( 15 ) . RATG has antibodies to CD27 , CD38 , HLA-DR and has demonstrated anti-memory B cell properties in vitro and in vivo ( 15-17 ) . The combination of rATG and rituximab decreased CD27 positive B cells from the spleen in patients in a desensitization trial that was otherwise unsuccessful was a significant observation ( 16 ) . Rituximab , an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody , has strong activity against B-cells and depletes B cells in the circulation for 5-7 months . But as B-cells differentiate into plasma cells , the CD20 surface marker is down regulated , with concomitant loss of sensitivity to rituximab ( 18 ) . Rituximab has been used in a variety of autoimmune diseases ( 19,20 ) . Many antibodies are not affected while others are decreased for a period of time . Short lived plasma cells may be decreased since there is not a ready supply of B cells to replace them after their short three day half-life . In a study in systemic lupus erythematosis ( SLE ) using rituximab ; flow cytometry and autoantibody specificity studies revealed that antibodies to Ro52 and La44 and measles were not decreased but antibodies to dsDNA and C1q did decrease ( 19 ) . The overall amount of immunoglobulin did not change . Plasma cells are not affected by anti-CD20 , so the antibody production from long lived plasma cells continues unabated . Memory B-cells are CD 27+ and have a variable expression of CD20 . A study in desensitizing kidney transplants candidates showed that rituximab did not decrease the number of CD27+ memory B cells or plasma cells in the spleen ( 16 ) . In ( SLE ) patients treated with rituximab the cells returning after depletion were largely naïve B cells and the plasmablasts were 2.3 times higher than at baseline ( 19 ) . While memory B cells circulating in the blood were lower after rituximab therapy , the memory B cells in the spleen appear to be unaffected and can then transform in to plasmablasts which can then secrete soluble antibody . This observation explains why some antibodies will disappear , at least temporarily with rituximab while others will not . If the antibody is coming primarily from short lived plasma cells or plasmablasts , rituximab will more likely have an effect ; these antibodies are produced by cells with a short half-life and are dependent upon continuous proliferation of B cells . Antibodies produced by long-lived plasma cells are not affected by rituximab . Rituximab does not affect memory B cells in the spleen , so they can rapidly reform plasmablasts and plasma cells to reconstitute the cell lines producing certain clones of antibodies . Since memory B-cells can become antibody secreting plasma cells , it is advantageous to remove them before transplantation in the highly sensitized patient . The combination of rATG and rituximab was shown in the human to reduce memory B cells in the spleen ( 16 ) . This finding has not yet been incorporated into a desensitization protocol or into a protocol for autoimmune therapies from our review of the literature . No other therapy effectively reduces memory B cells in the human and it represents a novel aspect of IND 110875 . No agents previously used in transplantation , including rATG and rituximab , have the ability to inhibit mature plasma cells once they find refuge in the bone marrow , and therefore have little effect on reducing antibody production . However , bortezomib , a proteasome inhibitor used in treatment of multiple myeloma , does have the ability to deplete plasma cells via many mechanisms . Proteasome inhibition represents a novel treatment strategy because it provides a means for depleting plasma cells within the bone marrow ( 21,22 ) . Bortezomib is approved for use in the treatment of multiple myeloma and the sensitivity of myeloma cells to proteasome inhibitors is proportional to their immunoglobulin synthesis rates ( 22 ) . Plasma cells are known to have high immunoglobulin synthesis rates and treatment with bortezomib depleted both short and long-lived plasma cells by more than 60 % in the spleen and 95 % in the bone marrow after 48 hours of treatment in the BALB/c mouse model . Bortezomib activated the unfolded protein response ( UPR ) documented by increases in the expression of the chaperones BiP and Chop which are markers for UPR . The authors also concluded that the late inhibition of the anti-apoptotic transcription factor NF-κB also contributed to cell death . In a lupus nephritis mouse model ( NZB/W F1 mice ) treated with bortezomib , dsDNA-specific antibodies decreased to the range of non-autoimmune mice . Total serum IgG , IgG2a , IgG3 , IgM , and IgA concentrations were all strongly reduced but concentrations of IgG1 and IgG2 were not altered or only slightly altered ( 21 ) . Total IgG concentrations were not reduced by more than 50 % . The authors noted that newly formed plasma cells could return by 48 hours after bortezomib injection . These findings support the conclusion that bortezomib can kill plasma cells , and have a salutary clinical effect , but memory B cells are not depleted and plasma cells can quickly recover and produce unwanted antibody . The ability of bortezomib to kill non-malignant plasma cells represents a major finding with potential therapeutic efficacy in transplantation and autoimmune diseases , but by itself is incapable of long lasting reductions in antibody . The clinical finding of variable reductions in antibody levels with bortezomib can be explained from these findings in the basic science literature . Bortezomib has been used as a rescue strategy for the treatment of refractory antibody mediated rejection ( 23-25 ) . An in vitro study revealed that bortezomib was able to induce apoptosis in plasma cells aspirated from renal transplant recipients whereas rATG , rituximab and IVIG all failed to cause apoptosis ( 25 ) . Treatment with bortezomib at concentrations that blocked antibody production in vitro was shown to significantly decrease the 20S proteasome chymotrypsin-like peptidase activity . Two patients had bone marrow biopsies during acute humoral rejection , one week after bortezomib and one year later which revealed that the total number of plasma cell allospecificities decreased as did the total percentage of plasma cells ( 25 ) . Not all antibodies were reduced by bortezomib in these two patients and the total IgG levels were unchanged , yet this study did show that bortezomib could decrease plasma cells in the bone marrow . Bortezomib is indicated for multiple myeloma wherein the malignant plasma cells are very aggressive in producing antibody . The more productive the myeloma cell line is to making antibody , the more susceptible to proteasome inhibition ( 22 ) . The above literature in non-malignant plasma cells also reveals that they are susceptible to proteasome inhibition with bortezomib , but in a number of studies , certain immunoglobulin fractions did not decrease and the overall amounts of immunoglobulin were unchanged . Perhaps plasma cells are not as metabolically active as their malignant counterparts . There is some evidence that plasma cells may be able to decrease their immunoglobulin synthesis and this in turn would make them less susceptible to proteasomal inhibition ( 26 ) . A reexamination of immunoglobulin homeostasis reveals a potential therapy to increase sensitivity to bortezomib . Immunoglobulin homeostasis is largely felt to be the result of plasma cell production and then FcRn mediated recycling in the endothelial cells . Antibody that does not combine with FcRn in the endosome of the endothelial cell is then degraded while antibody that does combine is recycled back to the interstitial space ( 27 ) . The concept that IgG does not have a negative feedback loop to the plasma cell is supported by data in the experimental animal and humans ( 28,29 ) . However , clinicians observe patients that `` rebound '' after plasmapheresis with levels of antibody that were just as high or higher than before plasmapheresis and this led to the conclusion that there was a negative feedback loop ( 30,31 ) . The rebound phenomenon was explained away as the return of antibody from the periphery and increased recycling by FcRn receptors ( 28 ) . The regulation of protein synthesis in the plasma cell has received new attention and is controlled by a complex system of feedback loops involving the endoplasmic reticulum stress and mTOR signaling ( 32 ) . Recent investigations into the mechanism of intravenous immunoglobulin , IVIG , function offer further insight into possible explanation for a negative feedback loop to plasma cells . IVIG in the clinical literature is thought to work by a number of pathways including anti-idiotypic antibodies , inhibition of cytokine gene activation , anti-T cell receptor activity , anti CD4 activity , stimulation of cytokine receptor antagonists , inhibition of complement activity and Fc mediated interactions with antigen presenting cells to block T cell activation ( 33 ) . Recent work reveals that these mechanisms are possibly erroneous . Studies in children with ITP in 1993 revealed that infusion of Fc fragments provided the anti-inflammatory properties ( 34 ) . The anti-inflammatory properties of IVIG can now be attributed to Fc sialylation of IgG ( 35-37 ) . Immunoglobulins are glycoproteins and a single N-linked glycan is found at Asn297 in the Fc domain . This covalently linked complex glycan is composed of a biantennary heptapolysaccharide containing N-acetylglucosamine and mannose and two terminal sialic acid residues ( 35 ) . Further modifications of this carbohydrate structure are common and over 30 different glycans have been identified at this one site and glycosylation of IgG is mandatory for FcγR binding . The total anti-inflammatory activity of IVIG depends on the sialylation of the IgG Fc fragments and this represents only 5 % of the IgG pool . The small amount of sialylated IgG in IVIG explains why large doses are required for its anti-inflammatory effects while much lower doses are required to treat hypogammaglobulinemia . Plasmapheresis , by decreasing sialylated IgG , may lead to the up-regulation of antibody synthesis in plasma cells and make them more susceptible to bortezomib . The index patient treated with a protocol similar to this one , the patient had effective deletion ( < 5000MFI ) of all of their antibodies detected by LABScreen , including the Class II antibodies that prior to this had been difficult to remove . Using the much more stringent criteria of < 1000 MFI , the index patient had only one remaining antibody over 1000 at the end of 3 cycles of the bortezomib treatment phase . The patient was unique amongst the case reports of therapies for antibody mediated rejection and desensitization therapy in that all of the patient 's antibodies dramatically declined and the total amount of soluble antibody decreased to the point where the patient required IVIG for replacement therapy . If this result is reproducible and the protocol has sufficient safety , then these results could have important ramifications in the fields of transplantation and autoimmune disease . Autoantibody mediated diseases may now have the potential of cure if the immunologic memory of the inciting epitopes is erased . It is impossible to study these medications in the usual one-drug-at-a-time methodology given the redundant nature of immunologic memory . The potential risk of the protocol is only acceptable because of the need to develop an effective therapy for a life-threatening situation . This protocol is in line with the criteria elucidated by the FDA in the recent New England Journal of Medicine article , `` Development of Novel Combination Therapies '' ( 38 ) . The article mainly describes combination therapies for cancer trials ; however , the thematic components of the document apply to IND 110875 .",2012-03-15,"June 11, 2018","Inclusion Criteria : 1 .

Indiana University,NCT01553318,Novel Use of (Oral) Ketotifen for the Treatment of Fibromyalgia: A Pilot Study,Indiana University,3,1,Fibromyalgia,Drug,Ketotifen,Basic Science,Triple,"The purpose of this 10-week study is to determine the effects of a medication called Ketotifen on pain sensitivity ; and fibromyalgia-related pain . Ketotifen works by inhibiting ( to prevent or slow down ) certain substances in the body that are known to cause inflammation . It is an antihistamine that reduces the harmful effects of histamine . The ophthalmic ( eye drops ) formulation of ketotifen has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) and has been available in the United States for more than a decade . Oral ( taken by mouth ) ketotifen has been in available in other countries for several decades . Commonly prescribed for the maintenance treatment of asthma and allergic rhinitis , ketotifen has long track record of safety . To date , the oral form of ketotifen has not been approved by the FDA , therefore this study is referred to as an `` investigational drug study . '' Prior to opening recruitment an `` investigational new drug '' ( IND ) application which included scientific data and information regarding human safety plans was submitted to and approved by the FDA .","Approximately 46 subjects will be participating in this research . Each subject will be randomized ( like flipping a coin ) to one of two groups ; approximately 23 volunteers will be randomized to receive the active medication and 23 will receive the placebo . Both groups will be `` blinded '' ( will not know ) to which group they have been assigned . The study will be conducted at the Indiana University Clinical Research Center for Pain ( CRCP ) , located on the IUPUI campus in the National Institute of Fitness and Sport building , at 250 University Blvd. , Suite 118 Indianapolis , Indiana , 46202 . To summarize : The subject will be asked to visit the CRCP on four separate occasions : Initial Screening , Week 1 , Week 2 , and Week 10 . This study also includes , answering questionnaires , taking study medication , maintaining a written medication diary and agreeing to remain in weekly contact with the study team to answer a short side effect questionnaire .

Johns Hopkins University,NCT01551095,Self-Propelled Percutaneous Endoscopic GastroJejunostomy (PEG-J),Johns Hopkins University,2,0,GERD,Device,PEGJ tube,Supportive Care,,This research is being done to study the safety of an investigational percutaneous endoscopic gastrojejunostomy ( PEGJ ) tube and whether the addition of a balloon on the end of the J tube prevents it from slipping back into the stomach .,"The word `` investigational '' means the PEGJ feeding tube used in this study is not approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) and is still being tested in research studies . Currently commercially available PEGJ tubes are long tubes which are placed into the part of the small intestine that connects to the stomach ( duodenum ) under endoscopic guidance . The tip of these PEGJ tubes usually have some built-in extra weight ( several grams ) , which theoretically should prevent slippage of the tube back into the stomach . However , these tubes usually can not be placed very far into the duodenum and the build-in weight is usually not sufficient to keep the tube in place . The tip of the currently commercially available PEGJ tubes often ( usually within 1-2 weeks ) migrates back into the stomach and at that point the tube needs to be replaced . The investigational PEGJ feeding tube used in this study is self-propelled and has a balloon on its tip . The tip of this tube is directed endoscopically through the part of the stomach that connects to the duodenum ( pylorus ) , then the balloon is filled with 5 cc of water and the endoscope is removed . The water filled balloon then is carried by the movement of the intestinal muscles through the duodenum into the middle section of the small intestine ( jejunum ) . It is hoped that such a deep position of the tip of the self-propelled PEGJ tube and presence of the water-filled balloon on its tip will prevent migration of the tube back into the stomach and therefore eliminates the need for tube replacement . The only difference between the currently approved PEGJ feeding tube and the investigational one being used in this study is the addition of the balloon to the tip of the J port . People who come to Johns Hopkins Hospital for PEGJ placement as part of standard clinical care and who are not pregnant may join the study .",2012-02-29,"March 2, 2017","Inclusion Criteria : age 18-90 years need for post-pyloric feeding ( patients unable to eat due to stroke , intubated patients with respiratory failure , patients with acute pancreatitis , etc ) ability to give informed consent for the study Exclusion Criteria : patients with uncorrectable bleeding disorders ( INR more than 1.5 , platelet count less than 50,000 ) inability to get informed consent for the study from patients or their families pregnancy ( all women of child-bearing age will undergo urine pregnancy testing )",7,0,18 Years,90 Years
Innovaderm Research Inc.,NCT01556672,Adalimumab-psoriasis and Small Bowel Lesions,Innovaderm Research Inc.,4,1,Plaque Psoriasis,Drug,Adalimumab,Treatment,,"This study will determine the prevalence of small bowel lesions suggestive of Crohn 's disease ( CD ) in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis using capsule endoscopy . The study also aims to determine if the treatment of psoriasis with adalimumab will have an effect on the healing of the small bowel for patients who have lesions suggestive of CD . Patients with psoriasis are at increased risk of developing Crohn 's disease ( CD ) , but the exact prevalence of CD in patients with psoriasis at this time is unknown as many patients probably have undiagnosed disease as the early signs will often cause no symptoms . CD is therefore receiving very little attention from dermatologists who are treating patients with psoriasis . For example , very few dermatologists will actively question patients with psoriasis about symptoms of CD . This lack of knowledge may induce delays in diagnosis . By the time the diagnosis is made and patients receive their first treatment , they may already have significant fibrosis and stenosis of the intestine . Current treatments , including adalimumab , can not reverse small bowel anomalies to normal in the presence of fibrosis . Therefore , many patients with a late diagnosis will still have symptoms or will eventually require surgery despite good control of the inflammation . Treatment of CD should start as early as possible , as early treatment has been associated with an increased rate of complete healing . Complete control of the disease at its early stages may prevent complications .","This open-label , phase IV , 24-week study will recruit a total of 100 patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis without a diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease .

Because they make growth factors , these cells can help re-grow tissue and encourage repair of damaged tissue . Tests on damaged heart muscle suggest that injecting these cells directly into damaged heart muscle can improve heart function . Researchers want to give stem cells to people who are having open heart surgery to see if they can help to repair heart muscle damage . Objectives : - To test the safety and effectiveness of bone marrow stromal stem cell injections given during heart surgery to treat heart muscle damage . Eligibility : - Individuals at least 18 years of age who are scheduled to have open heart surgery for heart artery or vein blockages . Design : Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history . Blood and urine samples will also be collected . Participants will have bone marrow taken from both hip bones about 3 weeks before the heart surgery . During the surgery , the stromal stem cells collected from the bone marrow will be given into the damaged portion of the heart muscle . The rest of the heart surgery will be performed according to standard procedures . After the surgery , participants will be monitored for complications from the stromal stem cells . Participants will have heart function tests to see if the stromal stem cell treatments were effective ....","Background : Many investigators now believe that bone marrow-derived stem cells or endothelial progenitor cells can be recruited to and incorporated into tissues undergoing neovascularization , including cardiac tissue . Stem cells which include hematopoietic stem cells ( HSCs ) , endothelial progenitor cells ( EPCs ) , mesenchymal stem cells / stromal stem cells ( MSCs ) , myoblasts , and undifferentiated side population cells have been used as an alternative therapeutic strategy for ischemic cardiovascular diseases that can not be treated by routine interventional approaches . In a porcine pre-clinical study we found that cells survived after intramyocardial injection and differentiated into vascular cells , smooth muscle or endothelial cells . Functional analysis of regional wall motion and ejection fraction demonstrated statistically significant improvement in function in cell treated animals after six weeks compared with baseline and sham controls . A variety of studies have been conducted in subjects with coronary artery disease using different cell types and routes of administration . This study will be the first of its kind to administer autologous BMSC via direct intramyocardial injection in a rigorous clinical trial in the U.S . Objectives : To evaluate the safety and feasibility of direct intra-myocardial injection of autologous bone marrow stromal cells ( BMSCs ) in adult subjects undergoing coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) or transmyocardial revascularization ( TMR ) . A secondary objective is to assess whether direct intra-myocardial injection of autologous bone marrow stromal cells ( BMSCs ) improves the patient s cardiac function , quality of life , and reduces cardiac events compared with historical controls at three and six months after intervention . Eligibility : Adult subjects with three-vessel coronary artery disease who plan to undergo CABG or TMR at the NIH Heart Center at Suburban Hospital and are willing to participate , who have stable angina , LV EF less than or equal to 50 % , and who have evidence of hypokinetic segments . Subjects will be excluded if they have had a recent myocardial infarction ( MI ) , bleeding disorder , infection , HIV or who are unable to wait 3 weeks for surgery while cells are being expanded prior to injection . Design : Bone marrow aspiration will be performed on subjects who suffer from ischemic heart disease with depressed left ventricular function three weeks before their admission to have CABG or TMR in the NIH Clinical Center Outpatient Clinic . Data will be presented based on the subject s treatment regimen : Group 1 CABG+Cells ( total of 10 evaluable subjects ) Group 2 TMR + Cells ( total of 10 evaluable subjects ) The autologous MSCs will be isolated from the marrow aspirate , cultured and expanded in vitro for 3 passages ( approximately 21 days ( +/- 4 days ) ) in the Clinical Center Cell Processing Laboratory ( CPS ) , located in the Department of Transfusion Medicine ( DTM ) , Clinical Center , NIH . During the surgery at Suburban Hospital , the MSCs will be injected directly into the ischemic area after CABG or TMR . Patients will be assessed for functional improvements pre , 3 , 6 , 12 and 60 months after the surgery by transthoracic echocardiography and/or by MRI at pre , 3 and 6 months after surgery .

Columbia University,NCT01558063,Ketamine in the Treatment of Depression,Columbia University,2,1,Major Depressive Disorder,Drug,Ketamine,Treatment,Triple,"Depressed patients will be offered experimental treatment with a new , potentially fast-acting antidepressant called ketamine while being scanned by magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) to measure the chemical effect of the drug . Ketamine will be given in a dose of 0.0 ( placebo ) , 0.1 , 0.2 , 0.3 , 0.4 , or 0.5 mg/kg . If a patient does not respond to ketamine after the first infusion , it may be because s/he received ketamine placebo or the dose of ketamine was too low . In that case , an optional second scan and infusion of active ketamine ( 0.5 mg/kg ) will be offered . This second scan will occur no later than weeks after the first scan/infusion ( as scheduling permits ) . There is no guarantee that the patient will respond to the second ketamine infusion . Patients enrolled in the study are eligible for up to 6 months treatment with their study psychiatrist after the ketamine infusion ( s ) . Healthy Volunteers : Healthy controls will receive an infusion of ketamine at a single dose ( 0.5 mg/kg ) . Volunteers will only receive one MRI scan and infusion .","Major depressive disorder ( MDD ) is a common illness , affecting over 14 million American adults each year . MDD is a leading cause of disability worldwide , and is responsible for huge workplace and healthcare costs . The several week delay between onset of treatment and improvement in MDD symptoms with currently available treatments further increases the burden of the disorder . Shortening this delay is a major unmet challenge in the treatment of MDD . Studies report that a single intravenous low dose of a drug called ketamine can bring about substantial improvement in depression in hours , even in patients that have not improved with other antidepressant treatments . Certain aspects of ketamine 's drug action are fairly well understood , but the question remains of how these properties relate to antidepressant effect . The investigator 's preliminary data support the rapid antidepressant benefit from ketamine . The investigators have used a scanner to measure the effects of ketamine on two major brain chemical transmitters and found that it causes a significant increase ( more than 60 % ) in glutamate ( Glu ) and gamma aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) levels in the front of the brain . The investigators hypothesize that this increase in Glu and GABA levels , is responsible for the antidepressant action of the medication . Knowing how ketamine works could help to develop better medications that can be used orally and used for maintenance of the improvement seen with ketamine . The objective of the proposed dose finding study is to examine the relationship between the ketamine-induced improvement of MDD and the Glu and GABA responses to ketamine and to compare the Glu and GABA responses to ketamine in MDD and healthy subjects to better understand the pathophysiology of MDD . To achieve these aims this the investigators propose a randomized , placebo-controlled , double blind study with several different doses of ketamine . The investigators will conduct MRI scans to measure Glu and GABA before and during the ketamine treatment .",2012-03-16,"December 3, 2019","Patient Inclusion Criteria : Patient suffering from a major depressive episode ( MDE ) as part of an major depressive disorder ( MDD ) .

University of Washington,NCT01550302,Superficial Cervical Plexus Block for Shoulder Pain After Lung Surgery,University of Washington,4,0,Shoulder Pain,Procedure,Superficial Cervical Plexus Block,Treatment,Single,"The investigators want to know whether injecting numbing medication on the side of the neck ( also called superficial cervical plexus block ) can prevent or reduce shoulder pain that patients commonly experience after lung surgery . The investigators will perform the injection at the end of your surgery while the subjects are still under general anesthesia and before they wake up . The investigators will use a local anesthetic ( bupivacaine or Marcaine® ) that is routinely used for skin infiltration of the surgical wounds . This study is randomized and single-blind . This means that subjects will be assigned by chance ( like flipping a coin ) to receive either an injection with active medication ( bupivacaine ) , or no injection at all .","Pain management following lung surgery is of outmost importance . Providing adequate pain control facilitates patient recovery and improves lung function , therefore , leading to reduced morbidity and mortality associated with lung surgery . It is now well-established that lung surgery is associated with significant incisional pain , which in some patients may lead to development of chronic post-thoracotomy pain syndrome . In addition , many patients report significant shoulder pain that is often resistant to increasing epidural infusions and intravenous opioid therapy . The incidence of shoulder pain varies from study to study with estimates anywhere between 41 % to 97 % . Although the cause of the shoulder pain is not well understood , there are only few therapies available for the treatment of shoulder pain including acetaminophen , non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs , interscalene brachial plexus and stellate ganglion block . However , all of the currently available therapies have potentially significant side-effects . The investigators are not aware of any studies evaluating the effectiveness of superficial cervical plexus block in reducing or preventing shoulder pain following thoracotomy or thoracoscopic surgery . The superficial cervical plexus block is minimal risk procedure equivalent to an IV start . The primary aim of this study is to compare the effect of superficial cervical plexus block when added to thoracic epidural analgesia and intravenous patient controlled analgesia ( PCA ) to standard thoracic epidural analgesia and PCA used at our institution on the incidence of shoulder pain . Subjects participating in this study will receive standard clinical care in addition to the following research procedures : Intra-operative block : an injection of bupivacaine on the side of the neck at the end of the surgery while the subject is still under general anesthesia or no injection at all if in control group . If the subject is assigned to receive an injection , the investigators will be using a small needle similar to the one used to numb the skin for the IV start . There will be a single needle stick on the side of the neck ( same side as the lung surgery ) and injection of 15 mL of 0.25 % bupivacaine under the skin . Regardless of whether the subject gets an injection or not , he/she will receive standard clinical care . Post-lung surgery pain assessment : the investigators will ask the subjects to rate their pain at the incision site , chest tube site and shoulder at rest and with movement at 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 and 48 hours after lung surgery . The investigators will also ask the subjects about any side-effects that may be associated with the standard narcotic pain medications . The investigators will collect the following data from the medical record including : Presence or absence of shoulder pain The amount of pain medicines ( narcotics ) needed to treat subject 's pain over 24 and 48 hours after lung surgery The presence of any side-effects of narcotic pain medications Blood pressure , heart rate , EKG and oxygen levels when available in order to evaluate if improved shoulder pain and less narcotics used will have additional beneficial effects Subjects are eligible if they are age 18-75 years and undergoing lung surgery .

This study will look at what effects , good and/or bad , that these drugs have on solid tumors . Eribulin is a drug that has been approved by the FDA for breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body . Cyclophosphamide has been approved for different types of cancers ( including breast cancer ) . However , the combination of eribulin and cyclophosphamide is considered experimental ; that means this combination has not been approved by the FDA . The funding for this study is provided by Eisai Inc. , the maker of eribulin .","This is a phase Ib/II trial designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) and does limiting toxicities ( DLTs ) of the combination of eribulin and cyclophosphamide in solid tumors and make preliminary estimates regarding efficacy of this treatment in patients with advanced breast cancer . The study includes a standard dose-confirmation schema ( phase Ib portion ) enrolling 3 to 6 patients/subjects , with any solid tumors , per cohort ( 3+3 design ) with a total of 18 patients . The dose-expansion ( phase II portion ) will enroll 40 patients with advanced breast cancer to detect an effect size of 15 % with a power of 80 % with endpoints of safety , efficacy , and clinical benefit rate . A maximum of 58 patients will be enrolled on the phase Ib and II portions of this trial combined and will be treated until disease progression or toxicity mandate treatment change . Eribulin is a non-taxane microtubule inhibitor that is FDA approved as monotherapy for the treatment of taxane and anthracycline resistant metastatic breast cancer . The combination of docetaxel and cyclophosphamide is a well-accepted adjuvant chemotherapy regimen that has become an increasingly common therapeutic choice for intermediate risk early stage breast cancer . Eribulin has a favorable toxicity profile compared to docetaxel with the most common adverse reactions ( incidence ≤25 % ) including neutropenia , anemia , asthenia/fatigue , alopecia , peripheral neuropathy , nausea , and constipation . Eribulin appears to have activity in taxane resistant disease , making it an attractive partner with cyclophosphamide . Neuropathy can be a devastating complication from adjuvant chemotherapy and in the metastatic setting , may limit effective therapy and reduce quality of life . Understanding the host factors that predict risk for neuropathy is critical , as these patients may in particular benefit from the lower risk of neuropathy associated with eribulin therapy . In conjunction with this trial , we have included correlative studies to study the proposed pharmacogenomic factors associated with risk of neuropathy .

Kaali Institute IVF Center,NCT01694641,"Embryo Selection by Time Lapse Monitoring for Single Embryo Transfer (""SET"")",Kaali Institute IVF Center,4,0,Clinical Pregnancy After Single Embryo Transfer,Other,time-lapse morphokinetic evaluation,Diagnostic,Single,A multiple pregnancy is an undesired outcome of assisted reproduction . Current embryo selection technologies are inefficient in identifying the embryo with the highest implantation potential . Time lapse ( TL ) embryo monitoring provides additional information about embryo development and therefore may aid embryo selection . The investigators aim is to study whether TL monitoring is superior to traditional embryo observation when a single blastocyst is selected for transfer ( ET ) .,"Prospective RCT comparing two embryo selection methods ( TL algorithm vs standard morphology based ) for SET . Infertile couples scheduled to undergo IVF or intracytoplasmic sperm injection ( ICSI ) and met the inclusion-exclusion criteria were enrolled . Randomization to Groups 1 or 2 was performed prior to the start of stimulation . Randomization was carried out in blocks of two , by selecting TL or control assignments from closed , opaque envelopes . Patients were blinded to allocation . Standard luteal long ( Suprefact , Sanofi Aventis ) and flexible gonadotropin-releasing hormone ( GnRH ) antagonist ( Cetrotide , Merck Serono ) protocols and recombinant FSH ( Gonal-f , Merck Serono ) were used for stimulation . Embryos were placed into individual wells of a 9-well Primo Vision culture dish ( Vitrolife AB , Sweden ) on day 1 of culture , after checking for fertilization . Out of incubator handling was same in the groups ; : day 1 : fertilization check ; day 3 : culture medium change ; day 5 : transfer . On days 3 and 5 , the embryos were morphologically assessed under an inverted microscope . Embryos in TL group were imaged at 10-minute intervals . The Primo Vision software was used for the analysis of TL images . The first appearance of the 2 , 3 , 4 and 5 cell stages ( t2 , t3 , t4 and t5 , respectively ) were annotated . Timing of the kinetic events was calculated from the time of the fertilization ( t0 ) . ( for TL parameter definitions see supplement ) There were no adjustments of the kinetic events depending on the method of fertilization . Blastocyst morphology was assessed using the Gardner score . Fragmentation was assessed when it reached the highest grade in the sequence of the TL images . Cytoplasmic abnormalities ( vacuoles ) were also recorded . The TL reference ranges were defined and fixed before the start of the recruitment , Embryos in the control group were selected based on actual morphology . The primary end point was pregnancy rate ( PR ; rise in β human chorionic gonadotropin [ hCG ] ) per patient based on intention to treat . Further endpoints were ongoing pregnancy rate ( OPR ; pregnancy that progresses beyond 12 weeks gestation ) , pregnancy loss ( loss of pregnancy after an initial rise in βhCG up to 12 weeks gestation ) , live birth rate ( LBR ) , gestational age ( GA ) at delivery and birth weight of the offspring . When calculating sample size we assumed a 13 % increase in pregnancy rate from an expected 42 % to 55 % . We planned to run the study with 1:1 ratio between the groups and do one interim monitoring with 0.1 information fraction . Using two-sided test and Pocock boundaries for estimation , 282 patients in each group was calculated ( power of 80 % , p of 5 % ) . Assuming a 10 % dropout rate we needed to enroll 620 patients . Based on the results of the interim monitoring ( 61 cases in two arms ) the pregnancy rate in the TL group was 15 % higher than in controls ( 58.3 % vs. 44.0 % ) . Assuming 58 % pregnancy rate in the TL group and 44 % in controls , a sample size of 210 per group , was needed to achieve a power of 80 % , at a significance level of 5 % . Assuming 10 % dropout rate a total sample of size of 462 patients were needed . The groups were compared based on maximum likelihood estimation principles . We hypothesized and then showed that the patients in the treatment arms were similar at baseline , on average , with respect to variables that might influence outcome . Chi-square tests , likelihood-ratio tests and exact tests were used for the analysis of categorical variables . Continuous variables were compared using independent group t-test and . analysis of variance . Normality and homogeneity of variances were examined . At the interim analysis of the trial the primary endpoint ( pregnancy rate ) between TL and control group was compared with Fisher 's exact test . After closing the trial the primary endpoint ( pregnancy rate ) among the groups was compared with Fisher 's exact test . Bonferroni correction was used for the p-value at the end of the trial . All other p-values were considered exploratory in nature . During the analyses the extent and distribution of missing data were also examined . No imputations were made for missing data .",2012-09-21,"January 16, 2018",Inclusion Criteria : Age < 36 yrs baseline FSH < 10 IU/l regular 25-35 day cycles less than 2 previous failed IVF cycles intact uterus an indication for IVF BMI < 18- < 30 kg/m2 acceptance of single embryo transfer Exclusion Criteria : PCOS Sperm obtained by surgical extraction chromosome abnormality Presence of hydrosalpinx stage III/IV endometriosis Less than 3 good quality day 3 embryos only one good quality day 5 embryos lack of consent,161,1,18 Years,36 Years

Norwegian University of Science and Technology,NCT01695317,Effect of Acetyl-L-carnitine in Migraine,Norwegian University of Science and Technology,4,1,Migraine,Drug,Acetyl-L-carnitine,Treatment,Quadruple,"Traditionally , beta blockers have been used for migraine prophylaxis , but in later years also antiepileptic drugs . Contraindications and side effects have to some degree limited their use , and new prophylactics that can be used by most migraine sufferers and with little side effects are in demand . One product that may seem to fulfill these requirements is Acetyl-L-carnitine , which is a dietary supplement and naturally occurs in plants and animals . L-carnitine is necessary for fatty-acid metabolism and energy production . To our knowledge , no placebo-controlled studies have previously evaluated the efficacy of Acetyl-L-carnitine in adults with migraine . The aims of the present study is to evaluate the efficacy of Acetyl-L-carnitine as a prophylaxis in migraine patients","The study will be a single-centre double-blinded , randomized , placebo controlled crossover study with Acetyl-L-carnitine or placebo . We plan to include 72 patients . The follow up duration will be 36 weeks . The study will be performed according to Good Clinical Practice , and relying partly on the International Headache Society Guidelines for controlled trials of drugs in migraine from 2012 and partly on the guidelines divulged by the International Headache Society task force on trial guidelines for chronic migraine . After a screening visit including a neurological consultation , eligible patients will sign an informed consent declaration before they enter a 4 week run-in ( baseline ) period when they keep a headache diary . After 4 weeks they return for the second visit . If they have had 2 or more migraine attacks they are allowed to proceed in the study . If they have less than 2 migraine attacks ( required for proceeding in the study ) , they are allowed to extend the baseline period another 4 weeks . Those who then during the whole 8 week period have on average 2 or more migraine attacks per month are also allowed to proceed . Otherwise they are excluded from the study . Details of the treatment period The duration of each of the two treatment periods is 12 weeks . During each period there will be one telephone contact at the start of each treatment period to remind patients to start with medicines , and one after 2 weeks to check compliance and side effects . In the second last week of every treatment period there will be a doctor and nurse visit with drug accounting and dispensing of new medicines for the next period . At this visit one will ensure that the patient has just enough medicines left to finish the period before the wash-out . As recommended in crossover studies , the participants enter a washout period of 4 weeks between the two treatment periods , to reduce the risk of carryover effect . Randomization Randomization will be generated using a computerized procedure . A randomization list containing 72 patient numbers is made before the start of the study , and the patient number is then indicated on a package with medicines for that patient . The study has a crossover design , and the two different treatment periods ( active or placebo ) can arise to two different treatment sequences ( AP or PA ) . Patients are therefore randomized in blocks of 4 where one of these two treatment sequences is assigned to each patient in random order . With 72 patients to be included , this means that 18 patients are randomized in each block . In each block , 50 % patients have the treatment sequence AP , and 50 % PA in a random order .",2012-09-24,"February 15, 2022","Inclusion Criteria : Age 18 to 65 years Signed informed consent Migraine with or without aura according to International Classification of Headache Disorders , second version ( ICHD-2 ) criteria chronic migraine according to the ICHD-2 criteria ( revision 1 ) Retrospectively have 2 or more migraine attacks per month during the last 3 month During the baseline period have 2 or more migraine attacks Debut of migraine at least one year prior to inclusion Start of migraine before age 50 years Body mass index ( BMI ) between 18-35 kg/m2 No medication overuse during the last 3 months defined as headache > 14 days/month combined with overuse simple analgesics > 14 days/month or triptans or combined medications ≥ 10 days/month .

At pharmacologic concentrations however , pro-urokinase is converted to urokinase - a non specific thrombolytic , limiting its therapeutic use . Mutant pro-urokinase ( M5 ) is more stable and its conversion to urokinase is inhibited by C1-inhibitor . The primary objectives of the study are : To assess the overall safety and tolerability related to systemic plasminogen activation of single doses of M5 over a wide dose range ( study part I ) . To assess the effect of single doses of C1-inhibitor on the overall safety and tolerability of single doses of M5 and its effect on M5-induced coagulation changes ( study part II ) .","Mutant proUK , M5 , was specifically designed to improve the plasma stability of single-chain proUK by reducing its intrinsic catalytic activity and allowing it to retain its proenzyme form until it encounters a thrombus . As an additional consequence of the mutation , its two-chain enzymatic form ( tcM5 ) is sensitive to inhibition by C1-inhibitor ( C1INH ) a relatively abundant plasma inhibitor . While it has a negligible effect on urokinase ( UK ) , C1INH inhibits tcM5 irreversibly , preventing non-specific plasminogen activation , responsible for bleeding complications . The effect of endogenous C1INH can be augmented by the addition of exogenous C1INH . In vitro studies in rats and dogs indicated that adding C1INH to plasma prior to clot lysis by M5 prevented bleeding , fibrinogenolysis and plasminogen depletion but did not affect the rate of fibrinolysis . In a recent pilot rat stroke study , at similarly effective doses , M5 , preceded by C1INH adjunctive therapy , was equivalent to tPA alone but caused significantly less ICH , was much more effective than tPA preceded by adjunctive C1INH , and was the only group with a significant functional improvement at 24h . Dose restrictions which limit efficacy of tPA-based thrombolysis are expected to be circumvented by M5 preceded by adjunctive C1INH .

University of Rochester,NCT01698567,Antithrombin III in Infants With Cardiopulmonary Bypass (CPB),University of Rochester,1,0,Congenital Heart Disease,Drug,Antithrombin III,Treatment,Triple,The purpose of this study is to discern whether supplementation of Antithrombin III will decrease coagulation and inflammation associated with cardiopulmonary bypass in infants undergoing cardiac surgery .,"Cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) and cardiovascular surgery initiate diffuse activation of coagulation , inflammation and fibrinolysis that often has deleterious effects on patient outcomes , including bleeding , transfusion , myocardial dysfunction , renal failure , pulmonary dysfunction , prolonged intubation , ICU and hospital length of stay , stroke and neurocognitive dysfunction , and mortality.Pediatric patients are especially at risk for hematologic derangement related to CPB . Not only are infants and children subject to the same diffuse activations of coagulation , inflammation , and fibrinolysis as adults , but their size , immaturity , and circulatory abnormalities secondary to congenital heart disease increase the risk of loss of hematologic homeostasis . Since an infant 's blood volume is much smaller than that of the prime in the CPB pump , hemodilution alone produces impaired hemostasis related to thrombocytopenia and coagulation factor dilution The incidence of each of these complications is variable and depends on the diagnosis , operation , time on CPB and other factors . Adequate anticoagulation during cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) is essential to preserve the hemostatic system and ensure hemostasis after surgery . Heparin has long been the mainstay of anticoagulation for CPB , due to its ease of use , familiarity , and reversibility . For heparin to exert its anticoagulant effect , it must bind with an intrinsic cofactor , antithrombin III ( ATIII ) to inhibit enzymes of the intrinsic and final common coagulation pathways . It has been established that neonates have significantly decreased levels of ATIII relative to adults , and that this relative deficiency continues at least until 6 months of age . Children with congenital heart disease have further decreases in ATIII and other abnormalities of coagulation which may contribute to adverse outcomes . Given this ATIII deficiency , it is not surprising that heparin anticoagulation does not fully suppress coagulation during CPB . Neonates anticoagulated for CPB with heparin have ongoing activation of humoral and cellular coagulation with associated activation of inflammation and fibrinolysis . Improved anticoagulation may reduce activation of these cascades and improve outcomes . In addition , infants are at high risk for post cardiac surgery intervascular thrombosis . Baseline ATIII deficiency , and consumption of ATIII during bypass may contribute to a postoperative prothrombotic state esulting in this often fatal complication . ATIII supplementation may decrease this risk . ATIII is available as a lyophilized product derived from pooled human plasma . Treatment with ATIII has been shown to improve the anticoagulant effects of heparin and attenuate activation of hemostasis and inflammation during adult CPB , and to decrease the incidence of thrombosis associated with central venous cannulation in children . The incidence of central venous thrombosis in infants undergoing cardiac surgery has been reported as 5.8 - 22 % in neonates , with a resultant mortality of 20 % . The biologic half-life of antithrombin in healthy adult volunteers is 2.5 - 3.8 days . Pharmacokinetic data in neonates is not available , but biologic activity should certainly persist through the 2 highest risk periods : CPB , where activation of coagulation produces activation of inflammation , both cellular and humoral , and fibrinolysis . The early post-op period when patients typically become hypercoagulable as part of the stress response to surgery . Hypercoagulability places the patients at high risk for central line-associated thrombosis despite by heparin-containing flush solutions which are standard of care . Ensuring a near normal level of antithrombin appears to enhance the ability of the flush solutions to inhibit thrombin generation on the catheter . ATIII has been used in infants after cardiac surgery to prophylax against central venous thrombosis , for infants with necrotizing enterocolitis ( NEC ) , and as treatment for neonates with congenital ATIII deficiency . Neonates appear to respond as expected to ATIII supplementation , with clinical efficacy for central venous thrombosis but not NEC . No complications unique to infants were reported in any of these publications . It is reasonable to expect that ATIII would be even more beneficial in infants less than 6 months old .",2012-09-04,"March 21, 2016","Inclusion Criteria : Subjects will be included if they are presenting for elective cardiac surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass and are 180 days of age or less .

The results will potentially serve as the basis for a multi-centre Phase III randomized clinical trial to determine the efficacy of this treatment in preventing preterm birth .,"Preterm birth continues to provide the greatest challenge in perinatal health care in the developed world . It is a syndrome involving multiple causes and arises from a number of social , psychological , and biological determinants . It has been estimated that intrauterine infection accounts for at least 25-40 % of spontaneous preterm births , with infection being the primary cause of extreme prematurity . Because infection-mediated preterm delivery mainly occurs in younger gestational ages ( less than 28 weeks ) , these extremely premature babies not only have the risks associated with being born early , but are also likely to have severe morbidities associated with infection . Bacterial vaginosis ( BV ) is defined as a loss or significant depletion of lactobacilli coupled with an overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria and an increase in vaginal pH ( > 4.5 ) . BV is common and occurs in 20 % of the general female population , often without symptoms and is associated with a 40 % increased risk of preterm birth . The clinical finding that lactobacilli is the dominant microbe in the vagina of women with a healthy pregnancy and full term delivery , supports the association of this species with a healthy pregnancy . BV is associated with an elevation of cervico-vaginal pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-1β and IL-8 that are also associated with preterm labour ; initiating the inflammatory cascade of events involved in labour may be the mechanism by which BV triggers preterm birth . However , not all women with BV will deliver preterm suggesting that variations in genetic susceptibility may underlie the host response to the presence of BV and the risk for preterm birth . Antibiotic therapy is the current treatment for BV , but the extent to which antibiotics can prevent preterm birth in women with BV remains somewhat uncertain , with conflicting results published in the literature . The apparent ineffective nature of antibiotic therapy , perhaps due to a lack of regrowth of lactobacilli following treatment , and the possibility that the pathogens have already induced inflammatory processes that will eventually induce preterm birth , emphasizes the need to continue to investigate the role of microbes during pregnancy . Probiotics have been suggested as an alternative to antibiotic therapy in restoring vaginal lactobacilli and reversing BV . The study seeks to determine whether Lactobacillus rhamnosus , GR-1 and Lactobacillus reuteri , RC-14 when administered to pregnant women diagnosed with bacterial vaginosis or intermediate flora will reverse the condition leading to a decrease in the inflammatory mediators involved in the cascade of infection/inflammation-mediated preterm birth .",2012-09-28,"March 20, 2014","Inclusion Criteria : pregnant women prior to 17 weeks gestation singleton pregnancy over 18 years of age able to provide informed consent Exclusion Criteria : multifetal pregnancies ( twins , triplets , etc ) fetal complications ( congenital anomaly , chromosomal abnormality ) maternal history of previous preterm birth or second trimester loss significant maternal medical or surgical complications ( eg . hypertension , diabetes ) less than 18 years of age unable to provide informed consent HIV Positive Immuno-compromised",86,1,18 Years,50 Years

More than 60 % of RA or AS patients achieve good clinical response to anti-TNFα treatment . However , TNFα is also an important mediator participating in the normal immune response to infectious agents , in particular intracellular microorganisms in the human body . Therefore , opportunistic infections such as tuberculosis , viral and fungal infections have been of concern when using anti-TNFα agents . With accumulating experience , the treatment guideline for anti-TNFα therapy in latent tuberculosis is now well established . It is noteworthy that there are a number of case reports describing hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) reactivation in otherwise asymptomatic carriers who received anti-TNFα treatment . Anti-TNFα agents are now utilized as a promising treatment regimen for RA and AS treatment for even HBsAg carriers , yet there are still concerns of the risk of anti-TNFα therapy contributing to HBV reactivation . In our previous studies , we found that anti-viral therapy before starting anti-TNFα treatment may reduce the incidence of HBV reactivation , and that entecavir is likely more suitable in long-term prophylaxis for HBsAg carriers under anti-TNFα treatment . This justifies the need of a prospective trial that could demonstrate the long-term effects of prophylaxis in using anti-TNFα therapy in this subgroup of patients . It would help clinicians understand 1 ) whether anti-viral therapy is necessary in inactive HBsAg carriers initiating anti-TNFα treatment , and 2 ) at what time point would we most likely witness HBV reactivation after starting anti-TNFα therapy without anti-viral therapy coverage . In addition to established nationwide network of Rheumatologists working in major academic institutes in Korea , our division in Seoul National University Hospital has led many multi-center trials throughout the past years . In summary , the question of whether to combine anti-viral prophylaxis in HBsAg carriers starting anti-TNFα therapy is an important issue to Rheumatologists . There is no guideline for managing this subset of patients , and clinicians normally begin anti-viral therapy after the patient 's liver function worsens . Therefore , our nationwide network of specialists proposes to launch a prospective study to investigate the benefit of anti-viral prophylaxis with entecavir in HBsAg carriers starting anti-TNFα treatment .",2012-09-24,"March 2, 2017","Inclusion Criteria : Chronic hepatitis B , inactive HBsAg carriers or anti-HBc antibody positive patients with AST , ALT level equal or lower than 2x ULN Patient who has systemic rheumatic disease for which anti-TNFα treatment indication has been approved by the KFDA ; rheumatoid arthritis ( RA , 1987 ACR criteria ) , ankylosing spondylitis ( AS , modified New York criteria ) , psoriatic arthritis ( PsA , modified ESSG criteria ) , and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis ( JRA , 1977 ACR criteria ) .

Jessa Hospital,NCT01696890,Integration of Follow-up by First and Second Line Practitioners by Telemonitoring in Heart Failure.,Jessa Hospital,2,0,Chronic Heart Failure,Device,integrated follow-up,Prevention,,The aim of this study is to evaluate this model of telemonitoring-assisted close supervision and interaction between first and second line health professionals versus a model of telemonitoring without this integrated approach .,"The incidence of acute decompensated heart failure is increasing . Patients with severe heart failure are rehospitalised for decompensation several times each year , increasing the cost for health care . In these cases of recurrent decompensation , the medical intervention in hospital is often limited to increasing the dosage of diuretics or vasodilators until the patient reaches a compensated state . After discharge , a readmission can be expected within a few months . A multidisciplinary approach by primary physician , heart failure nurse , rehabilitation team and cardiologist has been shown to decrease rehospitalisation rate and increase quality of life . Very recently , our study group showed that an intense collaboration between first line practitioner and heart failure clinic , facilitated by the use of telemonitoring , can reduce mortality and hospitalisation rate . This study was a RIZIV sponsored trial of 6 months follow-up in patients with chronic heart failure . However , a large randomised multicentre trial investigating the use of telemonitoring in a population of heart failure ( NYHA II-III ) patients did not find any difference between telemonitoring and usual care ( Chaudry et al NEJM 2010 ) . In contradiction with this study , a Cochrane meta-analysis ( Ingliss 2010 ) in more than 5000 patients confirmed our finding with a reduction in mortality and morbidity . The question therefore remains which factors are responsible for success or failure of the use of telemonitoring . Based on our previous experience , the approach of close monitoring by telemonitoring , with first line intervention by the patient 's general practitioner ( GP ) and supervision by the heart failure clinic , might be the critical success factor . Therefore , the aim of this study is to evaluate this model of telemonitoring-assisted close supervision and interaction between first and second line health professionals versus a model of telemonitoring without this integrated approach .",2012-03-29,"April 6, 2015","Inclusion Criteria : patients hospitalized for decompensation of systolic heart failure LVEF < 40 % during hospitalization .

Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center Shreveport,NCT01693484,Application of Indocyanine Green Angiography for Closed Operative Calcaneus Fractures,Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center Shreveport,2,0,"Fractures, Comminuted",Drug,ICG (Indocyanine Green),Prevention,,"Researchers in the Orthopaedic surgery department at LSU Medical Center-Shreveport hope to learn if patterns of blood-flow around the incision site of patients undergoing surgery for heel-bone fractures can help predict whether complications will arise after a specific type of operation.The goals of this research study are to effectively answer as many of the following research questions as possible : Can a drug normally used to evaluate adequate blood flow in plastic surgery and tissue transfer be used to identify altered patterns of blood flow at the operative site of Calcaneus fractures , when compared to the uninjured extremity ? Are changes in blood flow identifiable at the operative site post operatively ? Are there certain patterns of blood flow present preoperatively or postoperatively that can predict wound complication ? Can certain patterns of blood flow predict the location of slough or dehiscence after surgery ? Does the incision site and its proximity to specific patterns of blood flow possibly predict wound complication ? The hypothesis is that the study drug will show a correlation between certain patterns of blood flow and whatever post-operative complications may arise .","Fractures of the calcaneus comprise 2 % of all adult fractures . These fractures make up 60 % of all tarsal injuries , the majority of which are closed , displaced intra-articular fractures . Despite the injury 's prevalence , dispute over the appropriate method of treatment remains ongoing . Several studies have shown that an open , surgical approach is superior to either a non-surgical or percutaneous approach with regard to restoring proper alignment and structure of the hindfoot , depending on the severity of the displacement , and provided that certain patient conditions do not preclude surgery . Adequately restoring hindfoot structure is paramount to good clinical outcome ; not only is proper alignment integral for fully recovering physiological functionality , but also in preventing further complications such as subtalar arthritis that present commonly in malunited calcaneal fractures . Though literature may show that open reduction and internal fixation ( ORIF ) techniques provide a better long term outcome of severely displaced intra-articular fractures , proponents of both non surgical and percutaneous approaches argue that the superiority of the outcome may be mitigated by the fact that open surgical procedures are laden post operatively with numerous wound complications . These complications include , but are not limited to , both deep and superficial infections resulting in slough , dehiscence , necrosis , and erythema in and around the surgical site . Managing infections of the surrounding soft tissue and vasculature of the calcaneus following operative treatment indeed seems to present a great challenge to treating physicians , with wound healing complications present in 2-25 % of cases . A necessity for surgical wound repair is adequately vascularized tissue , which can be difficult to come by during closure of the wound due to the undermining and displacement of soft tissue during surgery . Sufficiently perfused soft tissue can also be difficult to differentiate from tissues that are inadequately vascular based on traditional clinical criteria such as color , warmth , and dermal bleeding . The degree of this avascularity can depend on many factors relating to the patient , necessitating studies be conducted identifying what factors place a prospective patient at a higher risk for developing wound healing problems post operatively . Studies of this nature thus far have noted that factors such as age , sex , height , weight , Bohler 's angle , tobacco usage , and pre-existing conditions such as diabetes , vascular disease , and immune deficiencies may be indicative of increased likelihood for developing post surgical complications . Another risk factor of particular interest is the timing of surgery after the incidence of injury . Current literature regarding treatment of hindfoot injuries shows a moderate degree of uniformity , advocating a delay in operative measures until the soft tissue swelling around the injury has had time to subside : a window of approximately 7-14 days after injury . Additionally , in their investigation of Bohler 's angle as a predictor for wound healing complications , Shuler and colleagues noted the pre and post operative Bohler 's angle differential to be a significant predictor of developing infections , postulating that the increase in heel height during surgery may concomitantly increase soft tissue tension substantially enough to disrupt proper blood supply to the surgical site during healing . These findings lend tremendous support to the idea that blood perfusion in soft tissue plays a significant role in predicting wound healing complications . However , to our knowledge , the use of angiography to correlate pre and post operative soft tissue perfusion patterns with post operative complication in patients undergoing ORIF of fractured calcanei has never been investigated . Indocyanine green ( ICG ) angiography has been utilized in a myriad of other fields of medicine to evaluate perfusion in different tissues . It has been used in cardiac surgery to asses bypass patency , in microsurgery to assist in free tissue transfers , and in plastic surgery to assess areas of future necrosis during mastectomy operations . Recently , ICG angiography has been used in general surgery to detect ischemic tissues and aid surgeons in determining the appropriate extent of debridement necessary prior to wound closure in laparotomy procedures . Though its utility in other disciplines of medicine are currently being further developed and understood , the implications of ICG angiography in orthopaedic surgery have gone unrecognized . We postulate that soft-tissue perfusion patterns elucidated by ICG angiography in the heels of patients that have incurred calcaneal fractures may be predictive of wound healing complications that develop after surgery . This information could allow surgeons to greatly reduce the complication rate of open reduction procedures on calcaneus fractures by early utilization of appropriate , patient specific prophylactic measures , and could provide an additional contraindication to this operation for patients whom otherwise were not aware they are at an elevated risk .",2012-09-20,"May 23, 2017",Inclusion Criteria : Persons 18-65 years of age with closed unilateral operative Calcaneus fractures that may be approached by an extended lateral incision Exclusion Criteria : Patients declining participation Patients with vascular disease or injury requiring vascular repair Patients that have undergone prior ankle or hindfoot surgery Patients with additional hindfoot injury or injuries Patients with open calcaneal fracture Patients with head injury Patients with injury greater than 3 weeks old Patients who are pregnant or currently nursing Patients who are incapable of personally understanding the informed consent document due to mental incapacitation or inability to speak and understand English .,13,0,18 Years,65 Years

Johns Hopkins University,NCT01685996,Zonisamide Augmentation of Varenicline Treatment for Smoking Cessation,Johns Hopkins University,1,1,Nicotine Dependence,Drug,zonisamide,Treatment,Triple,Randomized trial to evaluate whether zonisamide can enhance varenicline-induced smoking cessation .,"About 20.6 % of the US population smokes cigarettes . This group includes nicotine dependent smokers who are resistant to current smoking cessation treatments . Varenicline is a smoking cessation medication found in meta-analytic reviews to be superior to other smoking cessation treatments , but 56 % of patients who take varenicline do not quit . One strategy to increase quit rates may be to administer a second medication to augment the efficacy of varenicline . The anti-epileptic medication zonisamide is a good candidate for adjunct treatment as it increases dopaminergic tone , normalizes glutamate homeostasis , potentiates Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid ( GABA ) release . Zonisamide improves sleep and promotes weight loss , two prominent issues not addressed by varenicline . Finally , the PI of this proposal has documented unpleasant changes in the taste of cigarettes and reductions in nicotine withdrawal among smokers receiving zonisamide as part of another clinical trial . The proposed study will explore the efficacy of varenicline + zonisamide for smoking cessation in a controlled , clinical trial . Eligible participants ( n=60 ) will be smokers ( > 10 cig/day for > 1 year ) seeking treatment .

Smoking status will be assessed via weekly urinalysis testing for cotinine ( abstinence : < 200ng/ml ) . Cotinine is a sensitive indicator of smoking status with a longer half-life then carbon monoxide ( CO ) and is more likely to detect low or intermittent smoking . The study hypothesis is that participants who receive the combination zonisamide + varenicline will achieve greater smoking abstinence compared to varenicline alone . The primary outcome measure will be the 4-week rate of biochemically-confirmed continuous smoking abstinence during weeks 7-10 . Secondary outcomes will include self-reported rates of smoking , subjective effects of cigarettes , weight change from baseline to week 10 , sleep quality , and nicotine withdrawal severity .

This is a randomized , prospective study designed to address the primary research question : Does placing a continuous femoral & tibial catheter infusion lead to superior analgesia and patient satisfaction during the entire hospital stay ? The secondary research question is : Will selectively placing a continuous tibial catheter decrease the episodes of transient foot drop to zero ? Investigators know from own regional institutional practices that by performing a continuous femoral with a single shot sciatic nerve block provides adequate analgesia of the entire leg , but by post-operative day 2 patient 's begin to experience pain with rehabilitation and rest in the posterior-lateral aspect of the knee and leg secondary to wearing off of the sciatic nerve block anesthetic . Also , it is known that by blocking the sciatic nerve proximal to its bifurcation may lead to episodes of transient foot drop due to common peroneal nerve blockage and irritation . It is hypothesized that placement of continuous catheters in the femoral and tibial nerves would provide better analgesia and lead to no episodes of foot drop as compared to the patients that receive continuous femoral and single shot sciatic blocks . Currently at Texas Tech Health Science Center-El Paso and University Medical Center , about 95 % of patient 's undergoing total knee arthroplasty 's ( TKAs ) receives a continuous femoral infusion and a single shot sciatic with an initial bolus of 30mL ( femoral ) and 20mL ( sciatic ) of Ropivicaine 0.5 % and an infusion of Ropivicaine 0.2 % at a rate of 10cc/hr ( usually started post-op ) for at least the first 48-72 hours post-operatively . For our study , Orthopedic clinic will provide a copy of the consent form to the subject so that they can review it , and if interested in participating in the study , the patient can then contact the Principal Investigator or Study Coordinator directly . After informed consent is obtained , patients will be randomized during that time using a numbering system enclosed in sealed envelopes . Group 1 will receive a pre-operative continuous femoral catheter and a post-operative single shot sciatic with both given an initial bolus of 30 mL ( femoral ) 0.5 % Ropivicaine and 20mL ( sciatic ) 0.2 % Ropivicaine . Following surgery the femoral infusion will be started , which will be running Ropivicaine 0.2 at 10cc/hr . Group 2 will receive a pre-operative continuous femoral catheter and a post-operative continuous tibial catheter with an initial bolus of 30 mL 0.5 % Ropivicaine ( femoral ) and 20mL 0.2 % Ropivicaine ( tibial ) , which will be followed by infusions post-operatively running at the same rate and dosage as group 1 . All nerve blocks performed will be placed using a nerve stimulator ( with no twitches lower than 0.2mA ) under ultrasound-guidance . Proper catheter placement will be confirmed by injecting 3mL of air and visualizing by ultrasound . Once confirmed , the bolus dose as mentioned earlier of either Ropivicaine 0.5 % ( femoral ) or 0.2 % ( sciatic/tibial ) will be injected . All TKA cases will be performed under general anesthesia with laryngeal mask airway . Considering the fact that by placing a selective continuous tibial catheter pre-operatively , we run the risk of the catheter being the surgical field during the case . For this reason , it was decided that placement after the procedure would be best . Therefore , the patient will be taken back to the block room post-operatively and a continuous tibial nerve catheter or single shot ( depending on what group assigned ) will be placed and bolused using the same technique as previously described . To detect a 30 % reduction in the pain score from 3-4 to a 1-2 would be required for an observed post-operative pain control difference . In order to achieve a statistically significant result to detect the previously observed difference , a sample of 38 patients in each group ( total of 76 ) would be required . Assuming a high consent rate and given the fact many TKA 's it is projected that this study can be completed in approximately 12 months .",2012-08-29,"April 23, 2018","Inclusion Criteria : Adult patients ( 18-85 years old ) undergoing elective total knee arthroplasty's American Society of Anesthesiology Classification ( ASA ) 1 , 2 , or 3 Exclusion Criteria : Patient refusal Under 18 Pregnancy Presence of neurological disease or existing parasthesia Diabetes Chronic drug use Infection of leg American Society of Anesthesiology Classification ( ASA ) 4-6 ( unstable conditions ) History of allergy to local anesthetics or opioids",2,0,18 Years,85 Years

If our hypothesis is proved correct , robot-assisted minimally invasive thoraco-laparoscopic esophagectomy will result in a lower percentage of postoperative complications , lower blood loss , shorter hospital stay , but with at least similar oncologic outcomes and better postoperative quality of life compared with the open transthoracic esophagectomy ( current standard ) .","Rationale : As stated in the 2010 revised Dutch esophageal carcinoma guidelines , the golden standard for surgical treatment of esophageal carcinoma is open transthoracic esophagectomy . Recent evidence suggests that robot-assisted thoraco-laparoscopic esophagectomy using the Da Vinci ® robot can provide an extensive resection , with possibly better or at least equal radical ( R0 ) resection rates and an equal number of dissected lymph nodes . This is accompanied with markedly reduced blood loss and reduction of overall complications with shorter intensive care unit ( ICU ) and hospital stay .

Mayo Clinic,NCT01547728,Response of Recombinant Antithrombin in Heparin Resistant Patients Undergoing Cardiac Surgery,Mayo Clinic,4,0,Thrombophilia Due to Acquired Antithrombin III Deficiency,Drug,Recombinant antithrombin (rhAT),Treatment,,The objective of this study is to prospectively evaluate the response of recombinant antithrombin ( rAT ) ( ATRYN ) in patients who are heparin resistant and are scheduled to undergo cardiac surgery .,"AT is an α2-globulin that is produced primarily in the liver . It binds thrombin , as well as other serine proteases , factors IX , X , XI , and XII , kallikrein , and plasmin irreversibly , which neutralizes their activity . However , only inhibition of thrombin and factor Xa by AT has physiologic and clinical significance.1 AT deficiency may occur as a congenital or acquired deficiency . Acquired deficiencies are secondary to increased AT consumption , loss of AT from the intravascular compartment ( renal failure , nephrotic syndrome ) or liver disease ( cirrhosis ) . A normal AT level is 80 % to 120 % with activity below 50 % considered clinically important based on the risk of venous thrombosis in patients with congenital deficiency of AT.2 However , the risk of thrombosis is higher in congenital forms than acquired forms of AT deficiency.3 , 4 Unfortunately , the only abnormal coagulation test associated with this condition is the assay for AT activity , which is diagnostic but not readily available . Acquired deficiencies of AT are commonly encountered in cardiac surgical patients . Anticoagulation with heparin for CPB depends on AT to inhibit clotting as heparin alone has no effect on coagulation . Heparin catalyzes AT inhibition of thrombin over a 1000 fold by binding to a lysine residue on AT and altering its conformation . Thrombin actually attacks AT , disabling it , but in the process attaches AT to thrombin , forming a complex that can be detected and used to assess thrombin formation but has no activity . Thirty percent of AT is consumed during this process so AT levels are reduced temporarily . If AT levels are not restored , then a condition may arise called heparin resistance . There are other less frequent causes of heparin resistance besides AT deficiency such as platelets , fibrin , vascular surfaces and plasma proteins.5 There is no universally accepted definition of heparin resistance . It is broadly defined as the failure of a specific heparin dose ( 300 - 400 u/kg ) to prolong an ACT beyond 400 - 480 seconds in preparation for initiation of CPB . Because the definition of heparin resistance may differ according to both heparin dose and target ACT , the incidence of heparin resistance in the literature is very variable . A recent randomized prospective study analyzing 2270 cardiac cases , identified 3.7 % of the patients to be heparin resistant but the incidence has been reported as high as 18 % - 30 % The incidence of heparin resistance is likely to further increase as the use of heparin infusions prior to cardiac surgery becomes more prevalent .",2012-02-07,"July 13, 2015","Inclusion Criteria : Patients undergoing cardiac surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) Heparin resistant according to this definition : initial activated clotting time ( ACT ) after an intravenous loading dose of heparin ( 300 u/kg ) is less than 480 seconds Exclusion criteria : current use of one or more of these medications : warfarin ( within 3 days of surgery ) ; streptokinase ; tissue plasminogen activator ; abciximab , eptifibatide , tirofiban or clopidogrel . known hypersensitivity to goat or goat milk proteins , patients with pre-existing coagulopathy defined as a history of bleeding or laboratory bleeding disorder ( e.g. , von Willebrand disease , platelet disorder ) and patients receiving direct thrombin inhibitors",42,0,18 Years,90 Years

The indication is asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . The study is an open-label , randomised , cross-over , single centre study in healthy volunteers and will be conducted in a maximum of 3 parts , A , B and C. The design is adaptive and pharmacokinetic ( PK ) data analysis follows each part to enable a decision on whether progression to the subsequent parts is required .

In each cross-over arm , subjects will be administered 7 doses ( 3.5 days bid ) with PK sampling following administration of the 7th dose . A three-day minimum wash-out period will separate each cross-over arm .","BACKGROUND : Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways characterised by varying and recurring symptoms of shortness of breath , chest tightness , wheezing and cough , airflow obstruction , bronchial hyper-responsiveness and underlying inflammation . The GINA guidelines [ Global Initiative for Asthma , ( GINA ) updated 2009 ] highlight the need to treat airway inflammation in asthma and recognise the importance of inhaled prophylactic medications such as inhaled corticosteroids and combinations of Inhaled Corticosteroids ( ICS ) / Long Acting Beta Agonists ( LABA ) such as SERETIDE™ for the treatment of chronic asthma . Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) is a preventable and treatable disease characterised by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible [ Celli , 2004 ] . The airflow limitation of COPD is primarily due to small airways disease and parenchymal destruction associated with an abnormal inflammatory response of the lungs , mainly caused by cigarette smoking [ Celli 2004 ] . COPD is characterised by symptoms of chronic and progressive breathlessness ( or dyspnea ) , cough and sputum production which can be a major cause of disability and anxiety associated with the disease . The GOLD ( Global Strategy for the Diagnosis , Management and Prevention of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ) guidelines on COPD state that the goals of pharmacologic therapy should be to control symptoms , improve health status and exercise tolerance , and reduce the frequency of COPD exacerbations [ GOLD , 2008 ] . Research has indicated that an inhaled corticosteroid ( ICS ) combined with a long acting β2-agonist ( LABA ) is more effective than the individual components in managing stable COPD to reduce exacerbations and improve lung function and health status [ Ferguson , 2008 ; Calverley , 2007 ; Kardos , 2007 ] . The efficacy of the combination product , SERETIDE has been established in the metered dose inhaler ( MDI ) and multidose powder inhaler ( Ddpi ; DISKUS™/Accuhaler ) in both asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease , COPD at a variety of dose strengths . Alternative treatment options with respect to the formulation of SERETIDE and its means of delivery via an inhaler device are currently being assessed by GSK with a view to developing a product with bioavailability characteristics comparable to those of SERETIDE delivered via the multi-dose powder inhaler ( DISKUS™/Accuhaler ) . It is intended that the product will then be progressed for treatment administration in both asthma and COPD patients . STUDY RATIONALE : A recently completed study , ASR114334 , [ GlaxoSmithKline document number YM2010/00082/02 ] evaluated the comparative bioavailability of fluticasone propionate/salmeterol delivered via the established multi-dose powder inhaler ( Ddpi , DISKUS/Accuhaler ) with the Rotahaler unit dose fluticasone propionate/salmeterol capsule-based powder inhaler ( Rdpi ) in both asthma and COPD patients . The Rotahaler ( Rdpi ) inhaler had an airflow resistance similar to the DISKUS multi-dose inhaler ( Ddpi ) . Whilst the active ingredients were a combination of fluticasone propionate/salmeterol , the devices were different with respect to their handling and instructions for operation , although both were designed to deliver at the 250/50mcg bid dose strength ie mcg equivalent doses . The results showed that plasma exposures of both fluticasone propionate ( FP ) and salmeterol were 1.5 to 2 fold higher following repeat dose administration of FP/salmeterol delivered from the Rdpi compared with those from the Ddpi , [ GlaxoSmithKline document number 2011N112456_00 ] . This was observed for both asthma and COPD patients . The purpose of this study , ASR116409 is to optimise the device and/or formulation of the FP/salmeterol unit dose powder inhaler to achieve drug delivery characteristics comparable to the FP/salmeterol DISKUS . DOSE RATIONALE : Two doses of FP/salmeterol will be administered in this study : 250/50 mcg and 100/50 mcg or lower , both doses are approved for the treatment of asthma . These doses will be administered to healthy subjects and are at or below the maximum approved doses for FP and salmeterol indicated for chronic therapy in asthma ; therefore there are no anticipated safety concerns associated with the planned short term ( 3.5 days bid ) dosing in healthy subjects . STUDY DESIGN : The study is an open-label , randomised , cross-over , single centre study in healthy volunteers in 3 parts , A , B and C. It will be conducted with an adaptive design where pharmacokinetic data analysis follows each part to enable a decision on whether progression to the subsequent parts is required . A total of 36 subjects will be enrolled in each part to ensure 32 complete . In each cross-over arm , subjects will be administered 7 doses ( 3.5 days bid ) with PK sampling following administration of the 7th dose . A three-day minimum wash-out period will separate each cross-over arm . Subjects may elect to participate in more than one part . Part A will compare the bioavailability characteristics of the following GSK devices : the Ddpi ( multi-dose dry powder inhaler , DISKUS ) , the Rdpi ( H ) ( capsule-based inhaler , high airflow resistance ) and the Rdpi ( L ) ( low airflow resistance ) . The Rdpi ( H ) has higher airflow resistance to the Ddpi compared to the Rdpi ( L ) and could allow a closer PK match . Part A will consist of a four treatment cross-over sub-study with the following arms , each arm replicated twice for each subject . Treatment arms for part A will comprise : Administration of 7 doses ( 3.5 days bid ) of FP/salmeterol ( 250/50mcg ) delivered via the Ddpi Administration of 7 doses ( 3.5 days bid ) of FP/salmeterol ( 250/50mcg ) delivered via the Rdpi ( H ) . Instructions for subjects will be to take 2 steady , deep inhalations . Administration of 7 doses ( 3.5 days bid ) of FP/salmeterol ( 250/50mcg ) delivered via the Rdpi ( L ) . Instructions for subjects will be to take 1 fast and deep inhalation Administration of 7 doses ( 3.5 days bid ) of FP/salmeterol ( 250/50mcg ) delivered via the Rdpi ( L ) . Instructions for subjects will be to take fast and deep inhalations until no powder remains in the inhaler . The Rdpi ( H ) device ( 250/50mcg FP/salmeterol ) is being assessed in Part A to bridge the data back to the previous study ( ASR114334 ) to show whether it is possible to replicate the 1.5 to 2 fold systemic exposure ratio for Rdpi ( H ) /Ddpi in healthy subjects compared to patients seen in the previous study ( ASR114334 ) . Subjects will be dosed twice daily for 3 days and once on the fourth day in the morning . The first dose on Day 1 will be administered at the site and the next four doses will be self-administered by the subjects at home . They will attend the Unit in the evening of the 3rd day where they will be administered the 6th dose and remain at the Unit for the night and following day . They will be dosed in clinic ( 7th dose ) on the morning of the fourth day and remain at site until completion of the 12 hour post-dose PK sample collection . Following a 3-day minimum wash-out period after the last dose of study medication ( Day 4 ) , subjects will participate in the subsequent arms of Part A until they have completed all 4 arms twice i.e . the 8 periods planned for completion of Part A. PK samples will be analysed and reviewed at the conclusion of Part A . If PK equivalence for FP and SALM is demonstrated between the Rdpi ( L ) and the Ddpi , and Rdpi ( H ) is demonstrated to have higher and non-equivalent PK systemic exposure compared to Ddpi , Part C will be conducted . If PK equivalence is not demonstrated , Part B will be conducted . Part B : Study design for Part B will depend on the PK results from Part A . Prior to the start of part B , a decision will be made by the sponsor team as to whether the Rdpi ( H ) or the Rdpi ( L ) device will be used ; this decision will be based on PK data from part A. FP/Salm 250/50mcg from the Ddpi will be included again in Part B as a control group . If the plasma exposures of FP and SALM obtained during Part A from Rdpi ( H ) are statistically higher than those from the Dpi and those from Rdpi ( L ) are statistically lower than those from the Ddpi , Part B will assess two intermediate airflow resistance versions of the Rdpi [ Rdpi ( IM ) ] and/or the formulation changes below : modified blend formulations reduced capsule fill weights , different capsule types If the plasma exposures of FP and SALM obtained from the Rdpi ( H ) are statistically higher than those from the Dpi and those from the Rdpi ( L ) are statistically higher than those from the Ddpi , Part B will assess the formulation changes below using Rdpi ( H ) ; modified blend formulations reduced capsule fill weights , different capsule types One variable will be assessed at a time in an open-label , randomized , cross-over manner comprising 2 to 3 arms separated by a 3-day minimum wash-out period . All comparisons will be done against the DISKUS arm , in order to test bioequivalence . The sample size and the use of replicated arms will be evaluated and defined after the completion of part A , adapting the design and the sample size to the variability observed during the previous part of the study . Following PK data analysis for all the variables , two or more variables may finally be grouped for combined assessment as an open-label investigation . Evaluation of the two intermediate high airflow resistance Rdpi devices [ Rdpi ( IM ) ] and of the formulation changes will be conducted in a cross-over design . The inhalation instructions ( number and type of breaths ) will be decided after Part A is completed . An additional arm whereby subjects will be administered the Ddpi will also be included for comparison . Part C will compare bioavailability parameters for 2 dosage strengths of FP/salmeterol : 100/50 mcg , and 250/50mcg , delivered from the Ddpi and the device/formulation shown to demonstrate bioequivalence in Part A and/or Part B . Another GSK unit dose device in development , the BUDI inhaler , will also be evaluated for its comparative bioavailability characteristics at both doses . If PK data from Part A demonstrates that the Rdpi ( L ) is PK equivalent to the Ddpi at the 250/50 mcg dose , Part B will not be conducted . We will also test the bovine capsule which may be needed for certain markets in Part C if Part B is not conducted . The various arms in Part C will not be conducted concurrently as timing of dosing for each arm will depend on availability of study medication , device and capsule type . Part C will therefore be conducted at two different points in time : Part C1 will consist of a 3 or 4-way cross-over sub-study with the following arms : Administration of 7 doses ( 3.5 days bid ) of FP/salmeterol ( 250/50mcg ) delivered via the Ddpi Administration of 7 doses ( 3.5 days bid ) of FP/salmeterol ( 100/50mcg ) delivered via the Ddpi Administration of 7 doses ( 3.5 days bid ) of FP/salmeterol ( 100/50mcg ) delivered via the device/formulation combination selected in Part A or B Administration of 7 doses ( 3.5 days bid ) of FP/salmeterol ( 250/50mcg ) delivered via the Bovine capsule ( if part B is not performed ) . Part C2 will be performed if required when the BUDI inhaler will be made available , a cross-over sub-study with the following arms : Administration of 7 doses ( 3.5 days bid ) of FP/salmeterol ( 250/50mcg ) delivered via the Ddpi Administration of 7 doses ( 3.5 days bid ) of FP/salmeterol ( 100/50mcg ) delivered via the Ddpi Administration of 7 doses ( 3.5 days bid ) of FP/salmeterol ( 250/50mcg ) delivered via BUDI Inhaler Administration of 7 doses ( 3.5 days bid ) of FP/salmeterol ( 100/50mcg ) delivered via the BUDI Inhaler . The inhalation instructions ( number and type of breaths ) will be decided after part A is completed The option to combine Parts C1 and C2 will be evaluated according to the : availability of the BUDI Inhaler and the timing of Part C PK results from the previous parts ( variability could affect the need to have replicated arms in part C as well ; further , the bovine capsule may have been already tested in part B ) . PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : To select a device and formulation combination of fluticasone propionate/salmeterol ( 250/50mcg or lower ) which has pharmacokinetic equivalence ( ratio 0.8 to 1.25 ) to fluticasone propionate/salmeterol ( 250/50mcg ) delivered via the Ddpi ( multi dose dry powder inhaler ) To compare the pharmacokinetic parameters of fluticasone propionate/salmeterol ( 250/50mcg or lower ) delivered from a range of devices and/or formulations to those of fluticasone propionate/salmeterol ( 250/50mcg ) delivered via the Ddpi in healthy volunteers . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : To determine the pharmacokinetic equivalence of the selected device/formulation combination of fluticasone propionate/salmeterol administered at a lower dose to match fluticasone propionate/salmeterol administered at the 100/50mcg dose from the Ddpi To assess the PK characteristics of the BUDI inhaler containing 100/50mcg fluticasone propionate/salmeterol and 250/50mcg fluticasone propionate/salmeterol . PRIMARY ENDPOINT : -Pharmacokinetic endpoint : Area under the plasma fluticasone propionate concentration-time curve over dosing interval ; maximum observed concentration for fluticasone propionate and salmeterol plasma concentration-time curve on the last day of each study treatment period ( Day 4 ) .

NorthShore University HealthSystem,NCT01545700,Effect of Low-Dose Dexamethasone on the Incidence of Hyperglycemia Following Surgery,NorthShore University HealthSystem,4,1,Postoperative Complications,Drug,Control-saline,Treatment,Quadruple,The question of a possible hyperglycemic effect from single-dose dexamethasone is an important issue for clinicians managing patients in the intraoperative and postoperative periods . Recent evidence suggests that even moderate elevations in blood glucose levels may be associated with adverse events . The aim of this clinical investigation is to determine whether standard clinical doses of dexamethasone produce hyperglycemia in the perioperative period .,"Patients will be randomized on the morning of surgery to one of six groups ; dexamethasone 4mg groups ( 0-4 hour group , 8-24 hour group ) , dexamethasone 8 mg groups ( 0-4 hour group , 8-24 hour group ) , or a placebo group ( 0-4 hour group , 8-24 hour group ) . Randomization will be performed using the sealed envelope method ( on the basis of a block-randomized computer-generated list ) . The drug/placebo solution will be prepared by the pharmacy into a syringe ( either 2cc of dexamethasone ( 8mg ) , 1cc dexamethasone ( 4mg ) + 1cc normal saline , or 2cc of saline ( placebo ) ) and delivered to one of investigators . All solutions are clear and appear identical . Patients in the dexamethasone groups will receive a standard intraoperative dose of dexamethasone ( either 4mg or 8 mg ) intravenously at the induction of anesthesia . Patients in the placebo groups will receive 2 cc of saline at induction of anesthesia . Study syringes will be prepared by the pharmacy , and all clinicians will be blinded to group assignment . Primary Outcome Variable Serum Glucose levels : In the 0-4 hour patients , Blood glucose concentrations will be measured at 5 time intervals : at induction of anesthesia and at 60 , 120 , 180 , and 240 minutes after the dexamethasone is administered . In the 8-24 hour patients , blood glucose levels will be measured at induction of anesthesia and at at 8- and 24-hours after induction . All blood samples will be measured using a portable glucometer which is calibrated daily . Blood glucose will be calculated by measuring a fingerprick capillary blood sample . The blood samples will be collected while the patient is under anesthesia and recovering from surgery . Secondary Outcome Variables Pain scores : Postoperative pain scores will be assessed using 100 mm visual analog scale ( VAS ) in which 0 represents no pain and 100 represents the worst pain imaginable . Pain scores will be measured at rest and with movement at 1 and 2 hours following surgery . Nausea and vomiting scores : The incidence of nausea will be quantified using a verbal rating scale ( VRS- 0=no nausea , 1=mild nausea , 2=moderate nausea , 3=severe nausea ) . The incidence of vomiting was quantified on a 4-point scale ; 0 = ( none ) no episodes , 1= ( mild ) 1 episode , 2= ( moderate ) 2-3 episodes , 3= ( severe ) more than 3 episodes .

Each system is comprised of a fully sealed traditional prosthesis which is stented at the distal end . A minimum of 10 and a maximum of 30 patients with aneurysmal disease of the ascending aorta , the arch and the proximal descending aorta will receive a hybrid prosthesis implanted without the use of the delivery system and a minimum of 10 patients and a maximum of 20 patients will be implanted with a hybrid device using the delivery system . The traditional prosthesis component is representative of current Gelweave™ product . It is a woven polyester graft , crimped to maintain the lumen and gel coated to ensure that it will seal immediately . The stented section of the graft is a self-expanding endoprosthesis constructed of a thin wall woven polyester and Nitinol ring stents , which are attached to fabric with braided polyester sutures . The delivery system is a central catheter comprised of a stainless steel braided , Isoplast-Pebax co-extrusion which has been locally strengthened to provide adequate guidewire lumen and sufficient stiffness to deploy the device . The outer sheath is 24Fr extruded PTFE with a groove to provide a localised splitting during deployment . The handle components are moulded in K-Resin & thermoplastic polyurethane to fulfil the functional requirements of the product . The compacted endoprosthesis is placed through the opened aortic arch and deployed leaving the stented section positioned inside the descending aorta . The device is then released from the delivery system and the handle components removed leaving the full graft in situ and correctly positioned . This allows the surgeon to complete the aortic arch repair as required .

Baylor College of Medicine,NCT01548651,"Effect of Saxagliptin Treatment on Myocardial Fat Content, and Monocyte Inflammation",Baylor College of Medicine,4,0,Impaired Glucose Tolerance,Drug,Saxagliptin,Treatment,Quadruple,"The purpose of the study is to examine the effect of saxagliptin , an anti-diabetes medication , on hepatic and myocardial fat content and monocyte inflammation in patients with Impaired Glucose Tolerance ( IGT ) .","Obese , insulin resistant individuals have an excess of fat in the liver which is not attributable to alcohol or other known causes of liver disease , a condition defined as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) . The fatty liver is insulin resistant . Individuals with a fatty liver are more likely to have excess intra-abdominal fat as well as a reduction in circulating plasma adiponectin levels . A new class of antidiabetes medications known as dipeptidyl peptidase 4 ( DPP-4 ) inhibitors ( sitagliptin , saxagliptin ) which enhance the circulating half life of Glucagon-like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) , an incretin hormone that enhances insulin secretion/ lowers glucose levels , have been approved to treat type 2 diabetes . More recently , it has been shown that these dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors can also decrease liver fat and inflammation in animal models of obesity by increasing circulating levels of GLP-1 . It has been shown that GLP-1 enhances liver fat oxidation , reduces liver fat synthesis , and increases adiponectin levels in animal models in vivo . Recent reports suggest that NAFLD is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease independent of associated cardiovascular risk factors . Furthermore type 2 diabetics and subjects with impaired glucose tolerance are characterized by an increase in both hepatic and myocardial fat and left ventricular ( LV ) dysfunction , particularly diastolic dysfunction . Myocardial steatosis is an independent predictor of diastolic dysfunction in type 2 diabetes mellitus as well as impaired glucose tolerance . However , the effect of saxagliptin therapy on liver and myocardial fat content , as well as LV systolic and diastolic function in patients with impaired glucose tolerance ( IGT ) or type 2 diabetes has not been previously studied . Recently , it has been demonstrated that myocardial triglyceride content is increased in type 2 diabetic patients and is associated with impaired left ventricular diastolic function , independently of age , body mass index ( BMI ) , heart rate , visceral fat , and diastolic blood pressure . More recently , it has been shown that that obese normal glucose tolerant subjects , obese subjects with IGT , and type 2 diabetic subjects have increased myocardial fat compared to lean subjects . Thus , both IGT and type 2 diabetic subjects have increased myocardial steatosis and defects in LV function . GLP-1 has been shown to improve myocardial function and cardiac output in conscious chronically instrumented canine models of cardiac injury or heart failure . GLP-1 increased cardiac output and reduced left ventricular end diastolic pressure in association with reduced systemic vascular resistance , and it improved myocardial insulin sensitivity and myocardial glucose uptake in dogs with rapid pacing-induced dilated cardiomyopathy . However , no previous study has examined the effect of saxagliptin on myocardial fat or LV function in IGT or type 2 diabetic patients . Finally , the effect of saxagliptin on vascular inflammation and monocyte Nuclear Factor-KappaB ( NFkappaB ) remains to be studied . Patients with Impaired Glucose Tolerance ( IGT ) / Impaired Fasting Glucose ( IFG ) have insulin resistance as a well established defect . Furthermore , as stated previously , both myocardial and hepatic steatosis as well as defects in LV function are well characterized in obese , insulin resistant patients with IGT . However , the effect of DPP IV inhibitors on hepatic and myocardial steatosis and monocyte inflammation in insulin resistant patients with IGT have not been previously studied .",2012-02-06,"December 24, 2019","Inclusion Criteria : Men and women with a diagnosis diagnosis of Impaired Glucose Tolerance i.e . fasting plasma glucose less than or equal to 125 mg/dl , 2 hour post 75 gram oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) plasma glucose between 140-199 mg/dl , glycosylated hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c ) less than 6.5 % as per American Diabetes Association ( ADA ) criteria .

University of Regensburg,NCT01540344,Combined Anticancer Treatment of Advanced Colon Cancer,University of Regensburg,2,0,Peritoneal Carcinomatosis,Procedure,CRS,Treatment,,The COMBATAC study evaluates the the effect as assessed by progression-free survival ( PFS ) of perioperative systemic chemotherapy including cetuximab and cytoreductive surgery ( CRS ) and bidirectional hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy ( HIPEC ) in patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis arising from colorectal cancer .,"More than 10 % of patients with colorectal cancer ( CRC ) already show peritoneal carcinomatosis at the time of initial diagnosis and up to 25 % of all patients develop peritoneal carcinomatosis during the natural course of their disease as a common sign of tumor progression or recurrence . The existing data suggests that CRS and HIPEC as an integral part of a multidisciplinary treatment concept may improve long-term survival of selected patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis of colonic origin . Moreover , hyperthermic peritoneal perfusion with oxaliplatin in combination with synchronous application of 5-FU/leucovorin seems to improve the efficacy of HIPEC in comparison to a mitomycin C-based intraperitoneal treatment regimen and may lead to a better local tumor control . The improved systemic treatment strategy with neoadjuvant chemotherapy may lead to increased rates of complete macroscopic cytoreduction and together with the adjuvant treatment to better control of distant metastasis and tumor recurrence . However , there is no prospective study available evaluating the clinical and oncological outcome after standard-of-care chemotherapy including targeted anticancer therapy in combination with CRS and HIPEC .

University of Washington,NCT01547169,Study of Nasal Insulin to Fight Forgetfulness - Long-acting Insulin Detemir - 21 Days,University of Washington,2,1,Alzheimer's Disease,Drug,Placebo Comparator,Treatment,Quadruple,"The study will examine the effects of intranasally administered long-acting insulin detemir on cognition in persons with Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) or amnestic mild cognitive impairment ( aMCI ) . The rationale for these studies is derived from growing evidence that insulin contributes to multiple brain functions , and that insulin dysregulation can contribute to AD pathogenesis . Thus , therapies aimed at restoring normal insulin signaling in the CNS may have beneficial effects on brain function . Intranasal administration of insulin increases insulin signaling in brain without raising peripheral levels and causing hypoglycemia . Insulin detemir is an insulin analogue that may have better action in brain than other insulin formulations because of its albumin binding properties . The investigators will test the therapeutic effects of intranasally-administered insulin detemir in a dose-finding study in which participants will receive one of two doses of insulin detemir or placebo for a three week period . The investigators will test the hypothesis that either dose will improve memory and daily functioning in persons with AD/aMCI compared with placebo .","It is well-known that insulin , a hormone that is naturally secreted by the pancreas , plays an important physiological role by regulating blood sugar levels in the body . The investigators now know that insulin plays many important roles in the brain as well . Insulin seems to be especially active in the part of the brain that corresponds to learning and memory . Studies have shown that when people have insufficient insulin in the brain ( which , for example , is the case with Type-II diabetes ) , they are increasingly at risk to develop memory problems and Alzheimer 's disease . In a past study , the investigators administered intravenous insulin to participants and found that it improves their memory . However , that particular method would not be a practical intervention for people with Alzheimer 's disease due to the risk of hypoglycemia or exacerbation of insulin resistance . Instead , the investigators use an `` intranasal '' method of administration , in which the insulin is inserted into a device , and administered intranasally . In this method , the insulin travels directly to the brain , and bypasses the body . Our past studies have also demonstrated that this can be a reliable way to improve memory , and it does not change the body 's blood glucose levels . In our past studies , the investigators have used regular insulin , which lasts about 3-4 hours and creates a similar `` spike '' in insulin that one would have after eating a meal . However , in normal physiology , the pancreas also releases small and more constant `` pulses '' of insulin throughout the day and night , establishing a base level of insulin . Accordingly , several longer-lasting types of insulin are now available that last closer to 10-12 hours , mimicking that base level of insulin . The current study uses a long-lasting type of insulin called `` insulin detemir , '' to determine if learning and memory will benefit from a more constant supplement of insulin . the investigators want to determine whether this treatment can benefit people who already have a memory impairment-either they already have a diagnosis of Alzheimer 's disease or are diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment , a condition that precedes Alzheimer 's disease , and whether a lower or higher dose of insulin detemir is more effective . The investigators will examine cognition , daily function , and different markers of Alzheimer 's disease that are in the blood as outcome measures . The investigators have these specific aims : The investigators will test the hypothesis that compared to placebo , three weeks of treatment with intranasal insulin detemir will improve cognition and function in adults with Alzheimer 's Disease ( AD ) or Mild Cognitive Impairment ( MCI ) . The investigators will determine which of two doses of intranasal insulin detemir produces the greatest improvement in cognition and daily function relative to placebo for adults with AD or MCI . To examine these hypotheses , the investigators are recruiting approximately 60 participants who have been diagnosed with AD or MCI . They will be randomly selected to take a lower dose of insulin detemir , a higher dose of insulin detemir , or saline ( which is an inactive substance and will serve as a placebo ) . Cognition and the level of daily function will be tested before they begin the study drug , and after 3 weeks of the study drug . The investigators will also measure glucose tolerance and take blood samples to measure markers of AD in the blood .",2012-02-07,"December 17, 2012","Inclusion Criteria : Age 50-89 Diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment , or mild/moderate AD Exclusion Criteria : Excessively high or low blood pressure , heart rate BMI greater than 34 Pre-existing diabetes not controlled by exercise Previous/current use of insulin Significant elevations in lipids , liver enzymes Menstrual period within the last 12 months Significant neurological or medical disorder ( other than AD ) Significant use of nasal decongestants Current use of anti-psychotic , anti-convulsive , anxiolytic , glucocorticoids , or sedative medications",60,0,50 Years,89 Years

"Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey",NCT01546857,Effect of Gabapentin on Orthopedic Pain,"Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey",4,0,Degenerative Arthritis and Postoperative Pain,Drug,Placebo,Treatment,Quadruple,"This study is being done to determine if a drug called gabapentin helps in the postoperative management of patients undergoing hip and knee operations . The investigators wish to determine the effect of gabapentin on pain and sleep following surgery . If we can lessen a patient 's pain and improve sleep , the patient will be better able to participate in their physical therapy . Gabapentin has already been shown to lessen postoperative pain when given before surgery . In healthy patients , it has also been shown to improve certain aspects of sleep . We hope to identify the effect of the drug , when given after surgery , on patients ' pain and sleep .","Recent studies have also supported the use of gabapentin as an adjuvant medication in postoperative pain management . Gabapentin decreased the pain associated with movement in post-mastectomy patients . Gilron et al showed a combination of gabapentin and rofecoxib superior to either medication alone in relieving pain after hysterectomy . Later , Gilron et al showed that adding meloxicam to gabapentin in patients undergoing outpatient laparoscopic surgery provided little additional benefit . Clarke et al demonstrated the decrease in the use of opioids in patients who received preoperative and postoperative gabapentin after total knee arthroplasty . They also noted that optimum timing and dosage of the gabapentin needed to be further elucidated . However , in the same year , Clarke et al also reported that gabapentin provided no benefit after total hip arthroplasty when a robust multimodal analgesic regimen was combined with spinal anesthesia . The side effects of gabapentin include sleepiness , which may be of benefit in the postoperative period . In a meta-analysis , Peng showed a 35 % decrease in total opioid consumption in the first 24 hours postoperatively . However , they did note an increase in sleepiness and dizziness . While a recent investigation did not find a connection between sleep disturbances and postoperative pain , a questionnaire study found that the most common reason for nighttime awakenings was pain , and that analgesia was the most helpful intervention . Gabapentin , a structural analogue to y-aminobutyric acid , has been shown in healthy subjects to increase SWS ; maintain a stable REM ; and reduce arousals , awakenings , and stage shifts-all of which are features of sleep fragmentation . Gabapentin is currently used to treat epilepsy , diabetic neuropathy , postherpetic neuralgia , as well as restless legs syndrome , and its effect on sleep patterns may attribute to its therapeutic success with these disorders Sleep deviates from the normal sleeping pattern in the postoperative patient . Total sleep time , proportion of REM sleep , and proportion of slow wave sleep ( SWS ) are all reduced . Sleep postoperatively tends to be highly fragmented with multiple spontaneous awakenings and movement arousals . Most of these changes occur during postoperative days 1 and 2 ; however , patients also incur a REM sleep rebound in days 3 and 4 that can extend up to a week . Studies have demonstrated that these postoperative sleep disturbances , notably the prolonged REM sleep rebound , may contribute to the development of altered mental function , postoperative episodic hypoxemia , and hemodynamic instability . A recent study even found that postoperative sleep disruptions independently predicted functional limitations three months following surgery in patients who underwent total knee replacement . The pathogenesis of these sleep changes appears to be strongly correlated to the magnitude of the surgery as opposed to the type of anesthesia used . Many specific mediators of surgical stress response have been indicated , including catecholamines , cortisol , and IL-1 ; however , as REM sleep is controlled by many regions of the brain , disturbances may be due to a global excitatory CNS effect . Our study will recruit 90 patients between the ages of 18 and 70 who are undergoing total hip arthroplasty , hip fracture repair , or total knee arthroplasty and have been assigned an ASA rating of I-III , who are not pregnant . After Institutional Review Board approval , a written informed consent will be obtained from the patient . The study protocol , use of the Patient Controlled Analgesia ( PCA ) pump , sleep scale , sedation scale , and visual analogue scale for pain will all be explained . Demographic information will be obtained including age , gender , past medical history , past surgical history , hospitalizations , current medications , allergies , and history of drug and alcohol abuse . In addition , a preoperative sleep history will be obtained using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index ( PSQI ) [ 14 , 15 ] . The 50 patients will be randomized into two groups : ( 1 ) placebo , ( 2 ) gabapentin . An Excel generated randomization schedule will be employed . The dosage of gabapentin administered will be 400mg . Prior to surgery , all patients will be administered midazolam 1-3mg IV to achieve anxiolysis . They will also receive a lumbar plexus block or a femoral nerve block , depending on the surgery to be done , as this has become the standard of care for orthopedic patients at University Hospital . All patients will receive celecoxib 200 mg po bid for three postoperative days . In the operating room , standard general anesthesia technique will be utilized . Upon extubation , the patient will be transferred to the postanesthesia care unit ( PACU ) , where baseline pain and sedation scores will be obtained using the Visual Acuity Scale ( VAS ) , the Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale ( RASS ) , and Ramsay Sedation Scale ( RSS ) , respectively . All pain scores will be assessed with subjects in the resting position . A continuous infusion of bupivacaine 0.125mg/L will be started at a rate of 10mL/hr and continued to postoperative day 2 . An I.V . PCA hydromorphone pump will be initiated and set to deliver a 0.2mg bolus per demand with a 5 minute lockout and no background infusion . All patients will be instructed to maintain their VAS pain score at less than 4 out of 10 . If the VAS pain score is 5 or greater at rest on two consecutive pain assessments , the dose of intravenous PCA hydromorphone will be increased to deliver a 0.3mg bolus per demand . At approximately 9pm on the day of the procedure the first dose of placebo/gabapentin will be given . The gabapentin or placebo treatment will be given once more at 9 pm on postoperative day 1 . The surgical team will be asked not to order any additional medication for sleep . The following mornings , on POD1 and POD2 , a questionnaire addressing the quality of sleep , hours of sleep , number of awakenings throughout the night , and contributing reasons for these awakenings ( pain , noise , urination , temperature discomfort , positional discomfort , for nursing care , or other reasons ) will be given . Patients will also be assessed for pain , sedation , as well as the incidence of any side effects , including nausea , vomiting , dizziness , and pruritus . In addition , all patients will begin an as-tolerated weight-bearing rehabilitation program for range of motion , strengthening , balance and ambulation beginning the first day after surgery . Success in completion of the physical therapy goals of being out of bed in a chair by postop day 1 and ambulating by postop day 2 will be determined for each group . The purpose of this study is to determine if a single dose of gabapentin decrease patients ' postoperative pain . The primary endpoint will be opioid consumption ; additional assessments will include : subjective sleep scales , pain scores , and patient 's ability to reach postoperative rehabilitation goals",2012-03-01,"January 13, 2021","Inclusion Criteria : Undergoing a hip arthroplasty , total knee arthroplasty , hip fracture repair American Society of Anesthesiologist rating I-III as determined by your anesthesiologist Exclusion Criteria : Pregnancy and breast feeding An allergy to any of the drugs to be used in the study ( midazolam , Celecoxib , gabapentin , hydromorphone , bupivacaine ) History of a sleep disorder ( Obstructive sleep apnea or daytime somnolence ) History of taking chronic narcotic pain medications or gabapentin History of rheumatoid arthritis , a psychiatric disorder , or diabetes with impaired renal function History of alcohol or illicit drug abuse .

Cataract surgery in patients with diabetic retinopathy is associated with progression of both retinopathy and maculopathy in nearly 23-57 % of cases , thus affecting the final visual outcome . Post-cataract surgery , macular edema may be due to worsening/presence of pre-existing clinically significant macular edema ( CSME ) or due to development of Irvine Gass Syndrome where cystoid macular edema ( CME ) occurs in the post operative period and is believed to be inflammatory in origin . Focal/ grid laser photocoagulation is the standard of care in the management of CSME , which may be pre-existing at the time of cataract surgery or worsens following surgery . Several adjuncts including intravitreal corticosteroids , Pegaptanib Sodium ( Macugen ; Pfizer , New York ) , Ranibizumab ( Lucentis ; Genentech , South San Francisco , California ) , Bevacizumab ( Avastin , Genentech ) have been tried in an attempt to improve the visual results .

Perioperative chemotherapy appears to have many advantages : to reduce the tumor volume , to improve the R0 resection rate , and to act on micro-metastases . Therefore , peri-operative chemotherapy combining cisplatin , epirubicin and 5-Fluorouracile is a validated strategy to treat gastric cancer . However , several pitfalls remained . Particularly , only 42 % of patients could received post-chemotherapy , due to post-operative complications and toxicities . To overcome this limitation , the investigators will conduct a phase II clinical trial assessing the clinical interest of a dose-dense preoperative chemotherapy combining cisplatin ( P ) , epirubicin ( E ) and paclitaxel ( T ) . The increasing evidence of taxane 's role in gastric cancer treatment , as well as the biological synergisms reported in paclitaxel/cisplatin and paclitaxel/epirubicin combinations , sustain the development of dose density based on PET combination in gastric carcinoma .

McGill University Health Centre/Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre,NCT01561274,ET 50 for Post Caesarean Section Spinal Hypotension,McGill University Health Centre/Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre,2,1,Hypotension,Drug,2 ml bupivacaine,Prevention,Quadruple,"Hypotension is extremely common after induction of spinal anesthesia for cesarean delivery . Anesthetic blockade of the sympathetic outflow of the spinal cord causes vasodilation , and is one cause of this hypotension . The higher the spread of the blockade will result in a higher incidence of hypotension . Injected hyperbaric medication has about 15 minutes to spread within the intrathecal space before it will be taken up by the nerve roots . The time that a patient remains in one position after medication injection will affect the spread of the resultant anesthetic block . A patient who is left sitting for a longer period of time after injection of hyperbaric medication will have a lower level of block than someone who is placed supine immediately . In this study , the investigators wish to use up down sequential analysis to determine the time period a patient should remain seated after intrathecal injection of hyperbaric bupivacaine that will result in a 50 % rate of hypotension .","Up down sequential analysis is a method developed by Dixon to determine the point where 50 % of people will have a positive response and 50 % will have a negative response to an intervention . It is a very powerful technique that has been used to determine the median effective dose ( referred to as ED50 ) of many medications . Using this method , patient number 1 is given a certain amount of the intervention being studied . If patient 1 has the desired response , patient 2 in the series is given less of the intervention , and if patient 1 does not have the desired response , patient 2 is given more of the intervention . This is repeated through a series of patients until the dose where there is a 50 % response rate is determined . In this study , we wish to use up down sequential analysis to determine the time period a patient should remain seated after intrathecal injection of hyperbaric medication that result in a 50 % rate of hypotension , what we will call the ET50 ( Estimated Time for 50 % of patients to have hypotension ) . We would like to explore this relationship with 2 clinically used doses of hyperbaric bupivicaine . Patients scheduled for cesarean delivery arrive in the birthing centre 1-2 The patients will be given the same anesthetic care routinely used in the birthing centre , except that we will control the time that the patient remains seated after injection of intrathecal hyperbaric bupivacaine . The baseline blood pressure and heart rate will be recorded . After intravenous access is obtained , an infusion of normal saline will be commenced at a rate of 100 cc per hour . The patient will be brought to the operating room , and the standard monitors will be placed . The intravenous fluid will be administered at a rate of 500 ml per hour for one hour . The patient will be placed in a sitting position . The landmarks of the spinal canal will be identified with an ultrasound , then using sterile technique , an epidural catheter will be placed in the L2-L3 spinal interspace , and then a 27 gauge whitacre needle will be used to access the intrathecal space at the L4-L5 spinal interspace . After identification of the intrathecal space , hyperbaric bupivacaine will be injected over 30 seconds . The patient will then be left in the sitting position for the predetermined time . The patient will then be placed supine , with a 15 degree wedge under the right hip . The noninvasive blood pressure will be set to measure the blood pressure every minute . Hypotension will be defined as a drop in blood pressure to more than 20 % of the patient 's preoperative blood pressure . The medications used for treatment of hypotension will be left to the discretion of the treating anesthesiologist . The height of the anesthetic blockade will be measured bilaterally with ice at 1 , 5 , 10 , 15 , and 20 minutes after the patient has been placed supine . If the block has not reached T6 by 20 minutes after the patient has assumed the supine position , or if the patient experiences any pain during the cesarean delivery , 5 ml of 2 % lidocaine will be administered through the epidural catheter . If this does not suitably manage the pain , the treating anesthesiologist will be allowed to manage the pain as they see fit . Determination of the time in the sitting position : The study patient will be considered a success if the duration of time in the sitting position results in no pre-delivery hypotension . The study patient will be considered a failure if the time spent in the sitting position results in pre-delivery hypotension . A patient will be considered an indeterminate result if the ice test fails to show a block reaching T6 by 15 minutes . A patient following a success will be left in the sitting position for 15 seconds less than the preceding patient , and the patient following a failure will be left in the sitting position for 15 seconds more than the preceding patient . A patient following an indeterminate result will remain in the sitting position for the same time as the preceding patient . The first patient in the series will be left in the sitting position for 3 minutes after the injection of the intrathecal medication . Dosage determination and blinding : To see if ET50 is dependent on the dosage of medication given , we will determine the ET50 for 2 doses of hyperbaric bupivicaine . Both of the doses we will study are used routinely in clinical practice . Using a computerized randomization schedule , we will randomly assign patients to receive either 2 ml or 1.5 ml of 0.75 % hyperbaric bupivacaine , for a total of 15 mg or 12.5 mg of bupivacaine respectively . Recorded data : We will record the demographic data of the patient , including height , weight , age , gravidity , parity , weeks gestation , and reason for the cesarean delivery . We will record the medical history of the patient , and medications that the patient takes . We will record the admission heart rate , blood pressure and saturation . We will record the time that the intrathecal medication is injected , and the time that that the patient remains seated after the spinal anesthesia has been commenced . We will record the level of anesthetic blockade at 1,5,10,15 , and 20 minutes after the patient has been placed supine . We will record the blood pressure , and heart rate every minute after the patient has been placed supine until the baby has been delivered . We will record any medications used to treat blood pressure before the baby has been born , and any medications used to treat breakthrough pain . We will record the birth time , the baby gender , weight , apgar , and umbilical cord pH .",2012-03-20,"June 20, 2014","Inclusion Criteria : Patients 18 years or older , presenting for scheduled cesarean delivery to the C7 birthing centre .

It will also aim to investigate capability of the treatment in the maintenance of remission after four weeks of treatment interruption ; histological changes will be also evaluated and finally , improvement in the overall quality of life as measured by the Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire ( SIBDQ ) will be investigated .","Although it seems clear that an abnormal function of the colonic epithelium is the central problem causing inflammation and the unusual immunological response to the normal gut flora in inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) , the actual causes of these dysfunctions are still unknown . Short Chain Fatty Acids ( SCFA ) are the main fuel of the colonic epithelium , and are normally produced by the bacterial flora by fermentation of the complex carbohydrates forming non soluble fibers usually introduced with everyday diet . Butyrate alone contributes 70 % of the normal colonocyte energy . Studies done using animal models and colonic mucosa biopsies from patients suffering form ulcerative colitis ( UC ) have consistently shown that a metabolic change occurs in diseased colonic mucosa , with an impairment of butyrate oxidation ( and of beta-oxidation ) and an energy shortage that is only incompletely compensated by oxidation of glucose and other substrates such as glutamine . It is also well known that matrix metalloproteases production is highly increased in IBD and that serum transglutaminase activity is significantly reduced in patients with IBD . Transglutaminases are enzymes contributing to the crosslinking of matrix proteins and the reduction seen in patients affected by IBD correlates well with the endoscopic and histopathologic grading in UC , meaning that part of the circulating enzyme is sequestered in the injured colonic tissue in the effort to re-build the extracellular matrix during the healing process . Propionyl-L-carnitine Hydrochloride ( PLC ) is a molecule that has already been shown to reduce membrane lipid peroxidation in endothelial cells from bovine aorta and coronary vessels , to reduce the effects of hypoxia in coronary endothelial cells , and to play a role in the cardiac metabolic abnormalities that contribute to the mechanical dysfunctions leading to heart failure . Given these properties of Propionyl-L-carnitine Hydrochloride ( ST 261 ) and given the peroxidative damage suffered by colonocytes in UC together with their metabolic impairment , the use of this molecule for the treatment of UC seemed to be appropriate and sound , in particular as a carrier of a propionate moiety that , once transformed into succinate , enters the Kreb cycle , acting as an extra burst fuel improving the balance of energy production inside tissues . Previous clinical experience has shown that PLC promoted complete or nearly complete regression of cutaneous trophic ulcers in a large number of vasculopathic patients refractory to all other therapies . As far as the UC pathology is concerned , the effects of ST 261 , given orally or intrarectally , were investigated at different dosages , in preclinical experimentation , either after a single trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid ( TNBS ) administration ( acute colitis ) or after repeated TNBS administrations ( reactivated colitis ) . The results showed a reduction in the damaged colon area both in acute model and reactivated colitis , even if the beneficial effect of restoration of TNBS-induced alterations of tissue morphology is more evident in the reactivated colitis model , particularly after oral administration . Based on the above-described results a development plan in humans started to investigate the activity of PLC in the treatment of ulcerative colitis .",2012-03-28,"November 4, 2016","Inclusion Criteria : Have read the Information for the Patient and signed the Informed Consent Form .

IBD represent a public health problem in Gastroenterology . The etiopathogeny of IBD is multifactorial involving immunological , genetic , infectious and environmental factors . An overarching hypothesis is that an unbalance of the autonomic nervous system , represented by the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system ( e.g . the vagus nerve ) is part of the mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of IBD . A dysautonomia has been observed in IBD patients and we have recently demonstrated that this dysautonomia was linked to psychological coping , in particular in Crohn 's disease . Classically , the vagus nerve , a mixed nerve , has an anti-inflammatory role through its central afferents which secondarily stimulate the hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal axis . Recent data have shown that the anti-inflammatory properties of the vagus nerve also involve peripheral efferents via an interaction of acetylcholine with nicotinic receptors leading to an inhibition of TNF release by macrophages . Vagus nerve stimulation ( VNS ) is currently used for the treatment of some forms of epilepsy in Human via a stimulation of vagal afferents . We have recently validated a model of chronic VNS ( 3h/d for 5 days ) in freely moving rats by stimulating vagal efferents and we have studied the anti-inflammatory properties of VNS in an experimental model of colitis in rats . VNS significantly decreased body weight loss due to colitis and had an anti-inflammatory effect by decreasing a multivariate index of inflammation . To date , medical treatment of IBD ( e.g . 5-aminosalicylates , corticosteroids , immunosuppressives or biotherapies i.e . anti-TNF ) is only suspensive . The aim of our project is to propose another type of anti-inflammatory treatment based on neurostimulation of vagal efferents . For this purpose , we aim to perform a pilot study in 10 patients with moderate to severe Crohn 's disease despite a reference treatment ( corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressives ) using the anti-inflammatory properties of VNS as an alternative to anti-TNF therapy . Central and peripheral effect of VNS will be also evaluated by electroencephalographic and sympatho-vagal ( heart rate variability ) recordings . The finality , at term , is to use VNS as an alternative to the conventional anti-TNF therapy not devoid of side effects , in particular infectious , with the advantage to use an intrinsic anti-inflammatory ( anti-TNF ) system and to take cover of problems of adherence to treatment which are frequently observed in the medical treatment of IBD .",2012-03-30,"May 2, 2018","Inclusion Criteria : Patients with CD involving the ileo-colon , diagnosed for at least 3 months prior to screening in flare ( 220 < CDAI5mg/l and/or fecal calprotectin 7 ( Crohn 's disease endoscopic index of severity ) Consenting patient Exclusion Criteria : Known cardiac pathology VNS contraindication Anoperineal CD only or associated with ileocolic lesion Diagnosis of indeterminate colitis , positive stool culture for enteric pathogens CD Surgery within 3 months before screening Short small intestine ( < 1m ) Koenig syndrome Intra-abdominal abscess Fistula with clinical or radiological abscess evidence Anoperineal CD with or without rectal involvement Ileostomy , colostomy , enteral or parenteral feeding Clinical condition medically or surgically unstable that , at the discretion of the investigator would not be compatible with the patient 's participation in the study Any recent neoplasia , in the year prior to screening",9,0,18 Years,65 Years

Aragon Institute of Health Sciences,NCT01566474,Melatonin Associated to Acid Inhibition for Chemoprevention in Barret Esophagus: a Pilot Study,Aragon Institute of Health Sciences,3,1,Barrett's Esophagus,Drug,Omeprazole,Prevention,Single,"The study consists on determining whether melatonin decreases oxidative stress in Barrett 's esophageal mucosa after 6 months of treatment . In order to achieve the clinical trial , the patients will be randomized to two possible arms : omeprazole alone or omeprazole plus melatonin . The patients will be followed around four visits during six months . GERD is one of the most prevalent pathologies in the digestive tract . Barrett 's esophagus , a complication of chronic GERD , has attracted the attention of researchers due to its condition of pre-neoplastic lesion . At present , treatment of Barrett 's patients is limited to acid inhibition with PPIs . Although there are several studies which indicate that treatment with PPIs could decrease the incidence of high grade dysplasia and EAC , treatment with PPIs does not eliminate the risk of EAC in these patients . Therefore , it is necessary to find chemo-preventive agents that stop neoplastic progression of Barrett 's esophagus . Among them , antioxidants have become the most promising agent . This pilot study will determine the efficacy of melatonin in the chemoprevention of EAC . So , the main objective of this study is to determine whether melatonin decreases oxidative stress in Barrett 's esophageal mucosa after 6 months of treatment . To evaluate whether melatonin modifies other mechanisms associated to neoplastic progression in BE patients : proliferation and apoptotic index and molecular markers of progression : 17pLOH , 9pLOH , p16 methylation and DNA ploidy ( tetraploidy and/or aneuploidy ) .","Barrett 's esophagus ( BE ) is a chronic disease secondary to the presence of stomach acid into the esophagus . This atypical situation produces an inflammation and ulceration of the distal esophagus mucosa . It is the main factor predisposing to the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma , which has a very poor prognosis . At present , therapy of Barrett 's esophagus is based on acid secretion inhibition with proton pump inhibitors , which is a very effective therapy to reduce gastroesophageal reflux . However , this therapy does not completely eliminate this risk . Therefore , the better way to follow this disorder is to perform periodic upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and biopsies . Therefore , it is necessary to find new chemo-preventive agents that avoid more efficiently the neoplastic progression of BE . New advances in knowledge about BE suggest that antioxidants could be used to reduce the disorder development . These drugs are being used for long time ago in different pathologies in a lot of countries . One of these drugs is melatonin , which combines several characteristics that suggest it could be the most suitable antioxidant . It has no adverse effects reported . Patients that meet the following characteristics will be included in this clinical study : Patients ( males and females ) with Barrett 's esophagus ( > 18 years and < 80 ) without macroscopic esophagitis at endoscopy and a length of the metaplasic mucosa of 2 cm or longer . By the same way , patients will be excluded of the study if present carcinoma or high grade dysplasia at basal endoscopy , previous gastric or esophageal surgery , patients on NSAID or aspirin treatment , neoplastic malignancies , hematological serious diseases ( coagulation disorders and anemia with Hb < 9.5 gr/dL ) , serious/moderate cardiac , liver or renal diseases , need of corticosteroid therapy ( a minimum of 5 days per month is allowed , as well as topical or inhaled treatment ) , patients on misoprostol or anticoagulants , patients with inflammatory bowel disease and allergy to investigational drugs . Patients , who agree to participate in the study and meet criteria , will be randomized to one of the two following therapies : omeprazole alone or omeprazole + Circadin ( melatonin. ) . This intervention hardly produces any adverse effects , the most frequent adverse effects of proton pump inhibitors are headache and stomach ache . For melatonin has not reported any adverse effect . This study will be done in the Hospital Clinico Lozano Blesa ( Zaragoza , Spain ) , promoted by the Health Science Aragon Institute and its principal investigator is Angel Lanas Arbeloa ( Digestive Disease Service ) .

Radboud University Medical Center,NCT01577212,Individualized Dose Prescription in Advanced Stage Lung Cancer Patients Using Modern (Chemo)Radiotherapy,Radboud University Medical Center,2,0,Stage III Non-small Cell Lung Cancer,Radiation,Individualized dose escalation,Treatment,,"The aim of this present study is to test the feasibility and toxicity of individualized hypofractionated radiotherapy , and to report outcome data . In case this phase II trial has favorable results , a phase II/III trial on maximally tolerable , individualized , hypofractionated radiotherapy within a shorter overall-treatment time is aimed for .","In the Netherlands , approximately 10.000 new patients are diagnosed with lung cancer every year . Of these , 80 % present with non-small-cell lung cancer . Between 1995 and 2008 , the national incidence has risen with 16 % caused by an impressive increase of 53 % in women suffering from this disease . The aggressive nature of this disease leads to a one-year survival rate of 45 % and a 5-year survival rate of only 14 % . It is widely accepted that surgery provides the best chance of cure in patients with operable NSCLC ( www.oncoline.nl ) . In practice , only 20 % of patients are amenable for tumor resection with curative intent . Alternatively , stereotactic body radiation therapy ( SBRT ) results in excellent local control in localized early stage disease . In locally advanced , inoperable disease , combined chemotherapy and external-beam radiotherapy ( EBRT ) are increasingly being used . Evidence suggests that concurrent schedules are more effective than sequential treatments despite increased toxicity , although the true magnitude of the additional benefit remains uncertain . However , a large number of patients with locally advanced NSCLC is not suitable for concurrent chemoradiotherapy due to their general condition , age , comorbidity or tumor-related factors . Therefore , there is a need to increase effectiveness of treatment for all patients with advanced stage NSCLC undergoing either radiotherapy alone , neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy , or concurrent treatment . Apart from the addition of chemotherapy , treatment modification by intensification of the radiotherapy schedule or by dose escalation has been proven beneficial . Several phase I/II trials explored altered EBRT fractionation schedules that increased the biological effective dose to the primary tumor and reduced local relapse rate . Thereby , two main principles were pursued : reduction of the dose per fraction ( ≤ 1.8 Gy ) , giving two or three fractions per day ( so-called hyperfractionation ) , aimed at sparing normal tissues while increasing the dose to the primary tumor ; increase of the fraction dose ( ≥ 2 Gy ) , combined with a reduction in the total number of fractions ( so-called hypofractionation ) aimed at increasing the effective tumor dose in less radiation-sensitive primary tumors . On the one hand , hyperfractionation limits the treatment-related side-effects , on the other hypofractionation is attractive for the patient and radiation department as the number of treatment fractions can be reduced . Intensification of the irradiation schedule by continuous , hyperfractionated radiotherapy ( CHART ) delivered in 12 consecutive days showed an absolute improvement in two-year survival . With the advent of highly conformal dose planning and delivery techniques during the last decade ( i.e. , 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy , 3D-CRT ; intensity-modulated radiation therapy , IMRT ; volumetric-modulated arc therapy , VMAT/RapidArc ; Tomotherapy ) , organ-sparing technology became widely available . Recently , van Baardwijk and collaborators published an individualized dose prescription study in 166 stage-III NSCLC patients . Already in 2006 , Belderbos et al . reported favorable toxicity data and an encouraging failure-free interval in 88 inoperable NSCLC patients treated with intensified , hypofractionated 3D-CRT based on the MTD to the lung . Apart from these reported studies , there are three hypofractionation trials being conducted elsewhere . In the UK , two 3D-CRT based phase I/II trials have been approved investigating individualized dose escalation based on normal tissue dose constraints in patients with stage II or stage III NSCLC ( ISRCTN12155469 and I-START ; CRUK/10/005 ) . In the US , the University of Wisconsin is conducting a helical tomotherapy-based hypofractionation study ( NCT00214123 ) with pulmonary toxicity ( pneumonitis grade 3 lasting for more than 2 weeks ) as primary endpoint . The reported hypo- and hyperfractionation studies have a 'trial-and-error ' approach for dose-level estimation in common . In a recent in silico trial in 26 stage III NSCLC patients , we have investigated the use of a dedicated software tool for individual dose escalation by hypofractionation . Based on an existing , clinical IMRT/VMAT treatment plan ( 66 Gy in 33 fractions ) , radiation dose was escalated by scaling the radiation dose until the maximum tolerated dose constraints for the healthy lung , the esophagus , spinal cord , brachial plexus or heart was met . The aim of this present study is to test the feasibility and toxicity of individualized hypofractionated radiotherapy , and to report outcome data . In case this phase II trial has favorable results , a phase II/III trial on maximally tolerable , individualized , hypofractionated radiotherapy within a shorter overall-treatment time is aimed for .",2012-03-16,"November 6, 2015","Inclusion Criteria : Histologically or cytologically confirmed stage IIIA/B NSCLC ( excluding pleural effusion and mixed pathology ) Irresectable disease ( as assessed by multidisciplinary team ) or patient refusing surgery Disease which can be encompassed within a radical radiotherapy treatment plan in keeping with standard practice at the participating center Proposed treatment consists of radiotherapy alone or concurrent chemoradiation WHO performance status 0 or 1 Adequate respiratory function : FEV1 ≥ 1.5 L and DLCO > 40 % , predicted on baseline pulmonary function tests Age ≥ 18 years , no upper age limit Estimated life expectancy of more than 6 months Patient is available for follow-up Written informed consent obtained Exclusion Criteria : Clinically diagnosed NSCLC Previous or current malignant disease likely to interfere with the protocol treatment or comparisons Prior thoracic radiotherapy Proposed treatment consist of sequential chemoradiation Prior lobectomy / pneumonectomy Prior chemotherapy using gemcitabine or bleomycine Superior sulcus tumors if the brachial plexus is within the high-dose volume Medically unstable ( e.g. , ischaemic heart disease , esophageal disorders ) Pregnancy Connective tissue disorders Abnormal kidney function interfering with administration of iv contrast agent ( GFR < 60 ) Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus hampering 18FDG-PET Inability to comply with protocol or trial procedures",6,0,18 Years,85 Years
"The University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston",NCT01574131,Acute and Long-Term Outcome Investigations of Fenofibrate on Severely Burned Patients,"The University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston",4,0,Second or Third Degree Burns,Drug,Fenofibrate,Treatment,Double,The purpose of this study is to learn the following : whether long-term treatment ( 6 months ) with fenofibrate will decrease burn related sugar and fat increased in the blood and help prevent muscle loss and improve wound healing .,"Following severe burn injury in human patients the mitochondrial fat oxygenation capacity is decreased in muscle . This is associated with a corresponding progression in the severity of the resistance to the action of insulin on glucose disposal and protein synthesis and breakdown in muscle , regenerating wound and liver . Fatty acids or their active intracellular products ( e.g . Diacylglycerol , acyl- Coenzyme A ( CoA ) or acylcarnitine ) are the direct inhibitors of insulin action , rather than tissue triglycerides ( TG ) itself . In other words , impaired mitochondrial fatty acid oxygenation is the mechanism that causes altered lipid metabolism that ultimately contributes to insulin resistance . Accumulation of active fatty acid products , such as Diacylglycerol , acyl-CoA or acylcarnitine esters in muscle cells is due to the rate of uptake of plasma free fatty acids ( FFA ) exceeding the rate of oxygenation within muscle due principally to a reduced capacity of mitochondria to oxidize fatty acids . Decreasing insulin sensitivity in muscle is related to impaired insulin signaling . This will be reflected by increased activity of protein kinase C ( PKC ) . Because PKC is thought to exert its regulatory effect primarily on either tyrosine kinase activity on the insulin receptor or downstream kinase insulin receptor substrate ( IRS ) phosphorylation , these elements of the insulin signaling cascade will be decreased . In turn , elements of insulin signaling related to the response of muscle glucose ( PI3 Kinase ) and protein ( P70S6k ) metabolism will be reduced . The investigators propose that increased tissue PKC activity will be associated with increased tissue concentration of Diacylglycerol , acyl-CoA or acylcarnitine . The investigators hypothesize that the treatment of patients with the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ( PPAR ) alpha antagonist fenofibrate will improve mitochondrial capacity to oxidize fatty acids . Insulin sensitivity in muscle , skin and liver in terms of both glucose and protein metabolism will be improved by fenofibrate treatment .",2012-03-22,"November 26, 2019","Inclusion Criteria : ≥40 % Burn ages 4-20years body weight ≥10kg Exclusion Criteria : < 40 % burn ages 20 years body weight 3mg/dL Serum Creatinine > 3mg/dL after fluid resuscitation Glutamyl-Oxaloacetic Transaminase ( GOT ) > 40 Units/L Glutamyl-Pyruvate Transminase ( GPT ) > 51 Units/L Associated head injuries requiring therapy Associated injuries to the chest or abdomen requiring surgery Receipt of any experimental drug other than the ones supplied within two months of study Any metal in body including rods , cardiac defibrillators , pacemaker , etc Orthopedic casting which would prevent placement in MRI Hepatitis Abnormal EKG Electrical burns",3,0,4 Years,20 Years

This experience , together with the need for new strategies for high-risk pediatric gliomas has motivated the conduct of this study .","Tumours of the brain and of the central nervous system ( CNS ) are the most common solid tumours in children . Amongst these , gliomas are the most frequent , although this term covers different histological subtypes , the most frequent being astrocytoma . However , they are rare diseases of low prevalence . The mortality rate of pediatric CNS cancer has not decreased in the same proportion as other tumours in children . High grade gliomas have a unfavorable prognosis with few therapeutic options . The objective response rate ( ORR ) of these tumours to chemotherapy ranges from 11 % to 27 % , in the best of cases . Relapsed high-grade gliomas and intrinsic brain stem tumours have a uniformly fatal outcome despite all the treatments tested . The treatment of adults with de novo glioblastoma after surgical resection is local radiotherapy concomitant to temozolomide . This approach in children is still under clinical assessment . In the case of low-grade astrocytomas , the indication for adjuvant therapy is limited to patients with unresectable tumours that also cause a neurological lesion . Although they are slow growing tumours , they can cause severe morbidity and are life-threatening . Radiotherapy has known side effects on the nervous system in children . Chemotherapy is used to delay or avoid radiotherapy in these patients . Most of the radiological studies that evaluate treatment response of gliomas focus on measuring the area of the lesion . However , nowadays new imaging strategies and functional tests such as PET can be applied . The uptake of the 11C methionine tracer in tumour tissue is more selective than that of glucose and provides good delineation for the evaluation of these tumours . There are few studies on the molecular and genetic characteristics of gliomas in children . In adults , it has been reported that microsatellite instability is a predictive factor of the tumour response to irinotecan , because the defect in the DNA repair proteins results in a greater sensitivity to the drug . Furthermore , in adults , 30-40 % of the high grade astrocytomas show MGMT promotor methylation and as a consequence the methylated tumours are more sensitive to the effect of alkylating drugs . Due to the lack of pediatric studies on MGMT promoter methylation and on microsatellites the question as to whether their determination has the same importance as in high grade glioma in adults can not be answered . Irinotecan is a prodrug of the camptothecin family . Phase I and Phase II clinical trials using irinotecan in pediatric patients with different neoplasias demonstrate that irinotecan is well tolerated . The weekly administration of irinotecan and cisplatin in Phase I trials showed that treatment is well tolerated and the dose reached was 65 mg/m2 of irinotecan weekly together with cisplatin 30 mg/m2 weekly . The interest in the cisplatin/irinotecan combination in brain tumours motivated a previous pilot study at our hospital , with encouraging results . This experience , together with the need for new strategies for high-risk pediatric gliomas has motivated the conduct of this study . The impact of this study , if treatment proves to be effective , will be highly significant , given the poor response of gliomas to the adjuvant treatment used so far . Pediatric gliomas are of low incidence and may be considered as `` orphan '' diseases , and therefore as low priority as regards funding . However , because of their unfavorable prognosis these diseases have high clinical and social repercussions , especially high grade gliomas and high risk low grade gliomas , with less mortality but a high incidence of sequelae .

Therefore , mantle cell lymphoma is known as one of the B-cell lymphomas with poor prognosis . Although the treatment outcome of mantle cell lymphoma has been improved since intensive chemotherapy regimens such as HyperCVAD was used , a substantial number of patients are still frequently relapsed after chemotherapy . After relapse , most of them became refractory to various kinds of salvage treatment . That is why the results of most salvage chemotherapy regimens were disappointing . In addition , mantle cell lymphoma generally occurs in elderly people . Thus , intensive salvage chemotherapy may not be feasible for elderly patients . Therefore , an effective , novel combination treatment is urgently needed in relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma patients . Hypothesis Vorinostat will produce synergism with a combination treatment regimen ( Fludarabine , mitoxantrone , dexamethasone , FND ) without overlapping toxicity Vorinostat maintenance treatment will reduce the relapse rate in patients ineligible for autologous stem cell transplantation .

Peak aortic jet velocity is known to be associated with clinical outcomes in mild and moderate AS , and our previous study showed that rate of progression was significantly associated with baseline aortic jet velocity in mild aortic stenosis . Because beta-blocker therapy would decrease aortic jet velocity and heart rate , it might decrease hemodynamic stress and eventually slow down the degenerative process in patients whose disease is not too advanced for therapy to be effective . The investigators hypothesized that a beta-blocker therapy would decrease the rate of progression of aortic stenosis by modifying hemodynamic factors favorably in patients with mild to moderate aortic stenosis .","Aortic stenosis ( AS ) is a gradually progressive disease , characterized by an increase in calcium deposition leading to progressive narrowing of the aortic valve ( AV ) . There are currently no effective medical treatment to halt the disease process and surgical valve replacement remains the only proven therapy when the valve becomes severely stenotic . AS is mediated by a chronic inflammatory disease process , very similar to that seen in atherosclerosis , but lipid-lowering therapy did not slow the progression of AS in the SALTIRE , SEAS , or ASTRONOMER trials . It is possible that these trials may have targeted patients in whom disease was too advanced for lipid-lowering therapy to be effective , or in whom atherosclerotic mechanism was not the central pathogenic process in AS . Because identifying and treating patients in earlier stages of AS would not be cost-effective , it seems more logical to explore alternative pharmacological approaches .

"Insel Gruppe AG, University Hospital Bern",NCT01574014,Glucocorticoid Treatment for Social Phobia,"Insel Gruppe AG, University Hospital Bern",2,0,Phobic Disorders,Behavioral,CBGT,Treatment,Triple,"Social phobia is the third most common psychiatric disorder besides depression and alcoholism . Several studies have demonstrated the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy in the treatment of social phobia . Nevertheless , there is no effect in a third of the people at the existing treatment methods . Pharmacological therapies have similar effects , but there is a high rate of relapse after discontinuation of medication . Social phobia is characterized by fear of performance or interaction situations . The strong fear of negative evaluation by others is usually accompanied by a marked avoidance behavior and increased physical symptoms such as blushing , sweating , palpitations , or tremors . The confrontation with a phobic stimulus leads to a retrieval of stimulus-associated aversive memories , resulting in an immediate anxiety response . Several studies had already shown that elevated glucocorticoids impair retrieval of declarative memory contents in healthy subjects . The investigators demonstrated an anxiety-reducing effect after the administration of cortisone before the confrontation with a phobic stimulus in patients with social and spider phobia .","Background Anxiety disorders have major public health significance and social phobia ranks as the third most common mental health disorder after depression and alcoholism . Even though cognitive-behavioral therapy ( CBT ) is the most effective non-pharmacological approach to the treatment of social phobia , more than one third of the patients do not respond to treatment , or achieve only partial remission of symptoms . Pharmacotherapy ( e.g. , SSRIs , benzodiazepines ) has been shown to be effective in the acute treatment of social phobia , however , with high rates of relapse when medication is discontinued . In addition , the combination of CBT and medication does not seem to be more beneficial than CBT alone . Consequently , the development of innovative psychobiological approaches combining effective psychotherapy methods with synergizing substance administration is a primary challenge in interdisciplinary research on treatment of social phobia . In a recent study the investigators found evidence that a pharmacological elevation of glucocorticoid levels reduces fear in patients with social phobia and spider phobia exposed to a phobic stimulus . Furthermore , the investigators have shown that repeated administration of glucocorticoids before exposure to a phobic stimulus leads to an extinction of phobic fear . Also the low-dose administration of cortisone over a month in patients with post-traumatic stress disorder reduces cardinal of symptoms the disorder . Based on these findings , glucocorticoid treatment , in combination with exposure therapy , may help to reduce fear and promote extinction of phobic fear . In an interdisciplinary research project involving psychology , behavioral pharmacology psychiatry , genetics and neuroimaging the investigators propose to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of combining an exposure-based cognitive-behavioral group therapy ( CBGT ) with hydrocortisone treatment . The investigators hypothesize that hydrocortisone exerts both acute beneficial effects by reducing fear during exposure , and long-term beneficial effects by facilitating the extinction of phobic fear . Furthermore , the investigators hypothesize differential treatment responses depending on genetic variations in glucocorticoid-related genes ( substudy 1 ) . These hypotheses will be tested in a clinical study with 100 patients with mainly speech anxiety who fulfill DSM-IV criteria for a diagnosis of social phobia and 60 patients with spider phobia . This is the first study aimed at determining the therapeutic efficacy of combining hydrocortisone administration and a short-term exposure-based cognitive-behavioral group therapy for the treatment of social phobic patients with specific speech anxiety and patients with spider phobia . Considering the large number of patients suffering from social phobia , the suggested interdisciplinary project will have important clinical implications for the development of a more effective therapy . Objective To determine whether short-term treatment with 20 mg hydrocortisone enhances the efficacy of exposure-based cognitive-behavioral group therapy ( CBGT ) in patients with social phobia , specifically speech anxiety and patients with spider phobia . A series of studies indicate that elevated glucocorticoid levels inhibit the retrieval of memory in healthy humans . Further the low-dose administration of glucocorticoids over a month inhibited the retrieval of traumatic memories in patients with post traumatic stress disorder . These findings suggest that glucocorticoids might also inhibit retrieval of fear memory in phobia and social phobia exposed to a phobic stimulus . Additionally , the investigators found evidence indicating that repeated administration of glucocorticoids before exposure to a phobic stimulus leads to an extinction of phobic fear . Based on these findings , glucocorticoid treatment , in combination with exposure therapy , may help to reduce fear and promote extinction of phobic fear . Methods In a placebo-controlled double-blind study design , patients will be randomly assigned to receive CBGT + hydrocortisone ( Social Phobia : N=50 / Spider Phobia : N=30 ) or CBGT + placebo ( Social Phobia : N=50 / Spider Phobia : N=30 ) . Psychopathological symptoms and stress reactivity will be assessed by psychometric and endocrine parameters before , during and after CBGT therapy . The patients have further the possibility to attend to a neuroimaging study , in which the investigators examine and localize the anxiolytic effect of acute glucocorticoid administration in the brain ( substudy 2 ) . In this substudy 2 the investigators compare the patients with social phobia with patients with specific spider phobia and healthy controls as they did in their previous studies ( Soravia et al . 2006 ) .",2012-03-14,"December 4, 2012",Inclusion Criteria : Age ( 20-55 ) Spider Phobia Right Handed Social Phobia Exclusion Criteria : Other Psychiatric Disorder / Comorbidities Smoking more than 15 cigarettes per day Medication Contraceptives Physical illness Neurological disease Drug abuse,66,0,20 Years,55 Years
M.D. Anderson Cancer Center,NCT01572662,Allogeneic Transplantation Using Timed Sequential Busulfan and Fludarabine Conditioning,M.D. Anderson Cancer Center,2,1,Leukemia,Drug,Fludarabine monophosphate,Treatment,,"The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if giving busulfan and fludarabine before a stem cell transplant can help control the disease better than the standard method in patients with leukemia , lymphoma , multiple myeloma , MDS , or MPD . In this study , 2 doses of busulfan will be given 2 weeks before a stem cell transplant followed by 4 doses of busulfan and fludarabine during the week before the stem cell transplant , rather than the standard method of giving 4 doses of busulfan and fludarabine only during the week before the stem cell transplant . The safety of this combination therapy will also be studied . Busulfan is designed to kill cancer cells by binding to DNA ( the genetic material of cells ) , which may cause cancer cells to die . Busulfan is commonly used in stem cell transplants . Fludarabine is designed to interfere with the DNA of cancer cells , which may cause the cancer cells to die .","Central Venous Catheter : If you choose to take part in this study , the chemotherapy , some of the other drugs in this study , and the stem cell transplant will be given by vein through your central venous catheter ( CVC ) . A CVC is a sterile flexible tube and needle that will be placed into a large vein while you are under local anesthesia . Blood samples will also be drawn through your CVC . The CVC will remain in your body during treatment . Your doctor will explain this procedure to you in more detail , and you will be required to sign a separate consent form . Study Drug Administration and Procedures : For a stem cell transplant , the days before you receive your stem cells are called minus days . The day you receive the stem cells is called Day 0 . The days after you receive the stem cells are called plus days . You will receive a dose of busulfan by vein over about 3 hours on Day -13 and Day -12 . With the Day -13 busulfan infusion , about 11 samples of blood ( about 1-2 teaspoons each time ) will be drawn for pharmacokinetic ( PK ) testing at various time points before and after you receive your first dose of busulfan . The study staff will tell you the blood testing schedule . PK testing measures the amount of study drug in the body at different time points . The PK testing will help the doctor decide your dose of busulfan for Days -6 through -3 . If needed , PK blood testing may also be done on Day -6 during your dose of Busulfan . You may receive the Day -13 and Day -12 busulfan dose either as an outpatient in the clinic or as an inpatient in the hospital . A heparin lock line will be placed in your vein to lower the number of needle sticks needed for these draws . If it is not possible for the PK tests to be performed for technical reasons , you will be taken off study and receive the standard fixed dose of busulfan . On Days -13 and -12 , you will receive busulfan by vein over 3 hours . On Days -11 through -7 , you will rest . On Days -6 through -3 , you will receive fludarabine by vein over 1 hour , then busulfan by vein over 3 hours . On Days -2 and -1 , you will rest . On Day 0 , you will receive the stem cell transplant by vein . After the transplant , you will receive tacrolimus , methotrexate , or other drugs to weaken the immune system in the standard manner to lower the risk of graft-vs-host disease ( GVHD ) , a reaction of the donor 's immune cells against the recipient 's body . You will receive tacrolimus by vein as a nonstop infusion until you are able to take it by mouth to help lower the risk of GVHD . You will then take tacrolimus by mouth 2 times a day for about 3 months . After that , your tacrolimus dose may be lowered if you do not have GVHD . Your doctor will discuss this with you . On Days 1 , 3 , and 6 , if your stem cells are from a related or matched unrelated donor , you will receive methotrexate over 30 minutes each day by vein to help lower the risk of GVHD . Participants receiving a matched unrelated donor will also receive methotrexate on Day 11 after the transplant . You will receive filgrastim as an injection under the skin 1 time a day , starting 1 week after the transplant , until your blood cell levels return to normal . Filgrastim is designed to help with the growth of white blood cells . Study Testing : While you are in the hospital , you will be checked for any side effects as part of your standard of care . Blood ( about 2 teaspoons ) will be drawn every day to check for side effects , for routine tests , to check your blood counts , kidney and liver function , and to check for infections . As part of standard care , you will remain in the hospital for about 3-4 weeks after the transplant . After you are sent home from the hospital , you must remain in the Houston area to be checked for infections and other transplant side effects until about 3 months after transplant . During this time , you will return to the clinic at least 1 time each week . The following tests and procedures will be performed : You will be asked about how you are feeling and about any side effects you may be having . Blood ( about 2 teaspoons ) will be drawn for routine tests . About 1 , 3 , 6 , and 12 months after the transplant : You will have a physical exam , including measurement of your vital signs ( blood pressure , heart rate , temperature , and breathing rate ) . You will be asked about how you are feeling and about any side effects you may be having . Blood ( about 5 teaspoons ) will be drawn to see how well the transplant has `` taken . '' You will have a bone marrow aspiration to check the status of the disease , if your doctor thinks it is needed . To collect a bone marrow aspiration , an area of the hip or other site is numbed with anesthetic , and a small amount of bone marrow is withdrawn through a large needle . Length of Study : You will be taken off study 3 years after the end of treatment . You may be taken off study early if the disease gets worse , if you have any intolerable side effects , of if you are unable to follow study directions . You should talk to the study doctor if you want to leave the study early . If you are taken off study early , you still may need to return for routine follow-up visits after the transplant , if your transplant doctor decides it is needed . It may be life-threatening to leave the study after you have begun to receive the study drugs but before you receive the stem cells . This is an investigational study . Busulfan and fludarabine are both FDA approved and commercially available . The investigational part of this study is the addition of 2 more doses of busulfan . Up to 200 patients will take part in this study .

Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center,NCT01570348,Crohn's Allogeneic Transplant Study,Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center,2,0,Crohn Disease,Procedure,Allogeneic Bone Marrow Transplantation,Treatment,,"This phase II trial studies how well giving a donor bone marrow transplant ( BMT ) works in treating patients with refractory Crohn 's Disease . We will select patients with severe Crohn 's Disease and active inflammation despite the best medical and surgical treatments . These patients must be healthy enough to undergo a transplantation procedure . They can not have an active infection , and their heart , lungs , kidneys , and liver can not be failing . The transplant procedure starts with chemotherapy and a small dose of radiation , to weaken a patient 's immune system so that it will accept bone marrow cells from another person . After that other person 's bone marrow cells are given to the patient , immune suppressive medicines are given to prevent the new cells from being rejected and to stop those cells from damaging the patient . After the new donor cells start to work , blood counts will rise and the new immune system will start to grow . During this time , there is a risk of infection . Antibiotics and anti-viral drugs will be given to prevent infection . When the new donor cells are well-established , immune suppressive medicines are discontinued . We will examine parts of the intestine that were inflamed before the start of the transplant procedure , to be sure the Crohn 's Disease has disappeared after the transplant . Patients will be formally evaluated for Crohn 's activity at around 100 days after transplant , and yearly after that for 5 years .","BACKGROUND : There is strong evidence for genetic susceptibility to Crohn 's Disease ( CD ) , with environmental factors interacting with genetic polymorphisms . Some patients remain refractory to the best available therapies . In patients with intestinal inflammation related to other genetic disorders , allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation has led to disappearance of inflammation , for example , in patients with IPEX ( immune dysregulation , polyendocrinopathy , enteropathy , X-linked ) and with a mutation in the Interleukin-10 receptor , characterized by a severe , early onset , fistulating colitis for which transplantation is the only therapy that offers benefit . Eleven patients with typical CD who achieved allogeneic donor chimerism after transplant had resolution of signs and symptoms of CD that was sustained for up to 15 years . These case series suggest that allogeneic transplantation has substantial potential to cure CD . HYPOTHESIS AND SPECIFIC AIMS : The hypothesis is : Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation ( HCT ) can achieve sustained remissions in patients with refractory CD , and can be done safely . The specific aims are : 1 ) To evaluate the safety and efficacy of allogeneic HCT as treatment for refractory CD . 2 ) To evaluate treatment effect on CD activity/severity using the Crohn 's Disease Activity Index ( CDAI ) and the Simple Endoscopic Score for CD ( SES-CD ) . 3 ) To evaluate safety by scoring regimen-related toxicities , time to engraftment , infectious complications , acute and chronic Graft-versus-Host Disease ( GVHD ) , and treatment-related mortality . 4 ) To evaluate the effect on quality of life . METHODS : This study is a prospective single-arm Phase II clinical trial that will enroll 12 patients . PATIENT SELECTION : Patients will have documented CD ( see eligibility criteria below ) ; signs and symptoms that have failed to respond satisfactorily to medical and surgical therapies ; active intestinal inflammation by endoscopy and histology , and CDAI > = 250 or need for total parenteral nutrition or recurrent inflammation after resection . Donors will be a Human Leukocyte Antigen ( HLA ) -matched sibling or unrelated donor . ALLOGENEIC TRANSPLANT PROCEDURE : Patients will receive a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen of cyclophosphamide , fludarabine and low-dose Total Body Irradiation ( TBI ) , a regimen that has been used successfully in patients receiving haploidentical allografts . Marrow will be used as the graft source to reduce the risk of GVHD . GVHD prophylaxis will consist of post-transplant high-dose cyclophosphamide followed by the combination of tacrolimus and enteric coated mycophenolic acid . Supportive care includes the use of N-acetyl cysteine infusions to reduce the risk of sinusoidal liver injury from cyclophosphamide ; prophylaxis with ursodiol to prevent cholestatic liver disease ; and antimicrobial drugs as prophylaxis and preemptive treatment for infections by bacteria , fungi , herpes viruses , and Pneumocystis jiroveci . Tissue and blood samples will be archived for future studies and evaluation of immune reconstitution at predefined intervals . EFFICACY AND SAFETY ENDPOINTS : Safety and efficacy will be based on clinical assessments , laboratory testing , and gastrointestinal endoscopy and histology at baseline , at day 100 post-transplant , and yearly for 5 years . The primary endpoint is event-free survival at 1 year , defined as alive and free of active CD by endoscopy and biopsy . Transplant-related mortality is death occurring at any time after start of allogeneic HCT . Disease activity will be evaluated using CDAI . Quality of Life will be measured using the Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire . RISKS AND POTENTIAL BENEFITS : The major risks include regimen-related toxicity , infections , graft rejection , and GVHD . Autologous stem cells will be reserved in case of graft rejection . Recent advances in transplant technique have substantially reduced the mortality risk .

Wolfson Medical Center,NCT01802593,Comparison of 2 Immunomodulator Withdrawal Schemes for Infliximab Monotherapy in Active Pediatric Crohn's Disease After Thiopurine Failure,Prof. Arie Levine,4,0,Crohn's Disease,Drug,AZATHIOPRINE or METHOTREXATE,Treatment,,"The goal of the present study is to evaluate the best regimen for infliximab monotherapy , and to evaluate if limited combination therapy with IFX and an Immunomodulator for the first 6 months of therapy , in prior Immunomodulator failures , is superior to monotherapy with Immunomodulator cessation from the second infusion , in preventing loss of remission to IFX .","Background : Current data from studies and registries involving pediatric Crohn 's disease indicate that 50-80 % of children will receive an immunomodulator ( IMM ) as a maintenance therapy within 12 months of diagnosis , and between 60-80 % by 18 months . The common use of IMM early in the disease also leads to a high proportion of patients with active disease despite IMM ( IMMfailure ) . Infliximab has become a standard of care in North America , Europe and Israel , and is recommended at present for steroid dependent or refractory patients , fistulizing disease , active disease despite an immunomodulator . Infliximab was originally prescribed as an add on therapy to IMM , because of concerns regarding IFX side effects and loss of response due to development of antibodies to infliximab ( ATIs ) . An early study clearly showed an advantage in long term remission with thiopurine co administration.However , subsequent studies in adults with CD showed that with scheduled IFX treatment , AZA could be safely discontinued after the first 6 months of therapy , lowering the risks associated with dual immunosuppressive therapies , and the risks of co-therapy . Monotherapy subsequently became the recommended method of treatment with IFX , despite a decrease in trough levels among those who discontinued IMM . IFX mono-therapy became the method of choice for treatment in pediatric CD , though this strategy has been called into question due to frequent loss of response to IFX requiring dose escalation of IFX or decreased intervals of IFX . This loss of response has been attributed to development of ATIs and low trough levels of IFX , which can develop after the first infusions . Low trough levels of infliximab at 14 weeks were predictive of LOR . The second reason for questioning IFX mono-therapy is a trial that compared mono-therapy to combined AZA+IFX therapy in adults with moderate to severe thiopurine naïve disease . This study clearly showed improved long term remission rates and mucosal healing in an unselected cohort of patients with combination therapy . Conversely , mono-therapy was associated with low levels of sustained mucosal healing , which is troublesome . Lastly , some excellent results obtained in a pediatric cohort treated with combined therapy , along with the relatively low risk of HTSCL , has left pediatric gastroenterologists at a loss ; Should we recommend primary mono-therapy , or use IMM for a limited period of time before discontinuing therapy ? When should the IMM be discontinued , after the first infusion or after several months ? There are no controlled data in pediatric IBD to answer this pressing question . There is also a movement towards increased use of methotrexate instead of thiopurines as immunomodulators because of concerns about neoplasia . Recent studies have shown that by adding an immunomodulator to a biologic after LOR , trough levels can be improved and ATIs or ADAs decreased , suggesting that IMM may inhibit antibody formation . The investigators hypothesize that by continuing IMM with IFX for the first 6 months , the investigators will detect a benefit . The investigators hypothesize that early cessation of an IMM will increase the risk of LOR ( Loss of response ) , decrease trough levels at 14 weeks , and be associated with lower rates of corticosteroid free sustained remission by one year . In a parallel study , using the same data base , We also hypothesize that low trough levels at week 14 ( parallel study ) will predict LOR- This study , called Predict Study ; Prediction of Loss of Response to Infliximab in Crohn 's Disease Based on Week 14 Trough Levels.will enable open label enrolment of patients receiving infliximab with an immunomodulator , but will not require randomization , and patients may be allocated to group one or group 2 at the physicians or patients discretion . Methods : It is a prospective open label phase 4 RCT in pediatric patients with active CD , defined by the Porto criteria , despite > 10 weeks of prior treatment with an immunomodulator ( thiopurines/Methotrexate ) , requiring infliximab , involving 2 arms , and intention to treat analysis after the first infusion .",2012-12-24,"December 21, 2015","Inclusion Criteria : Crohns disease Age : 6 - 18 years ( inclusive ) Active disease PCDAI > 10 , or any steroid dependence despite thiopurine use for > 10 weeks .

Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center,NCT01662895,High-Dose Deferoxamine in Intracerebral Hemorrhage,Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center,2,0,Intracerebral Hemorrhage,Drug,Deferoxamine,Treatment,Quadruple,The main purpose of this study is to determine whether treatment with deferoxamine mesylate is of sufficient promise to improve outcome before pursuing a larger clinical trial to examine its effectiveness as a treatment for brain hemorrhage .,"Several studies show that hemoglobin breakdown and subsequent iron accumulation in the brain play a role in mediating secondary neuronal injury after intracerebral hemorrhage ( ICH ) ; and that treatment with the iron chelator , deferoxamine ( DFO ) , provides neuroprotection in animal models of ICH . The investigators recently concluded a phase-I , safety and dose-finding study of DFO in patients with ICH ; repeated daily intravenous ( IV ) infusions of DFO in doses up to 62 mg/kg/day ( up to a maximum daily dose of 6000 mg/day ) were well-tolerated and did not increase serious adverse events or mortality . The current study builds on these results to assess the potential utility of DFO as a therapeutic intervention in ICH . This is a prospective , multi-center , double-blind , randomized , placebo-armed , phase-II , futility clinical study to determine if this maximum tolerated dose of DFO is of sufficient promise to improve outcome prior to embarking on a large-scale and costly phase III study to assess its efficacy in ICH . The investigators will randomize 324 subjects with ICH equally ( 1:1 ) to either DFO at 62 mg/kg/day ( up to a maximum daily dose of 6000 mg/day ) , or saline placebo , given by continuous IV infusion for 5 consecutive days . Treatment will be initiated within 24 hours after ICH symptom onset . Subjects will be stratified based on baseline ICH score ( 0-2 vs. 3-5 ) and ICH onset-to-treatment time ( OTT ) window ( ≤12h vs. > 12-24h ) , so that the resulting randomization ratio is 1:1 within each ICH score and OTT window strata . The main objectives are : To assess whether it would be futile to move DFO forward into a Phase III trial based on the end point of good outcome ( defined as dichotomized modified Rankin Scale score of 0-2 at 3 months ) . At the conclusion of the study , the proportion of DFO-treated subjects with a good outcome will be compared to the placebo proportion in a futility analysis . If the DFO-treated proportion is less than 12 % greater than the placebo proportion , then it would be futile to move DFO forward to future Phase III testing . To collect more data on treatment-related adverse events in order to ascertain that patients with ICH can tolerate this dose given over an extended 5-day duration of infusion without experiencing unreasonable neurological complications , increased mortality , or other serious adverse events related to DFO use . Secondary and exploratory objectives include : 1- Determining the overall distribution of scores on mRS at 3 months in DFO-treated subjects , and to perform a dichotomized analysis considering the proportion of DFO- and placebo-treated subjects with mRS 0-3 . Successful completion of this study will provide a crucial `` go/no-go '' signal for DFO in ICH . Futility will discourage a major phase III trial , whereas non-futility will offer strong support for a phase III study to detect clinical efficacy . Results from this study can provide valuable information to guide the design and sample size estimation of a potential future Phase III trial . ICH is a frequent cause of disability and death . A successful study demonstrating the efficacy of DFO would be of considerable public health significance . Update : Enrollment into the trial was terminated by the Data and Safety Monitoring Board because of an imbalance in subjects with reported ARDS . At the time of termination , 42 subjects had been enrolled . As a result , any formal evaluation of these objectives would be under-powered , but descriptive statistics are provided .

Rituximab is an intravenous medication that specifically attacks a protein commonly found on lymphoma cells called CD20 . Rituximab is already widely used to treat multiple forms of lymphoma . Moreover , continuing rituximab after the completion of chemotherapy is already commonly used to help patients stay in remission longer . Everolimus has been shown in many types of relapsed lymphoma to decrease the size of lymph nodes by itself . Everolimus is approved by the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) for the treatment of advanced kidney cancer and subependymal giant cell astocytoma . It is not approved for use in lymphoma . The use of everolimus in this research study is investigational . The word `` investigational '' means that everolimus is not approved for marketing by the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) .

University of Miami,NCT01669421,Effect of Double Dose of Alpha 1-antitrypsin Augmentation Therapy on Lung Inflammation.,"Michael Campos, MD",2,1,Alpha 1 Antitrypsin Deficiency,Drug,Alpha-1 Antitrypsin (human),Treatment,,"The current treatment of individuals with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency ( AATD ) who develop lung disease ( COPD ) is the administration of intravenous purified alpha-1 antitrypsin ( augmentation therapy ) at a fixed dose of 60 mg/kg per week . This dose aims at increasing the deficient AAT serum levels just above a predetermined `` safety threshold '' of 11 uM . However , normal levels of AAT are between 25-50 uM . AAT has shown not only to inhibit lung proteases such as neutrophil elastase , but also to modulate inflammation . Given that many subjects with AATD who receive augmentation therapy still have significant lung disease and inflammation , this study will evaluate whether doubling the dose to 120 mg/kg/week has an effect in decreasing lung inflammation . Only the dosing of 60 mg/kg /week has received FDA approval . FDA has granted an IND number to this study to test the higher dose of 120 mg/kg/week . The study will evaluate systemic ( serum ) and pulmonary ( bronchoscopy samples ) markers of inflammation in 3 phases : standard dose ( 4 weeks ) , double dose ( 4 weeks ) and standard dose ( 4 weeks ) .","This is a pilot study to test the effect of double dose augmentation therapy with Zemaira ( CSL Behring ) on lung inflammation , compared with standard doses of 60 mg/kg/week . Our hypothesis is that some patients with AATD receiving augmentation therapy at the standard dose of 60 mg/kg/week continue to have a significant lung inflammation that may lead to detrimental clinical consequences . This inflammation can be further reduced with higher AAT dosing . The study will enroll 20 subjects with AATD and COPD already receiving augmentation therapy with any brand at standard doses for at least a month . For inclusion and exclusion criteria see below . Protocol : The study will take place over approximately 12 weeks : a month receiving Zemaira at standard dose ( 60 mg/kg/week ) , a month at double dose ( 120 mg/kg/week ) and a month at standard dose ( 60 mg/kg/week ) . The infusions at standard doses will be done at home and infusions with higher doses will be provided at the study site . the study involves scheduled blood draws for clinical labs and serum for research samples . At the end of each phase a bronchoscopy will be performed ( 3 in total ) to obtain research samples ( lung lavage , brushings and endobronchial biopsies ) . The first bronchoscopy after receiving 4 weeks of standard augmentation therapy will assess the `` residual '' inflammation that may be present despite augmentation therapy . The second bronchoscopy after double dose augmentation therapy phase will be to assess changes ( decreases ) in inflammatory markers . The third bronchoscopy after resuming standard dosing is to assess if inflammation returned to baseline levels ( required for proof of concept ) . There will be approximately 9 visits to the study clinic . This study does not include placebo ( no active drug ) treatment . Besides blood draws and bronchoscopy , the study will include questionnaires and lung function testing .",2012-08-14,"April 17, 2019","Inclusion Criteria : Males or Females aged between 18 and 75 years .

Both animal and human research indicate that aerosolized salt water might help reduce harmful inflammation with minimal risks .,"Despite over 40 years of investigation , acute lung injury ( ALI ) remains a leading cause of morbidity in critically ill patients , and a disease for which there is no effective pharmacologic therapy . Our group and others have focused on the anti-inflammatory effects of intravenous hypertonic saline ( HTS ) acting on the injured endothelium with promising results experimentally , but failed to confirm the benefit clinically . Recent work , however , has shown that inhaled or nebulized HTS targeted at the epithelium is safe and effective in treating cystic fibrosis , COPD , and neonatal bronchiolitis . Recognizing the central role of the pulmonary epithelium in ALI , nebulization has the advantage of achieving high concentrations of the therapy without producing systemic side effects .

Vanderbilt University Medical Center,NCT01661764,"Fish Oil Supplementation, Nutrigenomics and Colorectal Cancer Prevention",Vanderbilt University,2,1,Colorectal Adenomatous Polyps,Drug,Eicosapentanoic acid and docosahexanoic acid,Prevention,Quadruple,"Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related death within the United States . Animal models and observational studies have suggested that marine-derived n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids [ PUFA ] such as eicosapentanoic acid [ EPA ] and docosahexanoic acid [ DHA ] may reduce the risk of colorectal cancer . In addition , it may be the relative proportion of n-3 to n-6 PUFAs that best determines the chemopreventive effects of fish oils . This ratio is important because the n-6 PUFA , arachidonic acid ( ARA ) , is converted via the cyclo-oxygenase ( COX ) pathway to prostaglandin E2 ( PGE2 ) , an inflammatory eicosanoid overproduced in colorectal neoplasms while EPA is converted to the anti-inflammatory prostaglandin E3 ( PGE3 ) . While the ratio of n-6 to n-3 PUFAs can be altered through dietary changes , genetic factors may also influence this ratio . Recent genetic studies have demonstrated that much of the tissue levels of ARA is determined by differences in a gene called fatty acid desaturase 1 ( FADS1 ) . FADS1 is the rate-limiting enzyme in the conversion of linoleic acid , the most commonly consumed PUFA in the Western diet , to ARA , and one particular genetic variant caller rs174537 is associated with lower fatty acid desaturase activity and subsequently lower tissue levels of ARA . The study hypothesis is that individuals with genetically determined lower activity of FADS1 will derive greater benefit from fish oil supplementation than individuals with higher FADS1 activity because of lower tissue levels of ARA and subsequently a more favorable n-6 to n-3 PUFA ratio . To test this hypothesis the investigators will recruit 150 participants with recently identified adenomatous polyps and conduct a 6-month double blind 3 X 2 factorial randomized controlled trial . The first factor will be FADS1 genotype ( GG , GT , and TT ) and the second factor will be fish oil supplementation ( fish oil versus placebo ) . The primary outcome will be the change in rectal epithelial cell growth and cell death . Secondary outcomes will include rectal epithelial cell expression of genes important in PGE2 production , rectal cell production of PGE2 and PGE3 , rectal mucosal tissue levels of fatty acids , and changes in biomarkers of inflammation ( C-reactive protein ) , adipokines ( leptin , adiponectin ) , and markers of insulin sensitivity . The specific aims include : 1 ) to determine the efficacy of fish oil supplements on rectal epithelial cell proliferation indexes and markers of rectal crypt apoptosis , and 2 ) to determine the effect of genetically-determined fatty acid desaturase 1 activity on fish oil supplementation for colorectal cancer chemoprevention . The investigators long-term objectives are to determine genetic factors that might influence the efficacy of fish oil supplementation in order to conduct a more definitive adenoma recurrence trial using marine-derived n-3 PUFAs . The investigators anticipate that fish oil will have anti-neoplastic effect and individuals with low FADS1 activity will have a greater response compared to individuals with high FADS1 activity","1.Rationale and Specific Aims Colorectal cancer ( CRC ) is the third most common cancer and the second most frequent cause of cancer related mortality in the United States . Animal and human studies have suggested that the marine-derived n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids ( PUFAs ) , eicosapentanoic acid ( EPA ) and docosahexanoic acid ( DHA ) , have cancer inhibitory properties while conversely , n-6 PUFAs such as arachidonic acid ( ARA ) may promote tumorigenesis . The mechanism behind these opposing effects is likely due to differences in the biological activity of their eicosanoids end products and their effects on chronic inflammation . Prostaglandin E2 ( PGE2 ) is a pro-inflammatory eicosanoid that is aberrantly produced in both colorectal adenomas and cancer and is derived from ARA via the cyclo-oxygenase pathway . EPA is converted through the same pathway into prostaglandin E3 , which has 4 to 7- fold less prostaglandin E receptor affinity , is less inflammatory , and may even be pro-apoptotic compared to PGE2 . As such , it may be the ratio of ARA to EPA and DHA rather than the absolute levels of marine-derived n-3 PUFAs that contribute most towards their antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic effects . The ratio of ARA to EPA + DHA can be manipulated through fish oil supplementation , however ; genetic factors may play a key role on determining this ratio . Recent genome-wide association and haplotype studies have demonstrated that up to 28 % of the additive variance in tissue levels of ARA is explained by variants in a single gene , fatty acid desaturase 1 ( FADS1 ) . FADS1 is the rate-limiting enzyme in the conversion of linoleic acid ( LA ) , the most commonly consumed PUFA , to ARA , and homozygotes for the T allele ( population frequency of 13 % , HapMap -CEU ) in rs174537 have lower fatty acid desaturase activity and subsequently lower tissue levels of ARA . While EPA can be produced in vivo from α-linolenic acid , in humans , this process is extremely inefficient and most tissue level EPA derives directly from dietary consumption of fatty fish . Thus , high activity of FAD1 and subsequently increased tissue levels of ARA may offset some of the potential benefits of dietary supplementation with fish oil . To date , no previously published studies have investigated how genetic variants that influence fatty acid desaturase activity might modify the beneficial effects of fish oil supplementation . The investigators hypothesis is that the individuals with genetically determined lower activity of FADS1 will derive greater benefit from fish oil supplementation than individuals with higher FADS1 activity because of lower tissue levels of ARA and subsequently a more favorable ARA to EPA + DHA ratio . To test this hypothesis the investigators will recruit 150 participants with recently identified adenomatous polyps and conduct a 6-month double blind 3 X 2 factorial randomized controlled trial . The first factor will be the rs174537 genotype ( GG , GT , and TT ) in the FADS1 gene and the second factor will be fish oil supplementation ( fish oil versus placebo ) . The primary study outcome will be the change from baseline in rectal epithelial cell proliferation as measured by Ki-67 labeling and rectal crypt apoptosis as measured by TUNEL . Secondary endpoints will include rectal epithelial cell expression of COX-2 and 15-PGDH , rectal cell production of PGE2 and PGE3 , rectal cell fatty acid concentrations , as well as , changes from baseline in biomarkers of inflammation ( C-reactive protein ) , adipokines ( leptin , adiponectin ) , and markers of insulin sensitivity ( HOMA-IR ) . The Specific Aims for this research proposal are : to determine the efficacy of fish oil supplements on rectal epithelial cell proliferation indexes and markers of rectal crypt apoptosis ; and , to determine the effect of genetically determined fatty acid desaturase activity on fish oil supplementation for markers of colorectal cancer risk . The investigators long-term objectives are to determine genetic factors that might influence the efficacy of fish oil supplementation in order to conduct a more definitive adenoma recurrence trial using marine-derived n-3 PUFAs . The investigators anticipate that fish oil will have anti-neoplastic effect and individuals with low FADS1 activity will have a greater response compared to individuals with high FADS1 activity . This study will be the first to investigate the nutrigenomics of fish oil supplementation in colorectal cancer chemoprevention and may have implications beyond cancer prevention as fish oil is being actively investigated for its anti-inflammatory effects in cardiovascular and psychiatric diseases as well as diabetes mellitus and the metabolic syndrome . 2 . Recruitment and Retention The investigators will identify eligible participants based on the inclusion criteria by reviewing study data and medical record data collected in the Tennessee Colorectal Polyp Study ( TCPS ) . Participants still eligible after record review will be mailed an introductory letter inviting them to participate . One week after the letter is mailed ; a trained interviewer from the Vanderbilt Survey Research Shared Resource ( SRSR ) will call the potential participants to provide more detailed information about the study , answer questions about the study , and to see if they may be interested in participating . At that time , an appointment will be made with the participant for the baseline in-person visit . After the initial visit and informed consent is obtained an interviewer from the SRSR will conduct the baseline interview survey and 24-hour dietary recalls . At the baseline visit , the investigators will re-genotype rs174535 to confirm the accuracy of the imputation process . This strategy will allow the investigators to efficiently and accurately identify appropriate candidates for our study . Eligible subjects will present to the Vanderbilt General Clinical Research Center ( GCRC ) for the initial visit and baseline study procedures . Participants who are eligible for the study and provide written consent for enrollment will have blood obtained ; an adipose tissue biopsy performed , and undergoes the baseline rectal mucosal biopsy procedure . Treatment assignment will be obtained from the Vanderbilt Investigational Pharmacy by a coordinator . The first dose of the study medication will be given to patients at the initial visit and the date and time recorded . This date and time will be considered the time of randomization . 3 . Randomization Randomization will be performed according to a permuted block randomization scheme stratified on the three genotypes . Randomization will proceed within these three strata with a block size of balancing interval , varying randomly according to the outcome of a computer generated random number . This ensures that the cumulative proportion of assignments to each treatment will be balanced after each block of assignments has been made . 4 . Study Procedures Data Collection Because outside dietary exposure to both n-6 and n-3 PUFAs could possibly confound the effect of fish oil supplementation the investigators will perform a total of four 24-hour dietary recall studies for each participant over the course of the study . At enrollment , the investigators will conduct two 24-hour dietary assessments , one on the weekday and one on the weekend , as participants ' diet may differ based on the day of the week . In addition the investigators will conduct one 24-hour dietary recall at week 8 and at week 16 . The investigators will use data collected from these 24-hour dietary assessments along with standard food composition tables to calculate dietary exposure to PUFAs . The investigators will determine adherence to study drug at each in-person visit during the study . Medication and medication changes will be recorded at these visits . Patients who initiate a new NSAID during the study will be withdrawn and an exit visit performed . Adherence to fish oil will also be determined through RBC phospholipid membrane fatty acid analysis performed at month 3 and month 6 . In addition , to determine whether fish oil supplementation also influences fatty acid membrane concentration at the target tissue , the investigators will determine the change in rectal epithelial cell phospholipid membrane fatty acid concentration . Fish oil Capsules Participants allocated to fish oil supplementation will be instructed to take three Lovaza® capsules each containing 465 mg of EPA and 375 mg DHA daily ; this will provide a total daily dose of 1395 mg EPA plus 1125 mg DHA for a total daily dose of fish oil of 2.5 grams . Patients will take one tablet three times a day with meals . Lovaza® capsules are the only FDA approved preparation of fish oil , and as such , the quality of the drug is monitored and assured . Pharmacological grade fish oil capsules have the advantage of providing high concentrations of PUFAs , low levels of contaminants , such as mercury , and almost no fish odor . Placebo Capsules The investigators will use oleic acid as a placebo . The reason for the use of oleic acid is several-fold . First , oleic acid ( olive oil ) capsules have a similar texture , size , color , and consistency to fish oil capsules . More importantly , oleic acid does not undergo conversion to an eicosanoid or any other metabolically active product . This is opposed to corn oil , which has also been used as a placebo in fish oil studies but is primarily linoleic acid and could subsequently increase tissue levels of ARA and confound the results of our study . Oleic acid has been used as a placebo in several prior studies of fish oil supplementation and is well tolerated . Assessment Visits Patients will attend the GCRC clinic at the baseline ( initial visit ) , after 3 months of study treatment ( mid-point visit ) , and after 6 months of study treatment ( end visit ) . The study coordinator will contact participants every 4 weeks over the course of the study to encourage adherence to the study protocol . At the 3-month and 6-month visits , compliance with treatment will be monitored by capsule count and measurement of RBC phospholipid fatty acid concentrations . Adverse events will be recorded at these visits . 5 . Data management and quality control The Vanderbilt GCRC Informatics Core will be used as a central location for data processing and analysis . Vanderbilt University has developed software tools and workflow methodology for electronic collection and management of research study data . ( 132 ) REDCap ( Research Electronic Data Capture ) is a secure , web-based application that provides an intuitive interface for users to enter validated data remotely ( with automated data type and range checks ) , data manipulation audit trails and reporting , and an export mechanism for end-of-study export of data to common statistical packages .",2012-08-07,"May 11, 2018",Inclusion Criteria : ≥ 40 and < 80 years of age History of 1 or more adenomatous polyps Consent to be contacted for future studies Participants with known genotype for rs174535 in FADS1 Prior participation in the Tennessee Colorectal Polyp Study or the Personalized Prevention of Colorectal Cancer Trial Exclusion Criteria : Previously resected colorectal cancer Coronary artery disease or congestive heart failure Current metabolic or life-threatening disease Currently taking fish oil supplements Inability or unwillingness to stop NSAIDs or ASA during the study Allergic to fish products Diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease Diagnosis of any cancer ( except non-melanoma skin cancer ) Diagnosis of liver or kidney disease Pregnant or breast feeding,141,0,40 Years,79 Years

It prevents degradation of fibrin and delays the breakdown of hemostatic clots . It has been demonstrated in multiple studies and meta analyses to decrease blood loss in elective hip and knee arthroplasty . However , concerns about the prothrombotic side effects of systemic administration of TA has hindered the widespread adoption of this medication in orthopaedic patients due to their high risk for thrombotic complications such as deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism Topical application of tranexamic acid has been proposed as a way to mitigate the potential prothrombotic effects of TA . Topical application of TA has been demonstrated to be beneficial in oral and cardiac surgery . Plasma levels of TA have been found to be minimal following topical application , minimizing its potential systemic thromboembolic side effects . TA has been used topically in total knee arthroplasty , with significant reductions in blood loss and no increase in thromboembolic complications8,10 .

University of Mississippi Medical Center,NCT01722994,A Comparison of Polyglactin 910 and Chromic Gut Suture in the Closure of Punch Biopsy Sites,University of Mississippi Medical Center,4,1,Wound Closure Technique,Device,Polyglactin 910 sterile synthetic absorbable suture (Ethicon),Treatment,,"Some Dermatologists prefer absorbable suture to non-absorbable suture in the closure of punch biopsy sites . The reason these are often preferred is because patients do not have to pay for another visit to get the suture material removed . Also patients are not inconvenienced into returning to the office for suture removal1 . However , the absorbable suture material currently used by most Dermatologists is very expensive . In order to evaluate ways to reduce costs for patients , we will compare a less expensive suture material ( chromic gut ) with one of the absorbable suture materials currently used in clinical practice ( PDS ) . Patients who are eligible and choose to participate in the study will undergo a punch biopsy and a suture will be used to close the skin . The type of suture received by the patient will be randomized , like the flip of a coin . Group A will receive PDS and Group B will receive chromic gut suture . After one weeks time , the patient will return to clinic and their dermatologist will evaluate the biopsy site for redness , wound infection , wound opening , and scar formation . The patients will be given a questionnaire evaluating their satisfaction with the cosmetic outcome and any pain caused by the suture materials . If the suture came out before the visit , the patient will be asked to report on what day the suture fell out . The patients will return two more times over the next two weeks to receive the same questionnaire and evaluation by their dermatologist .","Purpose of the Study This study will seek to compare two absorbable suture materials ( PDS and chromic gut ) in the closure of punch biopsy sites . This information could contribute to cost savings and increased convenience for patients . Background A punch biopsy is a full thickness skin biopsy performed by Dermatologists to diagnose various skin conditions . The incision from the biopsy ranges from 2 - 6mm in width2 . There have been several recommendations of ways to manage these biopsy sites including the use of a non-absorbable suture such as nylon , healing by second intention and the use of an absorbable suture such as PDS or Polyglactin 9101,3 . The benefit of an absorbable suture over a non-absorbable suture is reduced costs to the patient because they will not have pay for a suture removal visit . Also , the patients do not have the extra inconvenience of returning to the clinic a second time2,3 . There has been only one case in the literature comparing an absorbable with a non-absorbable suture material in the closure of skin punch biopsy sites2 . Never , has there been a study comparing two different absorbable suture in this setting . We believe there may be a less expensive suture material that would yield the same performance as the current ones . If this is the case , this information could benefit the Dermatology community in that it would provide a less expensive alternative suture material to close skin punch biopsy sites . Therefore , it would cut overall costs related to this routine procedure . Chromic gut is an absorbable suture made from natural fibers of sheep or cattle intestine . It is one of the first absorbable sutures available and is inexpensive . The difference between plain gut and chromic gut is chromic gut is treated with chromic salts which allows it to retain its tensile strength longer . The suture integrity lasts 10-14 days ( time at when the suture begins the absorption process ) with complete absorption in 15-60 days . Chromic gut is documented to have moderate to high tissue reactivity4,5 . PDS is an absorbable , monofilament made from synthetic material ( polyester ) . It is a newer , more expensive , absorbable suture material . The suture integrity lasts 45-60 days with total absorption in 180 days . PDS is documented to have low tissue reactivity and is shown to maintain its tensile strength in the presence of a bacterial infection4,5 . Performance of PDS with chromic gut suture in closing of punch biopsy sites would be compared in this study . We hope that the information that we collect could show that the less expensive suture ( chromic gut ) can be safely used in closing skin punch biopsy sites , therefore improving the clinical practice of these procedures and saving the health care system money . Number of Subjects Up to 100 subjects are anticipated in this project . Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria Inclusion Criteria In order for patients to participate in this study , they must : Be age 18 or older Having a punch biopsy procedure performed for benign reasons Biopsy site is between the shoulders and ankles Exclusion Criteria Patients may not participate in this study if they : Having a punch biopsy procedure performed for a suspicious cancerous lesion including basal and squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma Biopsy site is on the face , palms , soles or groin area Vulnerable Subjects Elderly subjects will be included in this study . However , these subjects will not be coerced in any way to participate . As with all other subjects , the investigator will explain the purpose of the research and the nature and duration of the procedures to elderly subjects . The investigator will then explain the risk of a breach of confidentiality , the possible societal benefits associated with the study , and the right of subjects to withdraw consent at any time without penalty . The investigator will ask the subject to confirm that they fully understand all of these issues , and subjects will be asked if they have any questions about the research . Before data collection can occur , the subject 's questions concerning the study must be answered to his or her satisfaction . Method of Subject Identification and Recruitment Patients age 18 and over who meet the study 's inclusion criteria will be asked during their office visit of their willingness to participate in a study that compares two absorbable suture materials ( PDS and chromic gut ) in the closure of punch biopsy sites . Patients who choose to participate must sign a consent form after the study protocol has been explained and is fully understood . The dermatologist will perform a punch biopsy and will close the skin with either the PDS or chromic gut suture . The patients will be randomized into either Group A that will receive PDS suture or Group B that will receive chromic gut suture . A nurse will place patients into groups A and B based on whether they are an even or an odd patient . Methods and Procedures Applied to Human Subjects During their office visit , patients over the age of 18 who meet the inclusion criteria and do not meet the exclusion criteria will be invited to participate in the study . Patients who choose to participate will be given a verbal explanation of the study protocol by an investigator . A punch biopsy will be performed and each site will be closed with one simple percutaneous suture using a P-3 needle and aseptic technique . The type of suture received by the patient will be randomized . Group A will receive PDS suture and Group B will receive chromic gut suture . The wounds will be dressed with bacitracin and an adhesive bandage . The sites will be treated with twice daily bacitracin and bandage changes by the patient . After one weeks time , the patient will return to clinic and their dermatologist will evaluate the biopsy site for redness , wound infection , wound dehiscence , and scar hypertrophy . The patients will be given a questionnaire evaluating their satisfaction with the cosmetic outcome and any pain caused by the suture . If the suture came out before the visit , the patient will be asked to report on what day the suture fell out . The patients will return in one week and the same evaluation will be performed by their Dermatologist as well as given the same questionnaire . Lastly , the patients will return for their fourth total visit to once again be given the same evaluation by their Dermatologist as well as given the same questionnaire . Setting and Mode of Administering Suture Materials , Evaluation and Questionaire Data collection will take place in the following location : • Face and Skin Center Township at Colony Park 201 Northlake Avenue , Suite 211 Ridgeland , MS 39157 Each participant will be educated on study protocol before data collection begins .

Istituto Clinico Humanitas,NCT01726465,Methylprednisolone N Acetylcysteine in Hepatic Resections,Istituto Clinico Humanitas,2,0,Ischemic Reperfusion Injury,Drug,Methylprednisolone,Treatment,Double,"This is a prospective double-blind randomized phase II clinical trial , with two groups of intervention ( one with administration of N-acetylcysteine and the other with administration of methylprednisolone ) , and one group of placebo . The purpose of this study is to investigate the role of N-acetylcysteine and Methylprednisolone in the modulation of warm ischemia of the liver during hepatic resection . In fact to avoid massive blood loss in liver surgery , continuous or intermittent vascular clamping of the hepatic hilum ( 'Pringle maneuver ' ) is generally used with good results . However , as a consequence , ischemia and subsequent reperfusion result in complex metabolic , immunological , and microvascular changes , which together might contribute to hepatocellular damage and dysfunction . This phenomenon , known as ischemia-reperfusion ( IR ) injury of the liver , is a complex multi-path process leading to the activation of some inflammatory pathways . Any patient candidate to liver resection will be enrolled in the study based on the aforementioned criteria . The primary objective of the study is to assess the real efficacy of Methylprednisolone and N-acetylcysteine in reducing the secondary damage from ischemia reperfusion injury in liver resection and in reducing inflammatory response . Secondary objective of the study is whether the reduction of ischemia-reperfusion injury results in : lower incidence of postoperative liver failure , improvement of postoperative liver function , and reduction of blood components transfusions . The randomization will be done the day before the operation . The drugs will be prepared in a blind fashion by the hospital pharmacy . The hospital pharmacy will provide to each patient a drip to make bolus of about an hour before the start of the liver resection and a syringe pump for an infusion of approximately 6 hours . If the patient is enrolled and randomized in the placebo arm , he/she will receive 250 ml of glucose 5 % plus the infusion of 100 ml of glucose 5 % If the patient is randomized in the Methylprednisolone arm , he/she will receive a dose of 500 mg in 250 ml of glucose 5 % plus 100 mg of glucose 5 % . If the patient is randomized in the N-acetylcysteine arm , he/she will receive a dose of 150 mg/kg in 250 ml of glucose 5 % plus N-acetylcysteine 50 mg/kg in 100 ml glucose 5 % . Systematic sampling of liver function tests will be done the day before the operation , at the end of the operation , as well as in postoperative day 1 , 3 , 5 and 7 .","Elective liver resection is performed mainly for benign and malignant liver tumors . The malignant tumors may arise primarily within the liver ( hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma ) or represent metastases from malignancies of other organs . During hepatic resection , the risk of severe intraoperative bleeding represents a major risk . To avoid massive blood loss , continuous or intermittent vascular clamping of the hepatic artery and portal vein ( 'Pringle maneuver ' ) is an efficient method to reduce hemorrhage . However , as a consequence , ischemia and subsequent reperfusion result in complex metabolic , immunological , and microvascular changes , which together might contribute to hepatocellular damage and dysfunction . This phenomenon , known as ischemia-reperfusion ( IR ) injury of the liver , is a complex multi-path process leading to the activation of inflammatory pathways , in which cellular injury results from events occurring during both the ischemic and reperfusion phases . The key mechanism of tissue injury is the intense and excessive inflammatory response to reperfusion . Although initially considered a condition mediated by innate immune responses , IR injury also triggers adaptive immunity , such as activated Kupffer cells that express cytokines and chemokines thereby leading to further neutrophils activation and recruitment . Neutrophils inflict tissue damage on the liver through the generation of some reactive oxygen-species ( ROS ) and of some proteolytic enzymes . Various methods and many pharmacological agents have been attempted to decrease the IR injury associated with prolonged duration of vascular occlusion , no one is a standard of care in protocols for liver resection . After a tough review of the literature we considered the most promising data on two drugs : N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) and Methylprednisolone ( MET ) . NAC seems more active in ischemic phase and in the early reperfusion period . In fact when blood flow is interrupted cellular adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) is depleted and there is a buildup of adenosine monophosphate , which is catabolized to hypoxanthine that is oxidized to xanthine by the enzyme xanthine oxidase , generating ROS in the process . Glutathione ( GSH ) , that is an antioxidant present in the liver , offers protection against oxygen free radicals . During hypoxia , GSH stores are consumed , which predisposes to oxidative injury . N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) serves as a precursor to GSH and can replenish intracellular GSH stores , it directly scavenge hydrogen peroxide . It has also been shown to impair the chemo taxis and generation of oxygen radicals by human phagocytic cells through an anti-inflammatory action , inhibit cytokine-mediated induction of nitric oxide synthase in human hepatocytes in vitro and have probably an anti-inflammatory mechanism of hepatoprotection against oxidative injury from nitric oxide ( NO ) . So there is a substantial body of experimental work evaluating the role of NAC in liver I/R injury , but these studies are small in terms of patients , and more importantly they utilize a widely disparate range of protocols of administration . Yet , there is only one small study describing the outcome of a randomized controlled trial in patients undergoing liver resection . Thus , we decide , after the ' a priori ' sample power calculation , to investigate the effect of NAC in patients submitted to hepatic resection systematically performed with the 'Pringle maneuver ' using the same loading dose and subsequent infusion of some Randomized Clinical Trial in liver transplantation . Together with NAC we decide to investigate the effects of MET , which is a glucocorticoid steroid that acts as an anti-inflammatory agent , reducing inflammatory markers and apoptotic cell count in experimental liver IR injury . To our knowledge , there are only three published studies that evaluated the role of MET in liver resection , but only one of those was associated to a significant decrease of transaminase enzymes ( AST and ALT ) . The basic hypothesis is that the protective effects of Methylprednisolone may become more apparent as the extent of liver resection and/or the duration of vascular occlusion increases . Therefore , the investigators designed a randomized controlled trial with adequate sample size with the aim to recognize in the intervention groups , one with NAC and one with MET , a statistically significant reduction of ALT and AST ( 100U/L ) compared with the placebo group . No stratifications are planned . Two comparisons are planned Experimental ( MET+NAC ) vs. Standard and MET vs. NAC . A randomization ratio MET : NAC : STD=1:1:1 is planned ; for the Experimental ( EXP ) Vs Standard ( STD ) comparison the allocation ratio is therefore 2:1 . In order to verify the superiority of EXP ( MET+NAC ) it was assumed that with the standard treatment the mean value of ALT was 800 units with a standard deviation ( SD ) of 100 , as reported in literature . the investigators decided to consider of interest a reduction of 100 for the experimental treatments leading to consider a value of 700 as desirable . Considering α value of 0.025 ( one-sided ) and a power of 90 % , a total of 48 evaluable patients are required ( 16 in each arm ) . If the test results in a statistical significant advantage for EXP arms ( MET+NAC ) , the study will continue the accrual for MET and NAC only , with the aim of comparing MET vs. NAC , considering a difference of interest of 50 units , with α value of 0.05 ( two-sided ) and a power of 80 % . Further 94 Pts need to be enrolled for a total of 126 evaluable patients available for the comparison of MET vs. NAC . The total sample size will be 142 ( 63 treated with MET , 63 treated with NAC and 16 treated with standard therapy ) .",2012-11-07,"November 9, 2013","Inclusion Criteria : Any sex , any race , any ethnicity Age > 18 Primary and secondary liver tumors Normal renal function Anticipated Pringle 's length > 30 minutes Exclusion Criteria : Renal failure of any grade ASA 4 Associate major surgery Intraoperative bleeding > 1500 ml Allergy to N-acetylcysteine or Methylprednisolone",50,0,18 Years,70 Years

"University of California, Los Angeles",NCT01737593,Can Acetaminophen Given 1-2 Hours to Children Before Ear Tube Surgery Reduce Agitation After Anesthesia?,"University of California, Los Angeles",4,0,Emergence Agitation,Drug,Acetaminophen,Supportive Care,Double,"Emergence agitation ( EA ) occurs in up to 67 % of pediatric patients after anesthesia for bilateral myringotomy tubes ( BMT , `` ear tubes '' ) . The goal of this study is to find out whether acetaminophen given well before surgery can decrease pain and therefore , decrease emergence agitation better than acetaminophen given shortly before or during surgery . EA can be dangerous for the patient because it may be hard to monitor their vital signs during an important phase of recovery , they may injure themselves , may require the presence of extra staff , and it can be very distressing to the parents . Causes of EA are not well understood , but it can be worsened by pain . 70 % of patients undergoing BMT experience pain that needs treatment . Intranasal fentanyl , a strong analgesic , has been shown to decrease EA , but often ends up in dose-dependent nausea and vomiting . In previous studies and in common practice , acetaminophen is given either 30 minutes before induction of anesthesia or immediately after induction . The peak analgesic effect of acetaminophen is 60-120 minutes . Since the procedure is generally completed in 5-10 minutes , the therapeutic effect of acetaminophen may not be present upon emergence from anesthesia . The purpose of this study is to find out if acetaminophen given 60-120 minutes prior to emergence can decrease EA in patients undergoing BMT . Patients would be randomized to one of three groups : Control will receive acetaminophen rectally while under anesthesia ( standard practice ) , Group 1 will receive acetaminophen 10 mg/kg at 60-120 minutes prior to surgery , Group 2 will receive acetaminophen 20 mg/kg at 60-120 minutes prior to surgery . All groups would also receive a dose of intranasal fentanyl during the surgery , which is standard practice . Patients would be observed in the recovery room at various time points for evidence of EA and pain .","Emergence agitation ( EA ) occurs in up to 67 % of patients undergoing Sevoflurane anesthesia for bilateral myringotomy tube placement ( BMT ) . Often EA presents as inconsolable screaming , crying , thrashing , and kicking , and may require restraints . It can be dangerous for the patient because it may be difficult to monitor their vital signs during a critical phase of recovery ( i.e . unable to detect hypoxemia ) , they may injure themselves as they thrash about , it usually requires the presence of extra staff , and it can be very distressing to the parents . Causes of EA are theoretical , but can be exacerbated by pain . 70 % of patients undergoing BMT have pain requiring treatment . Since BMT is performed without IV placement the options for analgesia are limited to intranasal fentanyl , intramuscular ketorolac , rectal or oral acetaminophen , oral opioids ( i.e . codeine , oxycodone ) . Intranasal Fentanyl has been shown to decrease EA , but results in post operative nausea and vomiting , as with any opioids . Intramuscular ketorolac is costly and can lead to hematomas . In previous studies ( common practice ) , acetaminophen is given either 30 minutes before induction ( PO route ) or immediately after induction ( PR route ) . Since the procedure is generally completed in 5-10 minutes , the therapeutic effect of acetaminophen can not be appreciated . The peak effect ( for analgesia ) of acetaminophen is 60-120 minutes . Our hypothesis : If acetaminophen is given 60-120 minutes prior to emergence , when it reaches therapeutic effect , it can decrease EA in patients undergoing BMT . The importance of mitigating EA not only involves patient safety and satisfaction , but will also impact hospital/surgery center efficiency ( RN staffing and smoother and shorter recovery periods ) . This study will be a randomized controlled trial . Potential subjects will be identified and recruited by study personnel and/or patient 's surgeon . Children scheduled for BMT placement whose parents ' consent to participate will be enrolled in the study . These patients will be consented on the day of surgery . Parents will be informed that whether they enroll their children in the study or not , they will be receiving standard clinical care . Only subjects meeting all inclusion criteria and requirements for continuation in the study will be consented . Patients will be enrolled into one of three study groups . All patients meeting all inclusion criteria and requirements for the study ( see below ) will be identified , consented then computer randomized into either control , group 1 or 2 . Control - acetaminophen PR ( 20-40mg/kg ) after induction of Anesthesia ( acetaminophen is in suppository form and given rectally ) Group 1 - acetaminophen PO ( 10mg/kg ) 60-120min before start of BMT placement ( acetaminophen is in syrup form and given by mouth ) Group 2 - acetaminophen PO ( 20mg/kg ) 60-120min before start of BMT placement ( acetaminophen is in syrup form and given by mouth ) After randomization , treating physicians will be made aware of what treatment group the patient is assigned to . The data collection and behavior/pain assessments will be made by blinded study personnel in the operating room ( only for induction ) and PACU .

The results of this study can provide further information for patient selection and therapeutic duration .,"This study is designed in a randomized , double-blind , placebo controlled , multicentric trial . A total of 60 patients will be enrolled . All patients have suffered from dysfunctional voiding that is refractory to conventional treatment . The enrolled patients should have severe dysuria or urinary retention , large residual urine and have been treated with medication or other therapeutic modality for over 3 months . The patients will be randomly assigned to allocate in the treatment and control groups in a 2:1 ratio . About 40 and 20 patients will be enrolled in the treatment and control group , respectively . This study should be approved by the Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) and ethical committee of the hospital . Every patient should be thoroughly informed and written informed consent should be obtained before treatment . Patients will receive a complete urological work-up before treatment , including urinalysis , urine culture , cystoscopy to prove no anatomical stricture or lower urinary tract pathology , and videourodynamic study . All medication that may affect the lower urinary tract function will be stopped at least 1 week before Botulinum Toxin A ( BoNT-A ) injection . Videourodynamic study will be performed with the patient in supine position if patients can not stand up or sit on the commode . A 6 Fr dual channel urethral pressure profiles ( UPP ) urethral catheter will be inserted to the urinary bladder . After evacuation of the residual urine , urethral pressure profilometry will be performed first . Then the bladder will be filled with normal saline containing 20 % urografin at the filling rate of 30 ml/min . The filling and voiding cystourethrography will be investigated by a C-arm positioned below the patient . Uroflowmetry is recorded by a weighed transducer placed below the examination table . After the bladder is filled to the capacity , the patients are asked to urinate per urethrae . If patient can not urinate per urethrae with the urethral catheter in situ , suprapubic puncture with a 18 Gauge needle and a 3-Fr epidural catheter will be undertaken and patients will urinate without the catheter in the urethra . The patients are requested to stand up and urinate into the commode . Pressure flow study and concomitant voiding cystourethrography are performed . The urodynamic parameters include maximal urethral closure pressure ( MUCP ) , functional profile length ( FPL ) , cystometric bladder capacity ( CBC ) , bladder compliance , voiding detrusor pressure ( Pdet ) , maximal flow rate ( Qmax ) , voided volume , and postvoid residual urine volume ( PVR ) . In the patients who have detrusor underactivity , the abdominal pressure to urinate and the detrusor leak point pressure will be measured . Images of voiding cystourethrography will be emphasized on the bladder neck opening , urethral sphincter relaxation , and dilatation of posterior urethra during voiding . Patients will be admitted and BoNT-A ( treatment group ) or normal saline ( control group ) injections will be performed in the operation room where complete cardiovascular monitoring is available during the operation . BoNT-A injections are made under cystoscopy guide in male patients and injecting periurethrally in female patients . The BoNT-A will be purchased from Allergan Company ( Botox , 100 units/vial , Irvine , California , U.S.A. ) . Each vial of BoNT-A will be diluted to 5 ml by normal saline . A total of 100 units of BoNT-A will be injected deeply into the external sphincter at the 3 , 6 , 9 and 12 o'clock positions in approximate equal aliquot . After BoNT-A injections , a 14 Fr Foley catheter will be indwelled routinely for 1 day and then removed . Patients will be followed up for their voiding conditions . When dysuria persists , intermittent catheterization will be advised instead of indwelling Foley catheter . Antibiotics will not be necessary unless urinary tract infection occurs , and medications to reduce urethral sphincteric resistance are discontinued . Patients will be closely contacted and monitored by the research assistant by telephone . They will be followed up at out-patient clinic at 1 week , 2 weeks and 4 weeks after BoNT-A injections . After the first month after initial BoNT-A injection , patients will be followed up monthly until the therapeutic effect is gone . Videourodynamic study and UPP study will be performed at 4 weeks after BoNT-A injections . The subjective improvement of voiding condition will be assessed by the obstructive symptom scores ( including hesitancy , intermittency , dysuria , small caliber of urine ) and quality of life score which are adopted from the International Prostate Symptom Score ( IPSS ) system . The primary end-point is the change of Patient Perception of Bladder Condition ( PPBC ) at 4 weeks after the initial injection . If patients have a PPBC improved by two scales , they are considered as successfully treated , otherwise failed treatment . The subjective symptom score , quality of life score and urodynamic parameters will be compared at baseline and 4 weeks after BoNT-A injection within and between the treatment group and control groups . For the patients who do not have significant improvement 4 weeks after BoNT-A injections , a second injection with 100 units of BoNT-A will be performed at 4 weeks after the initial injection regardless the patient 's initial grouping . These patients will be followed up at the same interval until the return of voiding dysfunction . Continuous variables are presented as means ± standard deviations ( SDs ) , and categorical data are presented as numbers and percentages ( % ) . Statistical comparisons within group will be performed by paired t test , between the groups are tested using the chi-square test for categorical variables , and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test for continuous variables . Long-term successful results are compared using Kaplan-Meier analyses . Statistical assessments are considered significant when p < 0.05 . Statistical analyses will be performed using SPSS 15.0 statistical software ( SPSS Inc. , Chicago , IL ) . Any side effect related to the BoNT-A injections will be asked to report . There has not been reported to have serious side effect from local injection of BoNT-A to the urethral sphincter . However , the potential side effects , such as exacerbation of urinary incontinence , allergy and anaphylactic shock should be informed to the patients and carefully monitor the postoperative conditions . Urinalysis will be checked at the first follow-up 1 and 2 week after BoNT-A injection . Antibiotics will be given if patients have significant urinary tract infection .",2012-11-08,"March 7, 2017","Inclusion Criteria : Adults with age of 20 years old or above .

Institute for Human Genetics and Biochemistry,NCT01731691,"Safety and Efficacy of (α1Proteinase Inhibitor, α1PI) in HIV Disease",Institute for Human Genetics and Biochemistry,2,0,HIV Disease,Biological,α1 Proteinase Inhibitor,Basic Science,Triple,"Our primary objective is to further characterize the mechanism by which alpha-1PI regulates CD4 counts . HIV-1 infected patients will be initiated on PROLASTIN®-C ( Alpha-1 Proteinase Inhibitor [ Human ] , Grifols Biotherapeutics Inc. ) or placebo . Uninfected volunteers will be untreated and will be monitored for comparison .","This study protocol is designed to investigate the benefit of a well-tolerated , FDA approved biological product that has been extensively used in a different patient population . For more than 20 years , α1proteinase inhibitor ( α1PI or α1antitrypsin ) therapy has been the standard treatment for people with insufficient α1PI blood levels . This disorder , also known as α1antitrypsin deficiency , was previously thought to be caused only as an inherited trait due to the gene PIzz . Recent evidence shows that it can also be an acquired disease . Specifically , individuals with HIV-1 disease have been found to have severely low α1PI blood levels ( Bristow et al. , 2001 ; Bristow et al. , 2010 ; Bristow et al. , 2012 ) . Many people with the inherited version of α1PI deficiency eventually develop emphysema , and among individuals with HIV-1 disease , 90 % have acquired α1PI deficiency . Whether they go on to develop emphysema is still unresolved . HIV-1 infected individuals are the first patient population identified so far in which severe α1PI deficiency is acquired through infection rather than being inherited . It was found that a decrease in α1PI blood levels is directly correlated to a decrease in CD4 lymphocytes ( Bristow et al. , 2001 ; Bristow et al. , 2012 ) : In a pilot study to determine whether α1PI therapy might benefit the CD4 counts in HIV-1 infected patients ( Clinicaltrials.gov NCT01370018 ) , HIV-1 patients with infection-related α1PI deficiency received weekly α1PI therapy ( 120mg/kg ) for a period of 8 weeks and results were compared with those of patients having the inherited version of α1PI deficiency who were simultaneously receiving weekly α1PI therapy ( 60mg/kg ) . None of the patients in the study had ever previously received α1PI therapy . It was found that CD4 cells rose to normal levels following 2 weeks of intravenous α1PI therapy with no adverse effects observed in the HIV-1 patients ( n=3 ) or the control group of HIV-1 uninfected , α1PI deficiency patients ( n=2 ) . The new crop of CD4 cells were functional , capable of fighting infection , and appeared to be generated from bone marrow-derived stem cells ( Bristow et al. , 2010 ) . As a bonus , it was found in the HIV-1 patients that LDL levels ( bad cholesterol ) decreased and HDL levels ( good cholesterol ) increased { Bristow et al. , in review ) . The information gained from the initial pilot study will be incorporated into this study design to further characterize the mechanism of lymphocyte renewal and to increase the number of patients observed . Only minor modifications to the pilot protocol are proposed including the sample size , addition of volunteers not receiving therapy , and a double-blind design : Ten ( 10 ) HIV-1 infected patients will be dosed with PROLASTIN®-C ( Grifols Therapeutics Inc. ) , five ( 5 ) will be dosed with placebo , and five ( 5 ) uninfected volunteers not receiving therapy will be monitored . It has been observed that CD4 counts and cholesterol levels are correlated and that there is cyclic variation in individuals with and without HIV . To examine whether there are differences due to HIV infection in cyclic variation of CD4 counts , cholesterol levels , and other values monitored during this study , five ( 5 ) volunteers , who do not have HIV , will be included in the study for blood collection only . In a previous study , we determined that in individuals with abnormally low active α1PI levels , CD4 counts exhibit sinusoidal cycling with 23 day periodicity . Wave form appearance of CD4 cells with a peak every 23 days is a pattern that is indicative of adult thymopoiesis . We showed that in response to α1PI therapy , HIV infected and uninfected individuals exhibited an increased CD4 counts axis of oscillation , but no change in periodicity . In contrast , one uninfected individual who was not receiving therapy , exhibited no change in the axis of oscillation , but periodicity was 27 days . Human adult thymopoiesis is not well characterized , and based on these results , we have two hypotheses . One hypothesis is that in response to α1PI therapy , thymopoiesis will increase , manifested by an increased axis of oscillation and increased numbers of recent thymic emigrants . In the proposed study , we will perform weekly TREC analysis which measures recent thymic emigrants and is definitive for thymopoiesis . We will test whether the changes in TREC numbers corresponds with changes in the CD4 counts axis of oscillation in HIV infected individuals receiving α1PI therapy as compared with HIV infected individuals with abnormally low active α1PI levels not on α1PI therapy , and HIV uninfected individuals with normal active α1PI levels not on α1PI therapy . The second hypothesis is that in individuals with abnormally low active α1PI levels , the periodicity of CD4 counts is shorter than in individuals with normal active α1PI levels . Although we will measure periodicity in only 5 individuals with normal active α1PI levels and 15 with abnormal active α1PI levels , this will allow us to determine whether active α1PI is a linear determinate of periodicity or whether there are other variables that regulate periodicity . In an 8-week study , only 2 periods can be observed . Thus , following an 8-week regimen of therapy , one study subject may be asked to continue for a second 8-week regimen of therapy to allow the observation of 5 periods . In addition to these two primary hypotheses regarding CD4 counts , we have found that HDL and LDL levels are linearly dependent on the balance of active and inactive α1PI levels ( manuscript in review ) . This phenomenon is due the transport of HDL and LDL by CD4 cells . We found that in HIV infected individuals with abnormally low active α1PI and abnormally high inactive α1PI , HDL and LDL increased or decreased differently from individuals with normal active α1PI . Based on these results , our hypothesis is that in HIV infected individuals with abnormally low active α1PI receiving α1PI therapy , LDL levels will decrease and HDL levels will increase as active α1PI levels increase in contrast to HIV uninfected individuals with normal active α1PI levels not on therapy and in contrast to HIV infected individuals with abnormally low active α1PI levels not on therapy . Prolastin-C treatment will be given weekly for eight ( 8 ) to sixteen ( 16 ) weeks by intravenous infusion . Blood will be collected immediately prior to each infusion . As in the previous study , complete blood count , lymphocyte phenotype , extended lymphocyte phenotype , lymphocyte function ; HIV-1 viral load , lipid levels , blood chemistry , and markers of inflammation will be measured . The present study will also include measurements for HIV-1 tropism and markers for recent thymic emigrants .",2012-11-19,"August 22, 2020","Inclusion Criteria : HIV-1 patients must have confirmed HIV-1 disease , diagnosed using the standard criteria and be on antiretroviral therapy .

Recent aggregometric assays have shown that up to one third of acute coronary syndrome patients treated with clopidogrel have incomplete inhibition of adenosine diphosphate ( ADP ) -induced platelet aggregation while the number of patients treated with aspirin who have incomplete inhibition of thromboxane A2-induced platelet aggregation ( ASPI ) is much lower . High on-treatment platelet reactivity ( HTPR ) has been associated with an increased rate of ischemic events after PCI . However , recent large trials did not show a clinical benefit of TPR-guided therapy modification in acute coronary syndrome patients treated by PCI . On-treatment PLAtelet reactivity-guided Therapy modification FOR ST-segment elevation Myocardial infarction ( PLATFORM ) is an investigator-initiated , prospective , randomized , parallel-group , controlled clinical trial designed to test the hypothesis that antiplatelet therapy modification is superior to standard antiplatelet regimen among intermediate to high-risk STEMI patients undergoing PPCI . The safety hypothesis is that compared with control arm , interventional study arm will have similar rates of non-coronary artery bypass graft surgery-related bleeding . Approximately 632 ST-elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) patients with intermediate to high-risk ( RISK-PCI score > 3 ) clinical features undergoing PPCI will be randomly allocated to treatment modification or standard treatment . Low responders to aspirin will receive 200 mg aspirin for 30 days . Low responders to clopidogrel will receive 180 mg ticagrelor for 1 year . Patients will be followed up to 1 year after PPCI .","On-treatment PLAtelet reactivity-guided Therapy modification FOR ST-segment elevation Myocardial infarction ( PLATFORM ) is an investigator-initiated , prospective , open-label , randomized , parallel-group , actively controlled single-centre clinical trial . The research protocol has been approved by the Ethics Committee of the Clinical Centre of Serbia . All participants will have to provide their informed consent in writing . The trial design will ensure that all participants abide by good clinical practice and the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki II . Patients will be randomly allocated to antiplatelet regimen modification ( ARM , interventional arm ) or standard treatment ( control arm ) using a computer-generated 1:1 simple randomization scheme . TPR will be assessed in patients enrolled in the intervention arm of the trial . Low responders to aspirin will receive 200 mg aspirin for 30 days . Low responders to clopidogrel will receive 180 mg ticagrelor for 1 year . Patients enrolled in the control arm will receive standard antiplatelet regimen including 100 mg aspirin and 75 mg clopidogrel without assessment of TPR . The treating physicians will not be blinded to the intervention since an open design will make it possible for investigators to perform necessary adjustments of the antiplatelet regimen in accordance with TPR status . To minimize any possible bias inherent in the open design , endpoints will be evaluated by a blinded endpoint committee . Enrollment will start in June 2013 . Recruitment will continue until 632 patients have been randomized . The end of the recruitment period is planned for June 2015 . The trial will continue until all available survivors have been followed for at least 1 year . Aspirin 300 mg and clopidogrel 600 mg loading doses will be administered as early as possible before PPCI . Primary PCI will be performed via femoral or radial approach , using standard 6 French-7 French guiding catheters . The Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction ( TIMI ) blood flow will be measured by two experienced observers blinded to identity and the order of angiograms . Any disagreement will be resolved by a third observer . Unfractionated heparin will be started as 100 IU/kg bolus ( 60 IU/kg if glycoprotein ( GP ) IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitor was used ) ; the 12 IU/kg/h infusion will follow if clinically indicated . Proton-pump inhibitor pantoprazole or H2-blocker ranitidine will be given to selected patients at risk for gastrointestinal hemorrhage . GP IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitor tirofiban will be administered during the procedure in patients with evidence of high intracoronary thrombus burden according to the European Society of Cardiology guidelines . Multiple electrode aggregometry will be performed using the impedance aggregometer and under the monitoring of an official representative of the manufacturer ( Multiplate analyzer , Verum-Diagnostics , Munich , Germany ) . TPR results will be evaluated by 2 investigators who will be blinded to patient 's identity and treatment . Whole blood will be sampled 24 hours after the loading dose . In patients who received IIb/IIIa inhibitor tirofiban blood samples will be obtained at least 24 hours after the completion of tirofiban infusion . On-treatment platelet reactivity ( TPA ) above 50 % , compared to the basal value estimated by TRAP test , will be linked with low responsiveness . Patients will be followed-up after discharge from hospital for net adverse events up to 1 year after enrolment by scheduled telephone interviews and outpatient visits . Interviewers will be blinded to the randomization scheme and to the results of platelet aggregation . An independent Clinical Event Committee , composed of 3 cardiologists and 1 neurologist and blinded with respect to randomization allocation will review and adjudicate the occurrence of each suspected clinical end point .

VA Office of Research and Development,NCT01739335,Novel Therapeutics in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD): A Randomized Clinical Trial of Mifepristone,VA Office of Research and Development,2,1,"Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic",Drug,Mifepristone Oral Tablet [Korlym],Treatment,Double,"Posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) is a common and disabling psychiatric disorder for Veterans . Left untreated or under-treated , it can become a chronic condition associated with significant distress , depression , aggression , family disruption , substance abuse and an increased risk of morbidity and mortality . Considerable advances were made in the treatment of PTSD in recent years ; however , psychopharmacological treatments have been shown to be largely ineffective for Veterans with PTSD . To address this gap , this proposal seeks to test an innovative treatment approach in PTSD - pharmacological manipulation of the body 's major stress system ( the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( HPA ) axis ) with mifepristone . At high doses mifepristone is a glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) antagonist with peripheral and central nervous system effects , making it a compound of interest in the treatment of stress related disorders . There is abundant evidence of enhanced GR sensitivity in Veterans with PTSD which is thought to underlie some of the symptoms of PTSD and associated disturbances in mood and cognition . There is also evidence that short-term mifepristone treatment has sustained beneficial effects on mood , cognition and sleep disturbance in some neuropsychiatric conditions ( major depression , bipolar disorder , primary insomnia ) . The purpose of the study is to examine the effects of mifepristone to determine if it is efficacious in improving PTSD symptoms and associated clinical outcomes . To achieve these objectives , the investigators propose to conduct a Phase IIa , multi-site , double-blind , placebo controlled trial of mifepristone in male Veteran outpatients with chronic PTSD through the VA 's Cooperative Clinical Trial Award program . The investigators propose to enroll 90 subjects at multiple VA sites based on an estimated attrition rate of 20 % . Eligible Veterans will be randomly assigned to the treatment of mifepristone ( 600 mg/day ) or placebo for one week and followed for up to three months . The investigators will also describe the effects of mifepristone on several other clinical parameters including PTSD symptomology , depression severity , sleep quality , and functional impairment . Several measures of neuroendocrine functioning will also be obtained to explore the relationship of plasma cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone ( ACTH ) levels to clinical response and the time to addition of rescue medications .","Novel approaches to the treatment of post traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) in Veterans are urgently needed . This proposal seeks to test an innovative approach , one that involves careful pharmacological manipulation of the body 's major stress system , the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( HPA ) axis , using one dose of the FDA-approved drug , mifepristone ( 600 mg/day ) . The rationale for a treatment trial of mifepristone in PTSD is based on the wealth of knowledge available about persistent alterations of the HPA axis in PTSD and their interactions with the central and autonomic nervous system and the immune system . The most consistent HPA axis findings in PTSD , taken together , suggest there is increased sensitivity to the effects of glucocorticoids in the presence of increased central activation of the HPA axis . Among the most replicated neuroendocrine findings have been of elevated levels of corticotropin-releasing factor ( CRF ) in the cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) , an exaggerated cortisol response to emotional stressors , and an exaggerated suppression of cortisol to the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone ( DEX ) . The earliest studies of the effects of dexamethasone ( DEX ) using the standard 1.0 mg dose , found that PTSD , unlike major depression , was not associated with higher rates of cortisol non-suppression and there was a trend for lower cortisol levels post-DEX in PTSD . A lower dose ( 0.5 mg ) was employed to test the hypothesis of enhanced suppression of cortisol to DEX in Vietnam Veterans with PTSD , which was confirmed . Since then , with few exceptions , greater suppression of cortisol to low-dose DEX has been found in PTSD subjects , compared to unexposed and/or trauma-exposed controls without PTSD , in diverse samples , including samples of persons exposed to combat , natural disasters , domestic violence , the Holocaust , and childhood physical and sexual abuse . Furthermore , the extent of cortisol suppression is associated with PTSD symptom severity . The finding of a greater down-regulation of lymphocyte GR post-DEX suggests that the dexamethasone suppression test ( DST ) findings may be attributable to more responsive glucocorticoid receptors . More recent studies have demonstrated increased suppression of ACTH to DEX confirming increased glucocorticoid responsivity at the level of the pituitary . The studies of the effects of DEX on HPA axis activity suggest there is enhanced negative feedback inhibition of the HPA axis in PTSD . Such inhibition could help to explain why despite evidence of central HPA axis activation and an exaggerated response of cortisol to stressors and to ACTH stimulation in PTSD , 24-hour basal cortisol levels are not typically elevated and indeed are even sometimes low . Mifepristone is a selective type II glucocorticoid receptor antagonist with a favorable safety profile . It binds to the same site as the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone and blocks the negative feedback control of cortisol on the pituitary . Thus , mifepristone , because it directly antagonizes the glucocorticoid receptor , which has been found to be more sensitive in PTSD in several models , is ideally suited for use in determining the pathophysiological significance of increased glucocorticoid receptor sensitivity in PTSD and whether its attenuation is of therapeutic value . The investigators propose to study the clinical , neuropsychological , and neuroendocrine effects of short-term treatment with one dose of mifepristone ( 600 mg/day ) in a well-characterized sample of Veterans with PTSD to determine if this treatment is effective in achieving a clinical response in PTSD , as well as improving clinical symptoms and quality of life . Furthermore , if pulse therapy with mifepristone has sustained effects , it holds out the promise of a very different approach to pharmacological treatment , one that may be preferable to Veterans who do not want to be on psychopharmacological treatments continuously or long-term . Primary Objective 1 . To determine whether 600 mg of mifepristone daily for one week in male Veterans with chronic PTSD yields a sufficiently high proportion of clinical responders after one month to warrant more extensive and definitive research . Secondary Objectives To study the trajectories of Clinician Administered PTSD Scale ( CAPS ) ( CAPS ) ( past week symptom status ) scores over the study duration for mifepristone and placebo . To determine the effect of mifepristone compared to placebo on the time to addition of rescue medication . To determine if a Phase III study is justified . To compare adverse events ( AEs ) and serious adverse events ( SAEs ) in the two groups . This Phase IIa clinical trial seeks to enroll 90 eligible male Veterans ( assumes 20 % attrition rate ) with chronic PTSD . Participants will be randomly assigned to treatment with 600 mg/day mifepristone or placebo for one week and assessed for clinical outcomes at one and three months follow-up . Eligibility will be based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria which are enumerated below and in the Human Participants section . The investigators plan to include male Veterans with chronic PTSD who are not receiving psychotropic medication . The inclusion and exclusion criteria were selected in order to include as representative a sample as possible while also addressing safety concerns . Veterans who are actively suicidal as assessed by the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale ( C-SSRS ) or who have attempted suicide within the past two years will be excluded . ( If suicidality is identified , the necessary steps will be taken to ensure the appropriate clinical care is provided , and the local suicide prevention policies implemented . ) Veterans with adrenal insufficiency will be excluded , as will Veterans with other major medical or neurological illnesses , as they may be at increased risk of developing adverse events . Veterans with renal disease/impairment , hepatic disease/impairment , cardiac illness ( e.g . coronary vascular disease , congestive heart failure ) , or hypokalemia at screening will also be excluded . Since mifepristone use can prolong the corrected QT ( QTc ) interval in a dose-related manner , Veterans with a prolonged QTc interval , defined as > 450 msec , on the ECG at screening will be excluded . To evaluate QTc prolongation post-mifepristone treatment , an ECG will also be performed at both the 3 day follow up visit ( visit 1.5 ) and 1 week follow-up visit ( week 1 , visit 2 ) . Participants on potent CYP3A4 inhibitors ( fluconazole , ketoconazole , itraconazole , erythromycin , rifampin ) and some anticonvulsants ( e.g. , phenytoin , phenobarbital , and carbamazepine ) will be excluded since these medications impact the metabolism of mifepristone ( see Risk/Benefit Assessment for details ) . Due to an increased risk of adverse drug reactions , Veterans taking simvastatin , lovastatin , fentanyl , pimozide , bupropion , nefazodone , dihydroergotamine , ergotamine , quinidine , sirolimus , carvedilol , propanolol , diltiazem , verapamil or tacrolimus will also be excluded . Since the impact of mifepristone on the male reproductive system has not been extensively studied , only Veterans willing to use effective means of birth control for up to 90 days after mifepristone ingestion will be eligible ; this will cover the critical period of fetal development . Psychotropic medication use is exclusionary at study entry ; Veterans who have been previously treated with a stable regimen may not be enrolled until a minimum of five half-lives have elapsed since the Veteran last took any psychotropic medications . ( Sleep aids such as trazodone ( up to 50 mg/day ) or zolpidem ( up to 10 mg/day ) may be offered to Veterans with insomnia on an as-needed basis at the onset of the study . ) Major depression and other anxiety disorders are not exclusionary since they frequently co-occur with PTSD and it remains unclear whether their presence represents true comorbidity , symptom overlap , or severe illness . Since mild head trauma is common in the military population in general , excluding such participants would diminish the generalizability of the sample ; participants with severe traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) , defined as an extended period of unconsciousness or amnesia following injury , will be excluded . The Ohio State University ( OSU ) TBI Identification Method will be used to assess lifetime history of TBI . This method first establishes all significant injuries in one 's life and then determines if a TBI may have occurred based on whether the participant experienced a loss of consciousness ( LOC ) and , if so , for how long . A person is said to have a mild TBI if LOC does not exceed 30 minutes for any injury , a moderate TBI if LOC is between 30 minutes and 24 hours , and a severe TBI if LOC exceeds 24 hours . The OSU TBI assessment will be administered by a trained rater during the psychiatric evaluation conducted at screening . Additionally , Veterans diagnosed with alcohol/substance abuse and dependence will be excluded only if they are recently engaged in a maladaptive pattern of use or abuse . More specifically , persons who meet diagnostic criteria for alcohol/substance dependence will be excluded if they have manifested dependence within the previous three months ( i.e. , have met three or more of the seven criteria for a maladaptive pattern of use in the last three months ) . Persons with alcohol/substance abuse ( who , by definition , do not meet criteria for alcohol dependence ) will be excluded if they have shown a maladaptive pattern of alcohol use during the past one month ( i.e. , have met one or more of the four criteria for a maladaptive pattern of abuse ) . Veterans who are currently receiving psychotherapies - individually or in a group setting - that are considered to have significant benefit for PTSD , according to the VA and Department of Defense ( DoD 's ) Treatment Guidelines , will also be excluded . These therapies are cognitive therapy for PTSD ( e.g . cognitive processing therapy ( CPT ) ) , exposure therapy ( e.g. , prolonged exposure therapy ) , stress inoculation training , and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing ( EMDR ) . Other forms of therapy and case management which do not specifically target PTSD symptoms and/or have not been shown to provide significant benefit in PTSD will be allowed at entry and throughout the study ( e.g . supportive therapy , psychodynamic therapy , anger management , cognitive behavioral therapy for symptoms or problems other than PTSD ) . The investigators recognize that PTSD in women is increasingly common and effective treatments are needed for this group as well . However , women will be excluded from this initial trial for safety reasons , since mifepristone is an abortifacient . Should mifepristone prove to be effective in male Veterans with PTSD , this would provide a rationale for future studies in women , employing additional safeguards .",2012-11-15,"January 22, 2018","Inclusion Criteria : Participant is a male veteran .

The investigators would like to better understand whether orally administered steroids results in superior results when compared with nasally sprayed steroids . The investigators propose to test the hypothesis that for patients with radiographically proven CRSsNP , routine medical therapy consisting of a short course of systemic corticosteroids is superior to topical corticosteroids for relieving inflammation and the symptoms of CRS .","Chronic sinus infections ( chronic sinusitis or CRS ) are common conditions that affect millions of Americans . While this is a common disorder , medical treatments for this condition vary a lot and little is known how and why different treatments work in some individuals and not in others . Some physicians commonly utilize a course of oral steroid therapy similar to treatment of inflammatory conditions including asthma and arthritis . Other physicians feel that oral steroids are not more effective than nasal steroid sprays in reducing inflammation and prefer prescribing nasal steroids . There is no conclusive data as to whether oral or sprayed nasal steroids are more effective in providing long-term benefit to patients . Nasal steroids are FDA approved to treat some types of chronic sinusitis but oral steroids are FDA approved medications that are used to treat inflammatory conditions but is not specifically indicated for chronic sinusitis and thus should be regarded as investigational drug . The purpose of this research study is to better understand whether orally administered steroids results in superior results when compared with nasally sprayed steroids .

We expect increased responses in blood pressure and sodium excretion is expected during nebivolol treatment compared to placebo .,"Beta-blockers are no longer recommended as first line treatment in essential hypertension . Evidence mainly based on clinical trails with the non-vasodilating beta-blockers atenolol and propanolol points towards that beta-blockers have an increased risk of stroke compared to ACE-inhibitors , calcium channel blockers and thiazides . However , this Nebivolol is a third generation beta-blocker with vasodilating properties . Nebivolol decreases peripheral blood pressure to the same extend as other beta-blockers but in contrast to atenolol nebivolol also reduces central blood pressure . Furthermore nebivolol increases nitric oxide ( NO ) availability in forearm vessels , maybe through activation of beta-3 receptors . The nitric oxide system plays a central role in both renal sodium and water handling and regulation of vascular tone and blood pressure . It has not been investigated if nebivolol changes NO availability in the kidney . Investigators want investigate the following hypothesis : Nebivolol increases nitric oxide activity in the systemic circulation and the kidney The increased activity of nitric oxide during nebivolol treatment can be demonstrated by inhibition of NO synthesis with L-NMMA . Investigators expect increased responses in blood pressure and sodium excretion is expected during nebivolol treatment compared to placebo . Purpose The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of nebivolol on renal handling of sodium and water ( Glomerular filtration rate , urine production , free water clearance , excretion of proteins from epithelial sodium channels ( u-ENaCαβγ ) and aquaporin channels ( u-AQP2 ) and sodium and potassium excretion ) , plasma concentrations of vasoactive hormones ( renin , angiotensin II , aldosterone , vasopressin , atrial natriuretic peptide , brain natriuretic peptide and endothelin ) , central blood pressure , pulse wave velocity ( PWV ) and augmentation index , under basal conditions and during inhibition of nitric oxide synthesis in patients with essential hypertension .

National Institutes of Health Clinical Center (CC),NCT01675141,Lenalidomide Maintenance Therapy for Multiple Myeloma,National Cancer Institute (NCI),2,0,Multiple Myeloma,Drug,Lenalidomide,Treatment,,"Background : Multiple myeloma is rarely curable , but it is treatable . Initial treatment is directed at controlling symptoms and reducing the number of myeloma cells . It continues until the cancer stops responding to treatment . At that time , treatment may switch to maintenance therapy , which is given to try to extend the response of the first therapy for as long as possible . Research suggests that lenalidomide maintenance therapy may delay the time for myeloma cells to start to grow and possibly improve survival . Lenalidomide is a drug that may reduce or prevent the growth of cancer cells . Researchers want to look at the long-term effect of lenalidomide on immune cells . It will also look at the effects of extended treatment on the cancer and the immune system . Objectives : - To test the long-term effectiveness of lenalidomide therapy for multiple myeloma . Eligibility : - Individuals at least 18 years of age with newly diagnosed or relapsed multiple myeloma . Design : Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history . Blood and urine sample will be collected . A bone scan and bone marrow biopsy will also be performed . Participants will receive lenalidomide maintenance treatment . It will be given according to the standard of care for multiple myeloma . Participants will take lenalidomide every day for 21 days of repeated 28-day cycles . Treatment will be monitored with frequent blood tests . Blood tests will look at the effect of the treatment on the immune system . Treatment will continue as long as the cancer does not worsen and the side effects are not severe .","Background : Multiple myeloma ( MM ) remains largely an incurable disease with an estimated median survival of 6-7 years in standard risk myeloma and 2-3 years in high risk disease despite treatment with autologous stem cell transplantation ( ASCT ) . Maintenance therapy to achieve sustained suppression of residual disease following chemotherapy or ASCT has long been viewed as a desirable approach for extending survival in MM . Giving the immunomodulatory drug lenalidomide after induction or re-induction treatment may stimulate the immune system in various ways to stop or slow the return of cancer . It is not yet known how immune stimulatory effects of extended dosing with lenalidomide in the maintenance setting correlate with clinical benefits . Objectives : Assess T cell ( cluster of differentiation 4 ( CD4 ) , cluster of differentiation 8 ( CD8 ) , natural killer T cell ( NKT ) and normal killer ( NK ) cell numbers in peripheral blood during the course of lenalidomide maintenance therapy in treated MM patients .

It is also not clear whether Orlistat , that is FDA approved for weight loss , is effective in lowering blood fat levels in patients with Type 1 hyperlipoproteinemia ( T1HLP ) . The researchers are interested in learning whether any one of these drugs when given alone or in combination is more effective and safe in treating T1HLP .","Type I hyperlipoproteinemia is a rare , autosomal recessive metabolic disorder characterized by extreme hypertriglyceridemia due to a deficiency in lipoprotein lipase or related proteins . Treatment of these patients is challenging as triglyceride-lowering medications are ineffective . A low fat diet is helpful , however , despite good dietary compliance , some patients continue to have severe hypertriglyceridemia and recurrent pancreatitis which can be life threatening . Therefore , we wish to investigate whether inducing dietary fat malabsorption or inhibiting chylomicron formation will cause further lowering of serum triglycerides ( TG ) beyond the effect of limiting dietary fat intake . We will study the efficacy and safety of an inhibitor of intestinal lipase ( Orlistat ) and an intestinal-specific inhibitor of microsomal triglyceride transport protein ( MTP ) involved in the assembly and secretion of chylomicrons ( SLx-4090 ) , alone and in combination , for reducing serum triglyceride levels in patients with Type I hyperlipoproteinemia .

To this purpose the investigators designed a double blind randomized controlled trial comparing PRP vs viscosupplementation . A power analysis has been performed for the primary endpoint of IKDC ( International Knee Documentation Committee ) subjective score improvement at the 12-month follow-up for PRP . From a pilot study , a standard deviation of 15.2 points was found . With an alpha error of 0.05 , a beta error of 0.2 and a minimal clinically significant difference of 6.7 points corresponding at 1/3 of the documented mean improvement , the minimum sample size was 83 for each group . Considering a possible drop out of 15 % , 96 patients per group are required for total 192 patients , selected according to well-defined inclusion criteria ( see 'Eligibility criteria ' section ) . Patients are then assigned to two different treatment groups , according to a randomization list . The first group of treatment consists of three weekly intra-articular injections of autologous PRP obtained with the following procedure : a 150-ml autologous venous blood sample undergoes 2 centrifugations ( the first at 1480 rpm for 6 minutes to separate erythrocytes , and a second at 3400 rpm for 15 minutes to concentrate platelets ) to produced 20 ml of PRP . This unit of PRP is then divided into 4 small units of 5 ml each . One unit is sent to the laboratory for analysis of platelet concentration and for a quality test , 3 units are stored at -30° C. The second treatment group consists of patients receiving three weekly injections of hyaluronic acid ( Hyalubrix 30 mg/2ml , Fidia Farmaceutici Spa , Italy ; Molecular Weight : 1500 kDa ) . To guarantee the blinding of the patients , all of them undergo blood harvesting to obtain autologous PRP which will be used only in half of them , according to the aforementioned randomization list . One week after the PRP production , the injective treatment starts , with 3 weekly injections of PRP or HA . At the moment of the injection the syringe is properly covered to prevent the patient from discovering the substance he was receiving . After the injection , patients are sent home with instructions to limit the use of the leg for at least 24 h and to use cold therapy/ice on the affected area to relieve pain . During this period , the use of non-steroidal medication is forbidden . Patients are prospectively evaluated basally and at 2 , 6 , and 12 months of follow-up using clinical subjective scores and objective parameters to determine clinical outcome ( see 'Outcome measure ' section ) . Patient satisfaction and adverse events will be also reported . All the clinical evaluations are performed by a medical staff not involved in the injective procedure , in order to keep the study double blinded . At the end of the study , the nature of the injected substance is revealed to the patients .","Current research is investigating new methods for stimulating repair or replacing damaged cartilage . In particular , the most recent knowledge regarding tissue biology highlights a complex regulation of growth factors ( GFs ) for the normal tissue structure and the reaction to tissue damage . The influence of GFs on cartilage repair is now widely investigated in vitro and in vivo . Platelet Rich Plasma ( PRP ) is a simple , low- cost and minimally- invasive method that allows one to obtain a natural concentrate of autologous GFs from the blood , and it is increasingly applied in the clinical practice to treat knee degenerative pathology , such as chondropathy and early osteoarthritis ( OA ) . The biological rational of PRP is that platelets contain storage pools of GFs , cytokines , chemokines and many other mediators.Although its widespread application , there are no high level studies in the literature to demonstrate the real efficacy of PRP . In fact , at the present moment , to our knowledge there is no published randomized controlled trial comparing PRP with other conservative treatments commonly used for knee OA . The investigators hypothesized that intra-articular injections of PRP to treat knee degenerative articular cartilage pathology could determine pain relief and recovery of knee function with overall clinical outcome comparable or even better than viscosupplementation , which is a common injective approach applied in this kind of pathology .

During this period , the use of non-steroidal medication is forbidden . Furthermore , at the moment of each weekly injection , before injecting the substance , an attempt of harvesting synovial fluid is performed . During the same visit , also a peripheral blood sample ( 3 ml ) is taken . These samples are then sent to a dedicated Laboratory in order to test the concentration of some GFs , pro and anti-inflammatory cytokines , both at local ( synovial fluid ) and systemic level ( peripheral blood ) . The aim is to evaluate the trend in the concentration rate of these molecules over the period of the injective treatment . Patients are prospectively evaluated basally and at 2 , 6 , and 12 months of follow-up using IKDC , KOOS ( Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score ) , EQ-VAS ( Visual Analogue Scale ) for general health status , and Tegner scores .

Wake Forest University Health Sciences,NCT01674478,Early Supplementation of Enteral Microlipid With and Without Fish Oil in Premature Infants With Enterostomies,Wake Forest University,2,1,Prematurity,Dietary Supplement,Microlipid with fish oil,Prevention,,"Necrotizing enterocolitis ( NEC ) and spontaneous intestinal perforation ( SIP ) are common devastating gastrointestinal diseases in premature infants . These infants often need surgical intervention to remove the dead bowel and create temporary enterostomies , resulting in short bowel syndrome ( SBS ) , a malabsorption state due to insufficient bowel length or dysfunction to digest and absorb nutrients adequately . These infants are often nourished primarily with parental nutrition ( PN ) which can lead to many complications including PN-associated liver disease . However , with enteral feeding , the remaining bowel can adapt somewhat to the shortened state , reducing the need for PN . Enteral fats appear to be the most trophic macronutrients with the long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids ( LCPUFA ) being the most beneficial in promoting bowel adaptation . Fish oil ( FO ) , a main source of n-3 LCPUFA , has been shown to promote bowel adaptation . Microlipid ( ML ) primarily contains n-6 PUFA and has been found to decrease ostomy output and increase weight gain in some SBS infants . WThe investigators will soon have completed a randomized clinical trial ( EMLFO trial ) ( WFUHS IRB00011501 , NCT01306838 ) entitled `` Early Supplementation of Enteral Lipid with Combination of Microlipid and Fish Oil in Infants with Enterostomies '' . The preliminary data suggest that ( a ) by supplementing enteral ML/FO , we were able to decrease the use of IL ; ( b ) premature infants in the treatment group who received ML/FO achieved higher enteral calorie ( % of total calorie ) intake before reanastomosis and better weight gain ( g/day ) after reanastomosis than those who received routine care in control group ; and ( c ) the direct bilirubin level before reanastomosis tended to be lower in the treatment group than the control group although the difference was not statistically significant . Because the intervention consisted of both an increase in enteral fat intake as well as a specific type of fat intake ( i.e . FO ) , it is unclear whether improved outcomes in the ML/FO group are attributable to FO 's anti-inflammatory effects or the increased fat intake . Therefore , the investigators have designed a next randomized clinical trial to compare ML alone versus ML plus FO . We hypothesize that as compared to ML alone , ML plus FO will result in decreased systemic inflammation , as indicated by blood levels of inflammation-related proteins and indicators of oxidative stress .","In comparison to EMLFO trial , the EMLFO-2 study will modify the eligibility criteria to only enroll the infants who have birthweight equal to or less than 1250 g with a jejunostomy or ileostomy as the result of surgical treatment for small intestine perforation or NEC in order to increase the homogeneity of patient population .",2012-08-18,"November 7, 2018","Inclusion Criteria : infants ( age range : newborn to ≤ 2-month-old ) whose birth weight are ≤ 1250g ; who are admitted to BCH NICU for surgical intervention for NEC or small intestine perforation and then to have a jejunostomy or ileostomy ; who are expected to need full or partial PN for at least 21days from the day of ostomy placement ; and who have received enteral feedings ≤ 4 days since ostomy placement .

The standard treatment is one week of detoxification assisted with diazepam and symptomatic treatment followed by one week of rehabilitation . However , diazepam is highly addictive and widely abused among heroin users and pharmacologically , does not reduce the physical and psychological craving for opioids which can trigger relapse . Many opiate patients undergoing inpatient detoxification leave prematurely ( i.e . PID : patient initiated discharge ) because of the severity of unpleasant withdrawal symptoms .

Our expected study outcomes are as following : Significantly lower mean scores on the Objective Opiate Withdrawal Scale ( OOWS ) on day 3 and 4 of detox among patients in the lofexidine arm relative to those in the benzodiazepine arm Significantly lower mean scores on the Subjective experience of opiate withdrawal scale ( SOWS ) on day 3 and 4 of detox among patients in the lofexidine arm relative to those in the benzodiazepine arm Significantly larger pupil size on day 3 and 4 of detox among patients in the lofexidine arm relative to those in the benzodiazepine arm Significantly lower mean craving score on the Visual Analogue Scale on day 3 and 4 of detox among patients in the lofexidine arm relative to those in the benzodiazepine arm Significantly longer stay ( days ) on the ward among patients in the lofexidine arm relative to those in the benzodiazepine arm Significantly lower anxiety and depression score on the MAP among patients in the lofexidine arm relative to those in the benzodiazepine arm Safety Assessment and Monitoring : After signing the informed consent , the subject will undergo screening assessments to determine eligibility for study enrollment ; the screen tests include FBC , LFT , Renal function and 12-lead ECG , and urine pregnancy test if female . A complete physical examination will be performed on the first day of screening . From Day 1 till discharge , Vital Signs ( e.g . pulse rate , body temperature , blood pressure and respiratory rate ) will be closely monitored by the study nurses at the ward , i.e . immediately prior to each lofexidine dose and in addition , 2 hours after the first dose of each dosing day . Should patients show signs of hypotension , the nurse will inform the investigators and they will determine whether or not it is necessary to terminate the patients ' participation in the trial . Patients will be required to repeat a 12-lead ECG test when they complete the study or if they drop out of the study . If there is any significant finding from the repeat ECG , it will be followed through by the investigators until resolved . All the adverse events will be documented and followed through until resolved during the study period .

Individual patients or the entire study will be discontinued if there is any major safety finding . Sample Size and Statistical methods : The estimate of 122 subjects ( 61 per group ) for the sample size is based on the following assumptions - mean ( SE ) OOWS scores on day 4 of 2.4 ( 0.4000 ) and 3.9 ( 2.7713 ) for the lofexidine and diazepam groups respectively ( which implies an expected absolute treatment effect of 1.5 ) , a power of 80 % , and allowing for 30 % of the patients dropping out before their evaluation on day 4 . Thirty percent dropout implies that 86 subjects ( 43 per group ) are required to evaluate the benefit of lofexidine over diazepam . The primary efficacy analysis will be done using the ITT dataset and the safety profile will be described using the safety dataset . All analysis will be conducted by independent statisticians ( SCRI ) .",2012-08-16,"August 26, 2015","Inclusion Criteria : Patients who meet the DSM-IV criteria for a diagnosis of opiate dependence ( as diagnosed by a NAMS psychiatrist ) .

University of Alberta,NCT01596166,Intravenous Ketorolac and Metoclopramide for Pediatric Migraine in the Emergency Department,University of Alberta,4,1,Probable Migraine,Drug,Ketorolac Tromethamine,Treatment,Triple,"Migraine headaches are a common problem for children . When treatment at home fails , children may benefit from intravenous treatment administered in a hospital setting like the Emergency Department . Most treatments used however have only been tested in adults and the best treatment strategy for children is not always clear . The combination of more than one medication is frequently prescribed in Canadian Emergency Departments . The purpose of this study is to investigate whether the combination of ketorolac ( an anti-inflammatory pain medication ) and metoclopramide ( an anti-nauseant that may also relieve migraine headaches ) is better than metoclopramide by itself .","Migraine headache is a painful condition of recurrent moderate to severe head pain associated with nausea , vomiting , photophobia , and phonophobia . The condition is highly prevalent and a significant community health problem with considerable impact on the health care system . To alleviate the pain and morbidity associated with a migraine attack , drug therapies are often employed including simple analgesics like ibuprofen and migraine-specific medications like sumatriptan . When these treatments fail or in severe , intractable cases , patients and families may present to the Emergency Department ( ED ) . Ketorolac in combination with metoclopramide or prochlorperazine was the most common multi-drug combination used in 36 % of ED presentations for migraine across Canada in our national practice variation study . The scientific rationale for combining a non-selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAID ) with inhibition of both the cyclooxygenase ( COX ) 1 and 2 isoenzymes with other migraine therapies is enticing ; however , no studies have specifically examined the relative efficacy of the practice . Why would the combination of a non-selective NSAID like ketorolac with other migraine therapies improve treatment outcomes ? The benefit of multi-target combinations may be relate to the duration of the migraine and the multiple brain areas involved in sustained pain . It has long been recognized that patients who treat their migraine headaches early at the onset have a better response . The underlying mechanism for this phenomenon has now been identified . The initiation of migraine pain requires activation of the trigeminal ( 5th cranial nerve ) nociceptive ( pain ) system . Activation of these sensory fibers within the arachnoid membrane on the surface of the brain produces the first and most common painful manifestation of migraine - the pulsatile headache . With each heartbeat , minor dilation of the cerebral blood vessels produces stretch and a painful activation of the trigeminal fibers known as peripheral sensitization . The second phase in the maintenance of a migraine attack over several hours is the sensitization of trigeminal pain pathways leading to higher brain centers known as central sensitization . The efficacy of medications like the triptans is greater early in the course of a migraine attack when there is only peripheral sensitization and before the onset of central sensitization . Non-selective NSAIDs like naproxen sodium and ketorolac may be uniquely effective in the reduction of central sensitization in the animal model of migraine and the reduction of migraine pain in adult patients late in the course of a migraine headache . The population of patients in the ED is uniquely different from outpatients in that most have developed their migraine headache hours or days before presenting . In our practice variation study , the mean duration of the migraine prior to presenting to the ED was 2 days . Including an NSAID when treating a prolonged migraine in the ED may thus increase the therapeutic window and improve outcomes . While many Canadian ED physicians have adopted the practice of combining ketorolac with other migraine therapies , the gold standard assessment of efficacy and safety in a randomized clinical trial has not been applied .",2012-05-08,"January 21, 2015","Inclusion Criteria : A patient is legible to participate in this study if they meet the following criteria : Patient is between 6 and 17 years of age inclusive Treatment with usual therapy at home or at least one dose of oral ibuprofen or acetaminophen has not provided satisfactory relief Intravenous therapy is indicated in the opinion of the treating ED physician Patient has a history of migraine as defined by the International Classification of Headache Disorders - 2nd edition ( Appendix 1 ) and meets the following criteria : During headache , at least 1 of the following : nausea and/or vomiting ; two of five symptoms ( photophobia , phonophobia , difficulty thinking , lightheadedness , or fatigue ) .

Asan Medical Center,NCT01595685,Telbivudine Versus Entecavir in Reducing Serum HBsAg Levels in Patients With HBeAg-positive Chronic Hepatitis B,Asan Medical Center,3,1,Chronic Viral Hepatitis B Without Delta-agent,Drug,Telbivudine,Treatment,,"The goal of chronic hepatitis B ( CHB ) treatment is complete and permanent eradication of hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) from patient 's body , which is best represented by serum HBsAg loss accompanied by undetectable serum HBV DNA level . While the most recently approved nucleos ( t ) ide analogues ( NA ) have marked antiviral potency and can induce HBV DNA undetectability in the majority of patients through prolonged treatment , NA need to be given long term , almost indefinitely , in most cases because they suppress HBV DNA only during therapy . For example , even after HBeAg-loss by a potent NA , suppression of serum HBV DNA to undetectable level is sustained only in about 23 % -37 % at 24 weeks off treatment . Thus , continuous therapy with NA until HBsAg clearance remains necessary in a majority of cases . The recent availability of commercial quantitative assays of serum hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) has enabled quantitative HBsAg to be used as a biomarker for prognosis and treatment response in CHB . It has been suggested that HBsAg decline during lamivudine or entecavir therapy is slower and less pronounced compared to interferon treatment , despite a higher effect on HBV DNA suppression . Based on HBsAg kinetics , it has been estimated that the predicted median time to HBsAg loss in patients treated with lamivudine or entecavir is more than 30 years . Thus , treatment that can induce rapid decline of HBsAg would have clear advantage in reducing the treatment duration required to achieve HBsAg-loss . Interestingly , in a recent preliminary study , 24-weeks of treatment with telbivudine has induced HBsAg decline as comparable to pegylated interferon treatment . Although there has been no head-to-head trial comparing NAs in inducing HBsAg decline , previous studies consistently suggested that the decline of HBsAg is greater during telbivudine treatment compared with lamivudine or entecavir . Thus , in this clinical trial , the investigators will investigate whether telbivudine is more effective in inducing HBsAg decline compared with entecavir in HBeAg-positive CHB patients who have achieved undetectable serum HBV DNA by preceding entecavir treatment .","A single-center randomized active-controlled open-label superiority trial Patients will be randomly assigned 1:1 to receive telbivudine ( 600 mg/day ) or ongoing entecavir ( 0.5 mg/day ) for 48 weeks .

Because over 98 % of Korean patients with CHB have HBV genotype C,9 HBV genotype will not determined or be regarded as a stratification factor . There will be no interruption in entecavir therapy before randomization . Patients ' treatment information will be retrospectively collected during entecavir treatment phase as well ( DNA change , HBeAg status , HBsAg titre , ALT , and treatment duration . etc ) Patients will be screened within 4 weeks before randomization to determine study eligibility .",2012-05-08,"January 24, 2017","Inclusion Criteria : All of below HBsAg titer > 1,000 IU/mL HBeAg positive at study entry and at the baseline of ETV treatment HBV DNA undetectable ( 1.4 ) Pregnant woman or willing to be pregnant woman or man",98,0,18 Years,80 Years

The rationale for these studies is derived from growing evidence that insulin contributes to multiple brain functions , and that insulin dysregulation can contribute to AD pathogenesis . Thus , therapies aimed at restoring normal insulin signaling in the CNS may have beneficial effects on brain function . Intranasal administration of insulin increases insulin signaling in the brain without raising peripheral levels and causing hypoglycemia . Insulin detemir is an insulin analogue that may have better action in brain than other insulin formulations because of its albumin binding properties . The investigators will test the therapeutic effects of intranasally-administered insulin detemir in a study in which participants will receive insulin detemir , regular insulin , or placebo over a four month period . The investigators will test the hypothesis that insulin and insulin detemir will both improve memory and daily functioning in persons with AD/aMCI compared with placebo , but that insulin detemir will have the greatest effect .","It is well-known that insulin , a hormone that is naturally secreted by the pancreas , plays an important physiological role by regulating blood sugar levels in the body . Researchers now know that insulin plays many important roles in the brain as well . Insulin seems to be especially active in the part of the brain that corresponds to learning and memory . Studies have shown that when people have insufficient insulin in the brain ( which , for example , is the case with Type-II diabetes ) , they are increasingly at risk to develop memory problems and Alzheimer 's disease . In a past study , the investigators administered intravenous insulin to participants and found that it improves memory . However , that particular method would not be a practical intervention for people with Alzheimer 's disease due to the risks of hypoglycemia or exacerbation of insulin resistance . Instead , the investigators use an `` intranasal '' method of administration , in which the insulin is inserted into a device , and administered intranasally . In this method , the insulin travels directly to the brain , and bypasses the body . Past studies have also demonstrated that this can be a reliable way to improve memory , and it does not change the body 's blood glucose levels . In our past studies , investigators have used regular insulin , which lasts about 3-4 hours and creates a similar `` spike '' in insulin that one would have after eating a meal . However , in normal physiology , the pancreas also releases small and more constant `` pulses '' of insulin throughout the day and night , establishing a base level of insulin . Accordingly , several longer-lasting types of insulin are now available that last closer to 10-12 hours , mimicking that basal level of insulin . The current study uses a long-lasting type of insulin called `` insulin detemir , '' to determine if learning and memory will benefit from a more consistent supplement of insulin . The investigators want to determine whether this treatment can benefit people who already have a memory impairment-either they have a diagnosis of Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) or have a mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) , a condition that precedes Alzheimer 's disease . The investigators will examine cognition , daily function , cerebral blood flow , and different markers of Alzheimer 's disease that are in the blood and cerebral spinal fluid ( CSF ) as outcome measures . The investigators have these specific aims : We will test the hypothesis that compared to placebo , four months of treatment with intranasal insulin or insulin detemir will improve cognition and function in adults with AD or MCI , but that greater effects will be observed for insulin detemir . We will examine the effects of intranasal insulin and insulin detemir on cerebral blood flow in adults with AD or MCI . We will examine the effects of intranasal insulin and insulin detemir on CSF Aβ , tau and inflammatory markers in adults with AD or MCI . To examine these hypotheses , the investigators are recruiting approximately 90 participants who have been diagnosed with AD or mild cognitive impairment . They will be randomly selected to take a placebo ( saline ) , insulin detemir , or insulin . Cognition , the level of daily functioning , glucose tolerance , and cerebral blood flow will be tested before they begin the study drug , and after 16 weeks of the study drug . Some participants will also undergo a lumbar puncture both before beginning study drug and after 16 weeks of taking the study drug . Statistical analysis will follow an intent-to-treat ( ITT ) approach ; that is , subjects will be analyzed in their original randomized group regardless of adherence to group assignment . A completer analysis will also be performed , including only those subjects who successfully complete the treatment phase . Missing data will be handled using multiple imputation linear regression . We will conduct secondary analyses on other measures of cognition , daily function , cerebral blood flow , and CSF biomarkers . For ASL-MRI , following coregistration and processing , parametric maps will be generated to determine regional CBF values by treatment group . Secondary analyses will also examine treatment duration ( 2-month vs. 4-month ) for all relevant outcomes . All models will be adjusted for age and an index of peripheral insulin sensitivity ( derived from 120-minute OGTT glucose and insulin values ) if statistically warranted , and posthoc contrasts will be performed when appropriate . Secondary analyses will also evaluate whether treatment response of cognition , daily function , CSF and plasma markers , and insulin differ according to APOE4 genotype . Although these analyses will be exploratory due to possible limited APOE4 by treatment arm cell size , the data will be examined for statistical trends that warrant further exploration in larger trials . Other secondary analyses will examine associations among treatment-related outcomes using scores derived from multiple regression of data collected during the treatment phase residualized with respect to baseline values .",2012-05-08,"November 13, 2020","Inclusion Criteria : Age 50-89 Diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment , or mild/moderate AD Exclusion Criteria : Excessively high or low blood pressure , heart rate Pre-existing diabetes not controlled by exercise/diet Previous/current use of insulin Significant elevations in lipids , liver enzymes Menstrual period within the last 12 months Significant neurological or medical disorder ( other than AD ) Significant use of nasal decongestants Current use of anti-psychotic , anti-convulsive , anxiolytic , glucocorticoids , or sedative medications",37,0,50 Years,89 Years

Diet restrictions and alternate pathway agents are the current primary treatments , but they frequently fail to prohibit brain damage . Orthotopic liver transplantation cures the hyperammonemia of urea cycle disorders , but organ availability is limited and the procedure is highly invasive and requires life-long immunosuppression . A drug that could repair or stimulate a dysfunctional urea cycle such as this would have several advantages over current therapy . A drug called N-carbamyl-L-glutamate , Carglumic acid ( NCG or Carbaglu ) has recently been found to be virtually curative of another urea cycle defect called NAGS deficiency . In this disorder , treatment with NCG alone normalizes ureagenesis , blood ammonia and glutamine levels , allows normal protein tolerance and restores health . Knowledge from this study is being applied to acquired hyperammonemia , specifically in patients with propionic PA and MMA , to try and improve neurodevelopmental outcomes by improving the hyperammonemia . Aims : The overall objective of this project is to determine whether treatment of acute hyperammonemia with Carglumic acid in propionic acidemia ( PA ) , methylmalonic acidemia ( MMA ) changes the long-term outcome of disease and to determine if it is effective in restoring urine ammonia levels to normal levels .","Methods/Design This 5-year , Phase II , double-blind study aims to recruit and enroll 34 PA and MMA patients during acute episodes of hyperammonemia . The primary aim is to circumvent the long-term neurodevelopmental decline due to having a prolonged levels of ammonia during crisis in the blood and urine . After treatment and crisis resolution with Carbaglu or placebo and standard of care therapy , measures of neurodevelopmental outcomes ( Bayley II and Functional Status Scale ) are being measured at 9 , 15,21 and 30 months post-discharge from the hospital . Safety of NCG treatment will also be monitored as measured by close examination of adverse events and laboratory blood tests . To test for the effectiveness of NCG , longitudinal models to evaluate the groupwise difference ( NCG vs . Placebo ) in the trajectory of change in neurodevelopmental outcomes and safety analyses between drug and placebo patients . Subsequent Episodes At any time after the initial episode , participants may present to the hospital with PA- or MMA-associated symptoms . If the plasma ammonia level verified as a bonafide episode of HA ( plasma ammonia is ≥ 100 µmol/l ) , that participant will receive the same study medication that they received during their initial episode in a double-blinded fashion , ( i.e . If the participant received NCG at the time of initial randomization , he/she will continue to receive NCG at each subsequent HA episode . If the participant received PLBO at the time of initial randomization , he/she will continue to receive PLBO at each subsequent HA episode ) . Only the pharmacist will know if the participant receives NCG or PLBO . The same study assessments ( previously stated ) will be conducted at each qualifying HSA episode .",2012-05-10,"March 15, 2017","Inclusion Criteria Aged 4 weeks or younger ( 0-28 days ) > 36 weeks gestational age at birth Birth weight ≥2500 g Plasma ammonia level at presentation > 150 mcmol/L PA or MMA presumed or established diagnosis as follows ( one of the following ) : Acidosis at presentation , pH 4 mcmol/L OR Diagnosed , or sibling diagnosed with PA by semi-quantitative urine organic acid analysis , defined as presence of elevated methylcitric acid and no evidence of biotin related disorders in the organic acid analysis OR Diagnosed , or sibling diagnosed with MMA by semi-quantitative urine organic acid analysis , defined as elevation of methylmalonic acid and no evidence of vitamin B12 dependent disorder on plasma amino acid analysis Able to receive medications orally , by nasogastric ( NG ) -tube or by gastric ( G ) -tube No concomitant illness which would preclude safe participation as judged by the investigator Signed informed consent by the subject 's legally acceptable representative After initial enrollment , criteria 3 or 4 ( definitive diagnosis of the patient ) must be fulfilled prior to discharge from initial admission in order to remain in the study .

AOSpine North America Research Network,NCT01597518,Riluzole in Spinal Cord Injury Study,AOSpine North America Research Network,2,0,Spinal Cord Injury,Drug,Riluzole,Treatment,Double,"The aim of this study is to evaluate efficacy and safety of riluzole in the treatment of patients with acute SCI . The primary objective is to evaluate the superiority of riluzole , at a dose of 2 x 100 mg the first 24 hours followed by 2 x 50 mg for the following 13 days after injury , as compared to placebo , in change between 180 days and baseline in motor outcomes as measured by International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury Examination ( ISNCSCI ) Motor Score , in patients with acute traumatic SCI , presenting to the hospital less than 12 hours after injury . Secondary objectives are to evaluate the effects of riluzole on overall neurologic recovery , sensory recovery , functional outcomes , quality of life outcomes , health utilities , mortality , and adverse events . The working hypothesis is that the riluzole treated subjects will experience superior motor , sensory , functional , and quality of life outcomes as compared to those receiving placebo , with an acceptable safety profile .","At present there are over 1 million people living with Spinal Cord Injury ( SCI ) in North America alone , with annual costs for the acute treatment and chronic care of these patients totaling four billion dollars USD . The worldwide prevalence of SCI is unknown , with estimates ranging up to 250 million individuals . The incidence of SCI in developed countries has been estimated to be between 10 - 40 cases per million inhabitants . In spite of the immense impact of SCI at a personal and societal level , an effective and safe pharmacologic treatment for SCI , shown to improve neurological and functional outcomes at long-term follow-up , remains absent . The final degree of neurological tissue destruction that occurs after traumatic SCI is a product of both primary and secondary injury mechanisms . The primary mechanical injury to the cord initiates a subsequent signaling cascade of deleterious down-stream events , known collectively as secondary injury mechanisms . These secondary injury mechanisms include ischemia , interstitial and cellular ionic imbalance , free radical formation , glutamatergic excitotoxicity , lipid peroxidation and generation of arachidonic acid metabolites . Although little can be done from a therapeutic standpoint to correct damage sustained during the primary injury , by mitigating the evolution of secondary injury events there is opportunity to preserve remnant viable neurological tissue and improve neurologic outcomes . There is convincing evidence from the preclinical realm that the pharmacologic agent riluzole attenuates certain aspects of the secondary injury cascade leading to diminished neurological tissue destruction in animal SCI models . Riluzole , a sodium channel blocking benzothiazole anticonvulsant , specifically exerts its neuroprotective effect by helping to maintain neuronal cellular ionic balance and by reducing the release of excitotoxic glutamate in the post-SCI setting . Several preclinical studies in the rodent SCI model have associated administration of riluzole with increased neural tissue preservation at the site of injury , in addition to improved behavioral outcomes , in comparison to administration of placebo or other sodium channel blocking drugs . In the clinical realm , while riluzole has not been studied extensively in the context of SCI , it has been widely used in the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) . A 2007 Cochrane review , summarizing the findings of 4 placebo-controlled randomized trials , concluded that at a dose of 100 mg daily , riluzole is safe and improves median survival by 2-3 months in patients with ALS . In regards to adverse events ( AEs ) , riluzole was well tolerated , although treated patients were 2.6 times more likely to experience a three-fold increase in serum alanine transaminase ( ALT ) as compared to patients treated with placebo . However , this effect was found to be uniformly reversible with cessation of riluzole therapy and was only reported after several months of medication administration . Recently , the clinical safety and pharmacokinetic profile of riluzole have been studied in a multi-center pilot study in the context of traumatic SCI . A total of 36 patients received an oral dose of riluzole 50 mg twice daily for 2 weeks , with treatment initiated within 12 hours of injury for all patients . The 12 hour dosing window , as well as the 2 week duration of therapy , was chosen to match the period of medication administration to the known period of glutamatergic excitotoxicity after SCI ( several minutes after injury until 2 weeks after injury ) . With the final analysis currently undergoing peer review , completion of this study has confirmed the acceptable safety profile of riluzole administration previously documented in the ALS literature , and has established the feasibility of conducting a large-scale efficacy trial investigating this therapy . At present , there is no specific pharmacological therapy that is given uniformly to all patients with traumatic SCI . As a result , a placebo-controlled comparison group is ethical and justifiable . The aim of the current trial is to evaluate efficacy and safety of riluzole in the treatment of patients with acute SCI . The primary objective of the current Phase II/III trial is to evaluate the superiority of riluzole , at a dose of 2 x 100 mg the first 24 hours followed by 2 x 50 mg for the following 13 days after injury , as compared to placebo , in change between 180 days and baseline in motor outcomes as measured by International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury Examination ( ISNCSCI ) Motor Score , in patients with acute traumatic SCI , presenting to the hospital less than 12 hours after injury .

People with schizophrenia are more likely than healthy people to abuse cannabis . Cannabis use may worsen clinical outcomes in this group , making the identification of pharmacotherapy to treat cannabis dependence in those with schizophrenia important . The investigators intend to test the combination of dronabinol , a cannabinoid agonist , and the α2-adrenergic agonist clonidine , for cannabis dependence in subjects with schizophrenia . The combination of dronabinol and clonidine may alleviate cannabis withdrawal symptoms while allowing treatment-seeking outpatients to benefit from medical management ( MM ) sessions when they are trying to stop using cannabis .

"Rigshospitalet, Denmark",NCT01592526,Autonomic Nervous Activity During the Systemic Inflammatory Response in Trained and Untrained Healthy Volunteers,"Rigshospitalet, Denmark",0,1,Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome,Other,Endotoxin,Basic Science,,"Critical illness , severe infection , extensive trauma or tissue damage cause an inflammatory ( irritative ) reaction in the body . This reaction affects the whole body and causes malaise , circulatory and cardiac changes , fever , increases the number of white blood cells in the blood stream and prompts release of signaling proteins . This reaction contributes to the development of considerable organ damage and possibly organ failure . These are serious complications in critical illness which are associated with a high mortality . This inflammatory reaction is affected by the autonomic nervous system . This is the part of the nervous system , which is beyond the control of the free will , and the part that regulates circulation , breathing and digestive functions . The autonomic nervous system works via so-called sympathetic signals , which set the body in a state of alertness to overcome immediate challenges , and parasympathetic ( vagal ) signals , which are especially active during restitution and rest . It is known , that the balanced activity in the autonomic nervous system affects the body 's inflammatory response in critical illness . A study in mice has shown that if parasympathetic ( vagal ) signals are blocked mortality in critical illness is increased . Reversely , when the autonomic nervous system is medically stimulated towards parasympathetic signaling , the magnitude of the inflammatory response is decreased . Nicotine exerts this stimulatory effect . Also , we know that individuals in good physical shape have increased parasympathetic tone compared to less trained individuals . However , studies have never addressed whether this shifted balance in the autonomic nervous system affects the inflammatory response related to critical illness . Over the last 30 years an experimental model mimicking the inflammatory response has been used in studies . Inflammation may be simulated by injecting the drug E.Coli LPS , which induces a controlled , fully reversible , harmless reaction the duration of which is a few hours . Influenza-like symptoms occur and changes in circulatory parameters and concentrations of signaling proteins can be measured . Using this experimental model , the investigators wish to study whether this shifted balance in the autonomic nervous system in individuals in good physical shape affects the body 's reaction to critical illness . Investigators also want to determine how nicotine ( using a nicotine patch ) affects this reaction .","Aim The investigators wish to study the inflammatory response in very well-trained and relatively untrained healthy volunteers using the human endotoxemia model . Also , the investigators wish to study the effect on nicotine on the inflammatory response .. Background Systemic inflammation and the endotoxin model Inflammation is the organisms response to invasion of microorganisms , trauma , endogenic or exogenic tissue damage . Systemic inflammation is a generalized response which affects the entire organism and presents with symptoms ( malaise , shivering , dizziness , nausea ) , clinical manifestations ( fever , tachypnea and hypocapnia , tachycardia ) and biochemical findings such as altered numbers and relative composition of leucocytes in blood and increased concentrations of acute phase reactants and cytokines . Systemic inflammation , activated cascades and microcirculatory disruptions are considered important pathogenic elements ind the development of organ dysfunction , which is a frequent and serious complication to critical illness regardless of the underlying cause . Over the last 30 years the human endotoxemia model has been us as an experimental platform for studies of systemic inflammation . Since the year 1998 studies using this model have been conducted at Center for Inflammation and Metabolism ( CIM ) , Rigshospitalet , Copenhagen University Hospital . An IV-bolus or infusion of E.Coli-lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , an isolated component of the outer cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria , also referred to as endotoxin , is administered to healthy volunteers . A dose-dependent , fully reversible response is evoked the duration of which is a few hours with flu-like symptoms and production of pro- and anti-inflammatory markers , e.g tumor-necrosis-factor-α ( TNF ) , interleukin ( IL ) -1β , IL-6 , IL-1ra and IL-10 . Serious adverse events have not been observed . The model is no accurate replication of acute infection , sepsis or other critical illness , however , evokes a reproducible , inter-individually comparable and fully reversible inflammatory response , which allows experimental studies of early stages of acute systemic inflammation and the interplay between different aspects of critical illness complicated by systemic inflammation . The autonomic nervous system and the inflammatory response Activity in the autonomic nervous system affects the inflammatory response . Vagal stimulation inhibits release of pro-inflammatory cytokines , TNF-α , IL-1 , IL-6 and high mobility group box protein-1 ( HMGB-1 ) , from macrophages activated by endotoxin , however , does not inhibit anti-inflammatory IL-10 . Cytologic studies document , that this effect is mediated via the nicotinergic α7-subtype acetylcholine-receptor ( α7nAchR ) . In a murine model peripheral vagal stimulation in vivo decreased mortality in endotoxemia and sepsis by cecal ligation . Kox et al found , that GTS-21 - a specific α7nAchR-agonist - was not generally associated with an altered inflammatory response in human endotoxemia , however , identified negative correlation between plasma concentrations of GTS-21 in the intervention group and maximal TNF-concentration . In another study , transdermally administered nicotine in healthy volunteers reduced the clinical , inflammatory response with reduced changes in body temperature and heart rate and increased plasma concentrations of cortisol and the anti-inflammatory IL-10 . No differences in TNF-α , IL-1 or IL-6 expression were detected . Heart rate variability Heart rate variability ( HRV ) is the variation in the interval between successive heart beats over time . It is a well-described phenomenon and is believed to reflect the cardiac balance of sympathetic- and vagal activity , thus changes in HRV may be interpreted as an indirect marker of changes in autonomic nervous activity . Physiological or pathological changes in autonomic nervous activity can be observed with performance of a standardized valsalva maneuver while monitoring blood pressure , heart rate and subsequent calculation of HRV and blood pressure variability . Reduced HRV is present in critical illness and is believed to reflect a shift in autonomic nervous balance towards increased sympathetic activity and vagal withdrawal . This phenomenon is a well documented predictor for poor outcome . Equally , reduced heart rate variability is observed in human endotoxemia in healthy volunteers . However , the magnitude of this reduction in HRV does not correspond to the severity of the inflammatory response as determined by plasma concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines . Individuals in excellent training status present altered activity in the autonomic nervous system with increased vagal activity with a low resting heart rate and increased HRV . Whether this altered autonomic activity still presents during critical illness is unknown , but it is a possibility that certain positive effects of physical activity may in part be due increased vagal activity and alterations in the systemic inflammatory response mediated by the vagal activity . Exercise and the inflammatory response No previous in vivo studies address the impact of increased vagal activity in well-trained individuals on the inflammatory response in comparison to that seen in untrained individuals . In the above mentioned study by Jan et al analysis of baseline HRV found that and HRV component traditionally considered proportional to sympathetic activity ( LF/HF ) correlated inversely with maximal TNF-α concentration in plasma . Furthermore , this study finds that heart rate at baseline does not correlate to HRV characteristics neither at baseline nor during endotoxemia . However , physical training condition of the participants is not reported . Likewise , no mention of physical training status is made in the before mentioned studies concerning experimental use of nicotinergic agonist in endotoxemia ( transdermally administered nicotine29 or orally administered GTS-21 ) . Two in vitro trials perform whole blood stimulation with LPS and find that baseline HRV is inversely proportional to TNF and IL-6 production , and inflammatory response in vitro is reduced in previously untrained individuals after a period of regular aerobic exercise . No in vivo studies addressing this have been conducted . The investigators aim to study the inflammatory response in endotoxemia in well-trained and untrained healthy volunteers and determine whether transdermally administered nicotine alters this response . A cross-over study design is applied so that volunteers act as their own control . This increases the chances of demonstrating a statistically significant effect . Due to risk of LPS-tolerance the two study days need to be at least 4 weeks apart . Hypotheses Healthy well-trained individuals produce a reduced inflammatory response during experimental endotoxemia compared to untrained individuals . Healthy , well-trained individuals display an increased HRV at baseline and experience a smaller reduction in HRV during endotoxemia compared to untrained individuals . Transdermally administered nicotine during endotoxemia reduces clinical and preclinical features of the inflammatory response during endotoxemia in well-trained as well as untrained individuals . Endotoxemia induces a transitory state of hyperalgesia in well-trained as well as untrained volunteers .",2012-05-02,"January 28, 2016",Inclusion Criteria : Male Age 18-35 years BMI 60 ml/kg/min Untrained ( N = 12 ) : VO2max < 47 ml/kg/min Exclusion Criteria : Daily medicine intake ( excl . antihistamines during pollen season ) Smoking or use of nicotine substitutes Previous allergic reaction to nicotine pads Previous splenectomy,23,1,18 Years,35 Years

Medical University of Graz,NCT01595893,Vitamin D Supplementation in Polymorphic Light Eruption,Medical University of Graz,3,0,Polymorphic Light Eruption,Drug,Oral Vitamin D 3,Prevention,Triple,"Polymorphic light eruption ( PLE ) is a common photodermatosis with a high prevalence of approximately 11 to 21 % in the population . Similar to lupus erythematosus ( LE ) , an UV-inducible systemic autoimmune disease , PLE has a female preponderance with a mean onset in the second to third decade of life . PLE lesions are very itchy and typically appear on sun-exposed body sites in spring or early summer . The quality of life in patients with PLE is often severely disturbed , as evidenced by high levels of anxiety and depression . For prophylaxis besides conventional sunscreens , photo ( chemo ) therapy is effective in many cases , when administered over several weeks for hardening in early spring before the first natural sun exposure takes place . However , because prolonged treatment with UVB and/or photochemotherapy is potentially carcinogenic , the search for pathogenic mechanisms and new treatment options in PLE is ongoing . The exact pathogenesis of PLE is currently unknown but findings suggest an autoimmune-type background with resistance to UV-induced immune suppression and simultaneous immune reactions against skin photo-neoantigens . The investigators have recently found that PLE patients had significantly reduced 1,25- ( OH ) 2-vitamin D3 serum levels ( 13-14ng/ml ) compared to the normal population ( > 30ng/ml ) . In addition , the investigators were able to demonstrate in an intra-individual half-body trial that topical administration of an immunostimulatory 1,25- ( OH ) 2-vitamin-D3 analogue calcipotriol reduced PLE symptoms in an experimental study . In the proposed randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled trial the investigators attempt to study the effect of oral vitamin D3 supplementation ( 2 x 40.000 IE , given orally two weeks apart ) on PLE symptoms .","PLE patients will be subjected to experimental photo provocation with solar simulated UV radiation over several days before and after vitamin D3 supplementation . Disease symptoms will be quantified with a newly established and validated PLE test score , ( AA + SI + 0.4P [ range , 0-12 ] , where AA is affected area score [ range , 0-4 ] , SI is skin infiltration score [ range , 0-4 ] , and P is pruritus score on a visual analogue scale [ range , 0-10 ] ) .

University of Pittsburgh,NCT01715883,Sodium Nitrite in Lung Transplant Patients to Minimize the Risk of Pulmonary Graft Dysfunction,"Gladwin, Mark, MD",2,0,Primary Graft Dysfunction,Drug,Sodium Nitrite,Prevention,,"This is a Phase 2 observational nonrandomized pilot investigation to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Sodium Nitrite administration for the reduction of Primary Graft Dysfunction ( PGD ) in patients undergoing lung transplant . The study will enroll 8 subjects , undergoing lung transplant at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center ( UPMC ) .","While increasing numbers of patients with advanced lung disease are candidates for lung transplantation , the short- and long-term outcomes are severely compromised by graft dysfunction , primarily in the form of organ rejection . The earliest manifestation of lung allograft dysfunction , termed primary graft dysfunction ( PGD ) , represents a form of ischemia-reperfusion acute lung injury , and occurs in its severest form ( Grade 3 ) in from 10 to 35 % of lung transplant recipients 1-6 . PGD is the primary cause of early morbidity and mortality after transplantation and is strongly associated with the late development of chronic lung rejection or Bronchiolitis Obliterans Syndrome ( BOS . Early graft dysfunction contributes significantly to the suboptimal outcomes of lung transplantation and to the failure of lung transplant recipients to achieve five-year survival rates comparable to patients who receive other solid organs such as the heart and liver . The risk of PGD further limits the time that lungs can be stored ex-vivo , therefore restricting the pool of available donors . A critical advance in the prevention of both early and late lung allograft dysfunction will occur if PGD can be successfully prevented or minimized . In this study , the investigators propose to test the hypothesis that administration of Sodium Nitrite to donor lungs and lung transplant recipients at the time of transplantation will be safe and will reduce the incidence of grades 2 and 3 PGD , thereby improving clinical outcomes with minimal toxicity . Sodium Nitrite will be obtained from a commercial preparation ( Hope Pharmaceuticals ) and the UPMC Pharmacy will prepare the formulations , which will be infused at three time points . First it will be infused into the preservation solution bag at the time of organ procurement from the donor , then to the allograft at the time of transplantation , and finally as a direct infusion into the organ recipient . The investigators plan to enroll total of 8 subjects undergoing lung transplantation for this Phase 2 observational non-randomized pilot investigation to evaluate the safety , efficacy , and pharmacokinetics of Sodium Nitrite administration when administered to the procured lung and lung transplant recipient , for the prevention of Primary Graft Dysfunction ( PGD ) . It is anticipated that positive results from this trial lead to a larger clinical investigation of Sodium Nitrite administration directed at producing a reduction in PGD and perhaps secondary obliterative bronchiolitis ; and will potentially allow for extended organ storage , extended use of more marginal organs , and more effective use of Donation after Cardiac Death ( DCD ) organs which undergo combination of warm and cold ischemia for organ procurement .",2012-10-08,"July 5, 2018","Inclusion Criteria : Subjects undergoing lung transplantation .

Mansoura University,NCT01719705,Effects of Pregabalin on Post-cesarean Pain,Mansoura University,1,1,Uncomplicated Singleton Pregnancies,Drug,Placebo,Treatment,Quadruple,"Post-cesarean pain management is essential for early mobilization of the mother so that she becomes able to care of her newborn . There choices for postoperative analgesia include spinal , systemic , or both opioids , non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) , local anesthetic infiltrations of the wound , or transverse abdominis plane blocks , which are determined by drug availability , regional and individual preferences , resource limitations and financial considerations . The use of opioids is associated with adverse effects such as nausea , pruritus , sedation , and occasionally respiratory depression . Pregabalin is an anticonvulsant drug structurally related to the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma amino butyric acid , that exerts its action by binding to the α-2-δ subunit of the voltage-dependent calcium channel . It reduces the release of the excitatory neurotransmitters and inhibits the hyperalgesia and central sensitization . A recent meta-analysis demonstrated that pregabalin reduce the postoperative 24 hours cumulative opioid consumption and opioid-related adverse effects namely , vomiting and visual disturbances after surgery . Compared with the use of pregabalin doses lower than 300 mg , the use of doses higher than 300 mg even reduced opioid consumption by 35 % . It is not known if pregabalin is excreted in human milk . There is a case report on the extensive excretion of pregabalin in breast milk , but with low measured concentrations in infant as a consequence of maternal exposure during breast feeding . Food and Drug Administration recommends to discontinue nursing or to discontinue pregabalin in nursing mothers . Pre-delivery single exposure to pregabalin is expected to be safe for the newborns . Up to the authors ' best knowledge , this is the first clinical study on the efficacy and safety of the administration of pregabalin before cesarean delivery . We hypothesis that the preoperative administration of a single dose of pregabalin will improve the quality of postoperative analgesia after cesarean delivery . This placebo-controlled study aims to compare the effects of preoperative administrations of single oral doses of pregabalin 150 mg and 300 mg on the postoperative pain scores , cumulative patient controlled morphine consumptions , neonatal Apgar and neurologic and adaptive capacity scores ( NACS ) , and maternal and neonatal adverse effects in parturients scheduled to elective Cesarean delivery under spinal anesthesia .","An independent investigator who will not be involved in the study will instruct the patients preoperatively about the use of patient controlled analgesia and visual analogue scale to assess the severity of postoperative pain ( 0 mm for no pain and100 mm for worst imaginable pain ) . Anaesthetic management will be standardized . Oral ranitidine 150 mg and metoclopramide 10 mg will be given the night before and on the morning of surgery , with 0.3 mol/L sodium citrate 30 mL given 15 min before induction . Ninety minutes before surgery , subjects will be allocated randomly into three groups by drawing sequentially numbered sealed opaque envelopes containing a software-generated randomization code to the placebo ( n = 45 ) , pregabalin 150 mg ( n = 45 ) and the pregabalin 300 mg ( n = 45 ) groups . The placebo and pregabalin capsules look identical and will be prepared by a local pharmacy . An anaesthesiologist not otherwise involved in the study and who will be blinded to treatment regimen will provide perioperative care . An independent investigator will collect perioperative data . All staff in the operating room will be unaware of patient allocation group . Maternal monitoring will include electrocardiography , non-invasive blood pressure , and pulse oximetry . Left uterine displacement will be maintained . Spinal anesthesia will be performed in all cases in sitting position at L3-L4 or L4-L5 spaces with hyperbaric bupivacaine 0.5 % ( 12.5 mg ) and fentanyl 20 µg . After the umbilical cord is clamped , a 10 IU infusion of oxytocin in 500 mL of lactated Ringer 's solution will be infused . A paediatrician blinded to study group allocation will record Apgar scores at 1 and 5 min , umbilical cord blood gas analysis and NACS at 15 min , 2h , 24 and 48 h after delivery .

Postoperative nausea or vomiting will be treated with intravenous metoclopramide 10 mg as required . Statistical analysis : Based on a previous study,7 the mean postoperative cumulative morphine consumption at 24 h after caesarean delivery was 38 mg with a standard deviation of 14 mg. An a priori power analysis indicated that 45 subjects were required in each group to detect a 25 % reduction in the cumulative morphine consumption at 24 h after caesarean delivery , that was assumed to have a clinically significant effect , with a type-I error of 0.0167 ( 0.05/3 possible comparisons ) and a power of 90 % .

This study is unique as it will be the first randomized , doubleblind , crossover study with a placebo inhaler and budesonide/formoterol fumarate dihydrate as the intervention which will evaluate the effects on ventilatory mechanics through the use of OEP . The investigators plan to demonstrate that budesonide/formoterol fumarate dihydrate impacts dynamic hyperinflation which can be detected with OEP , and that budesonide/formoterol fumarate dihydrate may have an effect in the short term on exercise capacity during a constant load exercise test . The changes in ventilatory mechanics measured after budesonide/formoterol fumarate dihydrate by OEP will provide a unique evaluation of budesonide/formoterol fumarate dihydrate in a controlled setting also demonstrating the utility of OEP in evaluating of the effects of a medical treatment on hyperinflation in individuals with chronic obstructive lung disease ( COPD ) . Primary Objective/Hypothesis : Our objective is to measure baseline , post treatment and post exercise spirometry and evaluate exercise dynamic hyperinflation before and after treatment using OEP . The investigators hypothesize that budesonide/formoterol fumarate dihydrate will decrease dynamic hyperinflation as measured by OEP . Primary Endpoint : Our primary endpoint is the change in dynamic hyperinflation , specifically end expiratory volumes , dynamic lung volumes and diaphragmatic paradoxical breathing as measured by OEP . Secondary Objective : Our secondary objective is to evaluate duration of steady state exercise and exercise capacity before and after treatment . Our secondary hypothesis is that decreases in dynamic hyperinflation during exercise will lead to improvements in dyspnea with exercise , and allow for increases in exercise capacity . Secondary endpoint : Exercise time , change in Borg scale at rest vs. Borg scale at steady state vs. Borg at end exercise .","This study will be a prospective , randomized , double blind , crossover interventional design . The crossover allows for equality in number of subjects assigned to each treatment and for subjects to be their own controls . Baseline spirometry will be taken prior to exercise test . Subjects will be prepared for OEP . All exercise will take place on an electromagnetically braked cycle ergometer . Throughout the protocol heart rate , blood pressure , O2 saturation , ventilation , and metabolic data will be recorded . A modified exercise induced asthma protocol will be used . Unlike prior studies , ventilatory kinematics ( with isolated diaphragmatic function ) will be monitored throughout exercise using biomechanical motion analysis ( OEP ) . This OEP analysis involves compartmentalization of the chest into three sections ; 1 ) pulmonary rib cage , 2 ) diaphragmatic rib cage , and 3 ) abdomen to determine the contribution of each component to total lung volume . By measuring the percent contribution of compartment , we are able to better understand its impact on respiration . OEP will be able to quantify and assess the distortion effects of dynamic hyperinflation and obstruction . Twenty moderate to severe COPD patients will be recruited . Subjects will refrain from their usual inhaled medications for 24 hours prior to the testing session . All subjects will be asked to verify that this is acceptable with their pulmonologist prior to participation . Subjects will also be asked to have their short acting bronchodilators and other regular medications available to be taken if symptoms should occur .

Elisha Hospital,NCT01714648,Can GnRH Agonist Trigger Prevent Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome?,Elisha Hospital,4,0,Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome,Drug,Triptorelin 0.2 mg,Prevention,,"Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ( OHSS ) is a major complication of ovarian stimulation for IVF if hCG is used to trigger final oocyte maturation . The investigators propose that using GnRH agonist as a trigger will eliminate OHSS , even in high-risk patients .","Administration of hCG ( 10.000 or 5.000 IU ) is essential in IVF protocols to trigger final oocyte maturation after ovarian stimulation . In high responder patients with potential risk of developing OHSS , hCG is usually withheld and the treatment cycle is cancelled without obtaining ( cryopreserved ) embryos for replacement . An alternative approach to trigger final oocyte maturation is to administer a GnRH agonist instead of hCG . This method is not possible following a long GnRH agonist protocol which causes down-regulation of the GnRH receptor . However , following GnRH antagonist treatment the GnRH receptor remains receptive to competitive binding by a GnRH agonist . It has been well-described in earlier IVF trials that a bolus of GnRH agonist will displace the GnRH antagonist from the GnRH receptors in the pituitary inducing an endogenous LH ( and FSH ) surge resulting in the maturation of oocytes and good quality embryos . In addition , the risk of moderate-to-severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ( OHSS ) becomes minimal due to the rapid demise of the corpora lutea . Following luteolysis , fresh embryo transfer would require alternative luteal phase support to secure good clinical outcome . Alternatively , good quality embryos obtained after GnRH agonist triggering can be cryopreserved and replaced in following frozen-thawn embryo transfer ( FTET ) cycles . Thus , also eliminating late onset OHSS due to pregnancy .",2012-10-20,"August 3, 2015","Inclusion Criteria : A female patient who needs IVF to become pregnant . Regular menstrual cycle .

Northwestern University,NCT01659866,Antibiotic Prophylaxis for Transrectal Prostate Biopsy,Northwestern University,4,1,Infection,Drug,Ciprofloxacin,Treatment,,"This study is being conducted in men scheduled to undergo transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy ( TRUSP ) . Traditionally prior to prostate biopsy , an antibiotic , ciprofloxacin , has been given to men to prevent biopsy-related infections . In recent years as ciprofloxacin resistance has increased in the community , more and more men are becoming infected with ciprofloxacin-resistant bacteria after prostate biopsy . This study is being done to determine if obtaining rectal swab cultures and choosing antibiotics based on these culture results will result in fewer infectious complications than giving all men ciprofloxacin . The investigators will compare 2 groups : men whose rectal swabs do not show ciprofloxacin-resistant bacteria will receive ciprofloxacin prior to biopsy , and men whose swabs do show ciprofloxacin-resistant bacteria will receive alternative antibiotics based on their culture results . Our hypothesis is that these 2 groups will have equal numbers of post-biopsy infectious complications and both groups will have fewer infectious complications than a historical group who received empiric ciprofloxacin without the benefit of rectal swab culture results .","This study is a prospective , nonrandomized trial evaluating the efficacy of directed antimicrobial prophylaxis prior to transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy ( TRUSP ) compared with ciprofloxacin prophylaxis , the current standard of care .

All patients will be contacted by phone twice after their biopsies , at approximately 7 and 30 days , to detail post-procedure infectious complications including fever , urinary tract infection , bacteremia and sepsis . Subjects who experience infections will have additional information regarding the infectious complications and cost of therapy abstracted from their medical record .

Eltrombopag may help increase the number of platelets during chemotherapy and may help prevent the risk of bleeding . Phase I will study the side effects , best dose and platelet effects of eltrombopag when given with consolidation chemotherapy . After the maximum safe and tolerated dose and schedule is found in Phase I , the study will proceed to Phase II . Phase II will confirm the dose and schedule of eltrombopag identified in Phase I that can increase platelet counts in patients receiving consolidation therapy .","Consolidation chemotherapy with high dose cytarabine usually causes myelosuppression for 14 to 21 days after each treatment . Patients have low blood counts for days or weeks before the bone marrow resumes function . This may result in e.g. , hospitalization , treatment with antibiotics , and transfusions with blood and/or platelets . In addition , this may cause a delay in treatment and reduction in dose . To achieve the best outcome from treatment , dose reductions and delays in treatment must be avoided . The incidence and duration of decreased white blood cells ( neutropenia ) and neutropenic complications have been reduced by the use of growth colony stimulating factors . Additionally , the use of erythropoietin-stimulating factors has reduced anemia and the need for red blood cell transfusions . Thrombocytopenia remains an important limiting factor in administration of chemotherapy and maintaining dose intensity in some patients . Additionally , the risk of bleeding secondary to low platelet counts may increase sickness or even death in patients undergoing cancer treatment . Thrombopoietin ( TPO ) is the principal cytokine involved in the regulation of megakaryopoiesis and platelet production . Eltrombopag is an orally bioavailable , small molecule , TPO-receptor agonist that stimulates platelet production by a similar , but not identical , mechanism to endogenous TPO . Eltrombopag has been approved in the U.S. for the treatment of chronic Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura . Eltrombopag is also under development for other indications such as Hepatitis C Virus-associated thrombocytopenia , Myelodysplastic Syndrome/AML , and oncology related thrombocytopenias . This agent appears to possess many of the desirable properties for a treatment for chemotherapy induced thrombocytopenia , including oral administration . The Phase I portion of this study will be conducted using a dose escalation/de-escalation strategy for patients in either the first or second complete remission . Dose escalations are planned in the form of both acceleration of date of initiation of eltrombopag relative to the start of consolidation chemotherapy as well as increasing daily dosing . The Phase II portion will be conducted using the dose and schedule selected from the Phase I portion of the study for those patients in first complete remission . Patients will be used as their own controls , e.g. , a two-period two-treatment cross-over design . Patients will be randomly allocated 1:1 to one of two sequences . Patients randomized to Sequence A will receive eltrombopag with their first cycle of consolidation and placebo with Cycle 2 . Patients randomized to Sequence B will receive placebo with their first cycle of consolidation and eltrombopag with Cycle 2 . The treatment assignment will be blinded to the patient and all study/sponsor personnel . Patients will undergo blood sample collection for Thrombopoietin ( TPO ) / Erythropoietin ( EPO ) and pharmacokinetic analysis of eltrombopag in Phase I and pharmacokinetic analysis of eltrombopag in the Phase II portion of the study .",2012-07-31,"October 14, 2020","Inclusion Criteria : • Cytomorphologically documented diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) .

It can be difficult to treat with chemotherapy . One possible treatment combines chemotherapy with a stem cell transplant . To make this treatment more effective , researchers want to give another drug along with the transplant . This drug , carfilzomib , is often used to help treat plasma cell myeloma . However , it is not usually given along with the transplant . Researchers want to see if it is safe and effective to combine the stem cell transplant with carfilzomib , and if it improves the results of the transplant . Objectives : - To test the safety and effectiveness of carfilzomib given with stem cell transplant for plasma cell myeloma . Eligibility : - Individuals between 18 and 75 years of age who are having a stem cell transplant to treat plasma cell myeloma . Design : Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history . Blood and urine samples will be collected . Imaging studies and a bone marrow biopsy will also be performed . Participants will have their own stem cells collected for the transplant . The transplant will be performed according to the standard of care . All participants will receive carfilzomib on the first 2 days after transplant . The study doctors will determine the number of additional doses that they may have . Treatment will be monitored with frequent blood tests and imaging studies .","Background : Despite very significant progress in therapy for plasma cell myeloma ( PCM ) in the last decade , the disease remains mostly incurable . High-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation ( AHCT ) continues to be a critical component of early treatment for PCM , but it is clear that the disease is not eradicated by the present high-dose therapy strategy , while intensifying the preparative regimen has , to this day , resulted in either no improvement in disease control or increased toxicity . Carfilzomib ( CFZ ) is a newer proteasome inhibitor with increased activity and a safer toxicity profile than bortezomib in PCM . The favorable toxicity profile makes it a likely candidate for increasing anti-PCM drug exposure in the early post-AHCT period .

The unadjusted rates of 5 year overall survival are approximately 95 % , and remain among the highest of all childhood and adult malignancies . With many children and young adults surviving into advanced age , the impetus has been to develop less toxic yet equally effective treatments . One of the main approaches taken over the last 25 years to minimize long-term treatment toxicity has been to limit the amount and volume of radiation received by patients . This pilot study continues along those lines , attempting to further refine the delivery of radiation therapy ( RT ) in order to avoid one of the most notorious long-term side-effects : secondary breast cancer . Multiple studies investigating late toxicity in long-term survivors of pediatric Hodgkin 's Lymphoma have shown the risk of breast cancer in young females receiving mediastinal radiation to be 50 times greater than their age-matched counterparts . The Late Effects Study Group , with a median follow-up of 17 years , reported a breast cancer incidence of 16 % with a standardized incidence ratio of 55.5 ( Bhatia , Yasui et al . 2003 ) . Through utilization of breast-sparing proton therapy , we hope to provide young female patients with the benefits of radiation therapy while decreasing their risk of secondary breast cancer , thus increasing the therapeutic ratio . In a prior computer-based , in-silico , dose planning study , utilizing the most basic beam orientation ( a single PA beam ) , we showed that dose to breast tissue was reduced by a minimum of at least 80 % with proton treatment compared to standard AP-PA photon treatment ( in publication ) . Furthermore , dose to clinical target volume was maintained , and dose to other normal structures was statistically no worse . We now aim to validate these findings by verifying the beam range , in-vivo , via post-treatment combined Positron Emission Tomography-Computer Tomography ( PET-CT ) imaging in young females undergoing supra-diaphragmatic radiotherapy for Hodgkin 's Disease .",2012-04-19,"February 3, 2015",Inclusion Criteria : Female sex Age > /= 10 years old and 160 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure > 100 mm Hg on 2 consecutive measurements separated by 1 week ) .

It will also help answer the question , `` How does topiramate reduce drinking in teenagers ? '' Understanding how topiramate may reduce drinking in adolescents would allow for a more targeted pharmacotherapeutic approach to treatment and help to identify additional medications that may hold promise for improving treatment outcomes for youth .","Adolescent alcohol use is associated with myriad adverse legal , health , and educational consequences and contributes to the leading causes of mortality among youth . Yet despite the magnitude of this public health problem , treatment initiatives for youth remain inadequate . Given these data , the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism identified the critical need for medications development research for youth with the goal of identifying promising agents for which large-scale clinical trials are justified . The long-term goal of this research program is to improve pharmacotherapy for alcoholism . The major objective of this project is to address the urgent need for empirical data on medications that may benefit youth . For the past 10 years our research program has successfully paired human laboratory paradigms with ecological momentary assessment ( EMA ) , whereby research participants use handheld electronic diaries to monitor their drinking , craving , and sensitivity to alcohol in real time in their natural environment . Using this approach , we identified mechanisms by which medications act and patient characteristics that moderate these effects . The proposed study will test if and how topiramate ( TPM ) , an anticonvulsant shown to be efficacious for treating adults , reduces drinking in youth . To this end , we will randomize adolescent problem drinkers to TPM or placebo for 8 weeks , in combination with biweekly motivational enhancement therapy sessions , using a two-group , double-blind design . While at the target dose ( 200 mg/day ) youth will complete EMA in their natural environment . In addition , youth will complete alcohol cue reactivity assessments in the laboratory to test the effects of TPM on cue-elicited craving and physiological reactivity in a controlled environment . Youth will complete 6- and 12-month follow-up assessments to determine whether any benefits are sustained .

"Jan Medical, Inc.",NCT01643525,Study to Test Sensitivity and Specificity of Passive Wave Pressure Device in Determining Ischemic Stroke,"Jan Medical, Inc.",2,0,Ischemic Stroke,Device,Nautilus NeuroWaveTM System,Diagnostic,,That the Jan Medical Nautilus NeuroWaveTM system provides significantly higher sensitivity to hyper acute ischemic stroke than does CT .,"In spite of the fact that approximately 800,000 strokes are diagnosed in the United States each year , many physicians and patients have approached the management of stroke with a sense of futility . However , within the past 2 decades , following the advent of computerized tomography ( CT ) , medical interest has turned toward stroke and effective interventions to treat and prevent it have received attention . CT and/or magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) are the typical diagnostic tools used in the event of a stroke alert . These studies are done on an emergent or urgent basis , since , to be effective , treatments for ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke must be delivered soon after onset of the illness . In an effort to institute an appropriate therapeutic regime , laboratory and structural diagnostic studies are required to be done as rapidly as possible to determine pathological etiology , size , and location of concern . The speed at which a diagnosis is made and a treatment plan established often determines patient outcome and any associated complications . This is especially true when evaluating patients for ischemic stroke where there is a narrow 3 hour window of opportunity in which to resolve the clot with IV .before permanent neurological impairment results , and up to 8 additional hours with the use if intra arterial ( IA ) t-PA or interventional mechanical embolectomy procedures are utilized . Current treatment modalities include pharmacologic thrombolytic drugs utilized to disrupt or dissolve clots located in the distal vasculature or mechanical intervention in larger vessels . Since many patients do not recognize the symptoms of stroke they do not seek medical attention immediately . Significant time is then often lost from the onset of the stroke before seeking medical help / treatment . Although the current technologies are quite adequate as diagnostic tools for hemorrhagic stroke and for identifying subdural hematomas , and other pooled blood abnormalities which would preclude t-PA therapy , they are largely ineffective at positively identifying stroke during the limited therapeutic window of time . Positive identification of ischemia itself is rarely possible or practical with CT or within the limited therapeutic window .

Leiden University Medical Center,NCT01648998,Fludrocortisone and Information Processing in Healthy Volunteers,Leiden University Medical Center,1,1,Depression,Drug,Fludrocortisone,Treatment,Triple,"Stimulating the mineralocorticoid receptor ( MR ) may restore a disturbed balance as seen in depression . In this double-blind , randomized , placebo-controlled trial the investigators will test the effects of a single dose ( 500mg ) fludrocortisone , an MR-agonist , on the information processing in healthy female volunteers ( N = 2x20 ) . The investigators want to investigate whether the acute administration of fludrocortisone ( FC ) in healthy females enhances the appraisal of emotional information related to depression , hypothesizing that : FC relative to placebo selectively improves the recognition of happy and fearful faces : resulting in more correct responses and faster RTs . FC induces a bias towards more positive self-description and an improved memory for positive information . Female participants were selected because the haplotype MRI180V is related to depression vulnerability in women , not in men . If the effects of fludrocortisone are comparable to the effects of antidepressants on the same tests and the same population , it might be a first indication that fludrocortisone may function as an antidepressant .","We found in depressed individuals , compared with non-depressed controls , that MRs had a decreased ( approximately -30 % ) expression in hippocampus , inferior frontal gyrus and cingulate gyrus . It is proposed that decreased expression of MRs is part of the underlying pathological process in depression . Recent studies have revealed considerable interpersonal differences with regard to the functioning of the MRs. Firstly , common MR gene polymorphisms influence the cortisol awakening response ( CAR ) . Secondly , clinical populations differ in observed depressive symptoms as a function of MRI180V genotype . This MR I180V gene variant showed less activity in vitro , which suggests that functionality in vivo is decreased . Finally , MR haplotype 2 , which is prevalent in 35 % of the Caucasian population , enhances the transcription , translation and transactivation of the MR . This haplotype is associated with higher dispositional optimism , fewer thoughts of hopelessness and lower risk of major depression . These effects are restricted to pre-menopausal women . This suggests that female sex steroids may interact with the MR gene , thereby modulating resilience . Indeed , it has been shown that progesterone and oestrogen modulate MR-expression in rats . Taken together , mineralocorticoid receptors in the brain are considered to be a new target for the treatment of stress related disorders like depression . Fludrocortisone ( 9α fluoro-hydrocortisone ) ( FC ) is a specific MR-agonist currently used to treat diseases of the adrenal cortex , septic shock ( Russel , 2008 ) and occasionally orthostatic hypotension . It is shown that FC significantly inhibits nocturnal HPA axis activity without first depleting MR receptors with an MR-antagonist . This suggests FC have interesting implications in disorders of HPA axis excess , such as depression . Consistent with the idea that the stimulation of the MR might be useful in the treatment of depression , fludrocortisone accelerated the antidepressant effects of the SSRI escitalopram , at least in those patients who responded to escitalopram . This is in line with a previous observation that spironolactone , a MR antagonist , decreased the efficacy of the antidepressant amitriptyline in depressed patients . These studies show that stimulation of the MR might be a useful addition to the treatment of depression . Though , the explanatory mechanism behind these observations remains unclear . This project is a first step in investigating the potential antidepressant effects of MR stimulation by fludrocortisone . We will test the effects of FC on indices of emotional information processing in healthy volunteers , which is a recently validated model of antidepressant drug action . It has been demonstrated repeatedly that a single dose of an antidepressant changes the processing of emotionally relevant information in healthy volunteers , within a few hours after administration . For instance , one dose of citalopram improved the recognition of facial expressions of fear and happiness relative to placebo in healthy female volunteers . This finding has been replicated with different antidepressants and different populations .",2012-05-23,"February 23, 2014","Inclusion Criteria : Fluent in Dutch Age 18-35 yrs BMI 18 to 30 kg/m2 Northwestern European ancestry Exclusion Criteria : Known contra-indications for fludrocortisone use : Allergy to fludrocortisone .

It has been shown that a meal shortens the QT interval , which may affect pharmacokinetics ( PK ) and/or pharmacodynamics ( PD ) of the study drug . However , there is no published data clarifying this issue . There is also a paucity of data investigating ethnic differences of the effects of medicines on QTc . The aims of the study were to compare the effect of different food contents to placebo on the changes in ECG and to demonstrate the effect of insulin , C-peptide and glucose on the ECG . This was done by giving different treatments on separate days , which included intravenous insulin , a high carbohydrate breakfast [ > 70 % ] , and a calorie reduced low carbohydrate American FDA standard breakfast . Moxifloxacin 400 mg was used as a positive control and was given with and without food to Caucasian and Japanese volunteers to investigate racial differences .","This study was initially performed in 24 healthy Caucasian and Japanese volunteers with an option to increase the sample size to up to 54 volunteers . The decision to increase the sample size to 32 was based on the standard deviation of the ECG intervals observed in the first 24 volunteers . This analysis was performed by an independent statistician under blinded conditions . Each volunteer participated in 2 periods . Each period consisted of 1 baseline day ( D-1 ) followed by 3 study days ( D1 - D3 ) when the various food effect and drug treatments or placebo were administered . All volunteers received all treatments . Moxifloxacin was always given on D3 to prevent any carryover effect and there was a minimum washout period of 3 days in between the 2 periods . How well the treatments ( insulin/glucose , high carbohydrate breakfast , calorie reduced breakfast and moxifloxacin ) were tolerated by the volunteers was assessed and any side effects noted . We compared the effects of the various treatments between Caucasian and Japanese volunteers . Moxifloxacin and placebo were given to volunteers by mouth , i.e . they were asked to swallow them with water . The different types of breakfast were provided which volunteers were asked to eat .

It has been suggested treatment with a nutritional supplement , able to normalize the 'cardiac electrophysiology ' and help to maintain wellness . Ritmonutra ® is a combination of nutraceuticals® , including Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids , Hawthorn , Astaxanthin and Vitamin E , help to normalize the heart pacing , reducing the total number of benign extrasystoles and consequently improving the quality of life .","Benign supraventricular and ventricular extrasystoles may frequently occur in subjects free of a specific organic heart disease . use of potent anti-arrhythmic is not indicated for these kind of arrhythmias but the occurrence of this type of extrasystoles may generate concern in patients and consequently worse quality of life . Study Rationale Supraventricular and ventricular extrasystoles may frequently occur in subjects free of a specific organic heart disease . The prognosis of these arrhythmias is benign and the only clinical indication is to perform periodic medical examinations to confirm the absence of an organic heart disease during follow up . Treatment of these benign arrhythmias does n't required use of potent anti-arrhythmic drugs because of their potential side effects . However , the occurrence of this type of extrasystoles may generate concern in patients despite the assurances of the physician , and consequently worse quality of life . For these reasons it has been suggested treatment with a nutritional supplement , able to normalize the 'cardiac electrophysiology ' and help to maintain wellness . Ritmonutra ® is a combination of nutraceuticals with a demonstrated efficacy on preserving the physiological cardiovascular functions in addition to an adequate diet . Ritmonutra ® is classified by the Ministry of Health as a food supplement with Notification in 26 Settmbre 2011 . The functional components of Ritmonutra ® , including Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids , Hawthorn , Astaxanthin and Vitamin E , help to normalize the pace , reducing the total number of benign extrasystoles , and consequently improving the quality of life . According to preliminary studies performed in patients with benign extrasystoles , both supraventricular and ventricular , free of specific heart disease , Ritmonutra ® has been demonstrated to have a significant effect in reducing the number of total extrasystoles and in improving the wellness of the subject . In particular , Ritmonutra ® was shown to improve the social life of individuals and reduce the limitations caused by emotional state , without side effects . AIM OF THE STUDY Aim of the study is to investigate whether addition of Ritmonutra in addition to a adequate diet can improve and normalize the regular rhythm in patients free of specific organic cardiovascular disease compared to a mere placebo . Moreover , in patients with symptomatic benign extrasytoles , the investigators want to evaluate whether this nutraceutical supplement can reduce the discomfort related to perceiving these arrhythmias and consequently improve life quality . STUDY DESIGN multicentre , randomized , controlled parallel-group study . STUDY POPULATION The study will include participation of one clinic centre coordinating 150 general practitioners ( GPs ) . Each GP will select at least 10 subjects of both gender , All participants will give written informed consent to the protocol approved by the local institutional review boards . At least 150 doctors will take part in the study ; each will treat at least 10 subjects of both genders with diagnosis of symptomatic benign ventricular and supraventricular extrasytoles , free of specific organic cardiovascular disease and not requiring pharmacological therapy . Indicators : GPs are required : 1 ) to record a full medical history , including smoking and drinking habits , based on a pre-defined clinical record ; 2 ) to collect demographic and anthropometric measures ( height , weight , waist circumference at the iliac crest ) ; 3 ) to perform a complete physical exam . At the first visit and after 4 and 8 weeks all eligible patients will perform a complete physical exam that includes measure of office blood pressure and heart rate in the sitting position and in triplicate , using a manual sphygmomanometer , according to international guidelines . Measurements will be rounded to the closest 2 mmHg interval . The baseline visit and the others screening visits also include Electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , Ergometric test , Echocardiogram and Holter ECG . The primary endpoint is reduction of total number of extrasystoles . Secondary endpoint : the improvement in the wellness of the subject and consequently in the life quality . 4.1 . Sample size The estimate of the sample size was performed by the SISA method ( Simple Interactive Statistical Analysis ) - Machin , David and Campbell , Michael J . ( 1987 ) Statistical Tables for the Design of Clinical Trials . Blackwell Scientific Publications , Boston . Based on the values of a previous preliminary study comparing Ritmonutra ® with a control group ( -58.5 % reduction of total extrasystoles after 4 weeks with Ritmonutra ® compared with-0.5 % in the control group ) an approximate estimate was made of the number of observations necessary so that the two percentages are significant at the 5 % probability level : 12 subjects cases in each group . TREATMENTS All subjects will receive dietary counseling determined by the general practitioner depending on the subject 's clinical condition , in accordance with the instructions of the Coordinating Site . Centralized randomization will be used to assign subjects to one of the two study treatments , Inert Placebo - Vitamin B complex + diet or vitamin B complex - Ritmonutra ® + diet . How Ritmonutra will be taken : 2 tavgel gum daily of Ritmonutra ® or vitamin B complex 2 tablets chewing a day . Duration of treatment : Subjects in both groups will take the assigned treatment for 4 weeks . Ritmonutra ® contains : 720 mg of Fish Oil with Omega-3 , including 480 mg of EPA and 40 mg of DHA , Hawthorn ( extract from Crataegus mongyna ) 300 mg equivalent to 5.4 mg of vitexin , 4 mg of Astaxanthin and 36 mg of Vitamin E. EVALUATION CRITERIA At baseline , and after 4 and 8 weeks cardiovascular parameters ( blood pressure , heart rate , Holter ECG ) and the SF-36 quality of life questionnaire and the 4SQ_2011questionnaire investigating somatic symptoms related to stress will be assessed as well as the others clinical parameters necessary to evaluate the cardiovascular risk and changes in life quality . STUDY PROCEDURES Each doctor will initially be given a login and password allowing confidential and individual access to the website www.ritmonutra.net for data entry . In order to avoid sampling errors , the doctor will include in the study the first 10 consecutive subjects who meet the admission criteria ( see point 4 ) . The doctor will complete the appropriate form ( also available on the ritmonutra.net site ) insert information of the point 0 and will assign the subject to one of two regimens , Inert Placebo - Vitamin B complex + diet or vitamin B complex - Ritmonutra ® + diet , based on what has been determined by centralized randomization under the responsibility of Prof. Bruno Trimarco and delivery to the subject the treatment required for 4 weeks ( Ritmonutra ® or control ) . After four weeks all the subjects under go to Holter ECG , the SF-36 and 4SQ_2011 . After the first four weeks patients will receive the alternative treatment provided by randomization ( control - Ritmonutra ® ) . After another four weeks all the subjects underwent 24-Hour Holter ( ECG ) monitoring , the SF-36 and 4SQ_2011 . STATISTICAL ANALYSIS The statistical analysis of baseline homogeneity will be undertaken using the chi-square test and analysis of variance , if appropriate . The statistical analysis to assess the clinical efficacy will be based on a comparison between differences at the various time points versus the baseline obtained in the two treatment groups and will be conducted using the chi-square test and analysis of variance , where appropriate . The level of significance will be considered to be an Alfa = 0.05 ( type I error ) and the power level a beta = 0.90 ( type II error ) .

This antibody is a chimeric protein and consists to 30 % of mouse variable light and heavy chain and to 70 % of human constant heavy and light chain . Ch 14.18 has already been tested in stage 4 neuroblastoma patients in phase I/II clinical trials with encouraging response rates . Therefore , the European SIOP neuroblastoma group designed a Phase III protocol to test the efficacy of ch14.18 immunotherapy in a randomised trial . However , the ch14.18 antibody for this Phase III trial was recloned and produced in Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) cells in contrast to ch14.18 antibody used for previous clinical trials , which was produced in murine , non-secreting myeloma cells ( SP2/0 ) . Although the antibody-gene transfer into CHO and SP2/0 was done with exactly the same plasmid assuring an identical protein sequence , changes in the glycosylation of the final protein product may occur since the glycosylation pattern varies between different production cell lines . Glycosylation is important for the immunological effector function of the antibody and the pharmacokinetics in patients . Therefore , this change is considered to be a major change in production requiring the reassessment of the new product in a Phase I clinical trial . The primary objective of this trial is the re-evaluation of toxicity of the new ch14.18/CHO antibody . This is ultimately followed by the secondary objectives including the determination of pharmacokinetics and immunostimulation in patients receiving ch14.18/CHO therapy . This involves particularly the determination of activation of immune effector cells and complement during and after application of ch14.18/CHO . Subsequently , we will evaluate the clinical effect of this treatment on the course of the disease . The nature of this phase I trial is a bridging study for a medicinal product subjected to a major change in production according to the guidelines provided by the `` Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products '' ( CPMP ) of the `` European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products ( EMEA ) ( Document Number CPMP/BWP/3207/00 ) .",2012-10-08,"October 21, 2020","Inclusion Criteria : Patients must be = 27 % by Echocardiogram or ejection function of > 50 % by gated radionuclide study .

University of Michigan,NCT01708278,Beneficial Effects of Quercetin in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD),University of Michigan,1,1,Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease,Drug,Quercetin,Treatment,Triple,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) is a progressive disorder of the lung parenchyma and airways , which is the third-leading cause of death in the USA . Current therapies for COPD are only partially effective and may also have side effects . Although increasing evidence indicates that quercetin supplementation may be beneficial in treating COPD , key methodological issues have not been resolved . The overall objective of this study is to determine the dosage of quercetin supplementation , bioavailability of quercetin , safety , dose-response relationship and appropriate biomarkers which reflect clinical outcomes in patients with COPD that is necessary for conducting large clinical trials in this patient population .","In our preclinical study , we have demonstrated that 4 fold increase in plasma quercetin levels significantly decreased lung inflammation and prevented progression . Clinical studies in healthy volunteers 4 fold increase in plasma quercetin levels ( 0.22 to 1 µM ) could be achieved by supplementing with 500mg of quercetin/day . However , safety of quercetin supplementation and quercetin dose required to achieve 4 fold increases in plasma quercetin levels in 'at-high-risk ' COPD population is yet to be established . This study involves two phases ; the first phase examines the safety of quercetin supplementation in subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) and the second phase determines the efficacy of quercetin in COPD patients . In this study , we will enroll COPD patients with mild to moderate disease between the age group of 40 to 65 years . During the first phase , we will enroll a total of 9 patients to examine the tolerance and safety of three doses of quercetin ( 500 , 1000 and 2000 mg/day ) in a dose escalation manner . First cohort consisting of three subjects will receive placebo or 500 mg of quercetin per day for one week and the safety of quercetin supplementation will be assessed by monitoring adverse events and any changes in outcomes of blood test that include complete blood counts ( CBC ) and comprehensive metabolic panel prior to after supplementation . If this dose is safe and tolerated , second cohort of 3 subjects will receive placebo or 1000 mg of quercetin per day quercetin for one week and again safety will be assessed . If the dose is safely tolerated , the third cohort will receive either placebo or 2000 mg of quercetin per day for a week and the safety will be assessed . Having completed Phase I study at University of Michigan , we planned to do the Phase II efficacy study under separate NCT number . As of 2016 this phase II study has not begun . Based on the initial study , we plan to choose the highest quercetin dose tolerated with no adverse events and the dose ( 500 mg of quercetin per day ) that was found to increase plasma quercetin levels by 4 fold over baseline in healthy volunteers to examine the efficacy of quercetin in reducing inflammatory and oxidative stress markers and improving lung function in COPD subjects . In the second phase , we will enroll a total of 75 subjects and randomized into three arms ; placebo ( 15 subjects ) or one of the two doses of quercetin ( 30 subjects per arm ) . All enrolled subjects will be asked to avoid quercetin rich foods throughout the study period . One week after enrollment ( run-in ) , subjects will be either supplemented with either placebo or one of the two doses of quercetin for 4 weeks . All participants will be blinded for study agents . Plasma and sputum quercetin levels , lung function , and markers of oxidative stress and inflammation will be determined at the start of the study ( following run-in period ) , at the end of 4 weeks treatment period .

"University of Colorado, Denver",NCT01700426,"Enhancing Treatment of Iron Deficiency and Iron Deficiency Anemia With an Antioxidant, Vitamin E","University of Colorado, Denver",1,1,Iron Deficiency,Drug,Vitamin E,Treatment,Quadruple,"The study addresses treatment of iron deficiency , the most common nutritional deficiency that infants and young children encounter . With the knowledge that iron deficiency may irreversibly affect a baby 's long-term neurodevelopment and behavior , the investigators are offering free screening blood draws at Children 's Hospital Colorado to older babies and toddlers ( 9-24 months old ) . If their blood results indicate a serum ferritin of ≤ 15 micrograms/dL without the presence of an elevated C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , they will be invited to continue in the intervention portion of the study , where they will receive iron supplements as well as vitamin E ( or placebo ) for an eight week treatment period . The rationale for the study is to test whether addition of Vitamin E , an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent , improves the treatment response to supplemental iron .","Enhancing Treatment of Iron Deficiency and Iron Deficiency Anemia with an Antioxidant , Vitamin E Synopsis/Abstract Iron Deficiency ( ID ) and Iron Deficiency Anemia ( IDA ) are common in older breastfed infants and toddlers . Treatment of 3-6 mg iron/kg/day is recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics ( AAP ) , but this regimen often results in only modest changes in iron status , despite being a substantially higher dose ( relative to body weight ) than is commonly used for adults . We propose that high therapeutic doses of iron induce an inflammatory response , thus increasing hepatic synthesis of a critical regulator of iron absorption , hepcidin , which functions to limit iron absorption in the context of inflammation . In infants and toddlers found to have ID or IDA , we propose to evaluate the efficacy of the addition of Vitamin E to iron therapy compared with the same dose of iron alone . Our primary hypothesis is that in infants and toddlers with ID or IDA , 2 months of supplemental Vitamin E combined with therapeutic iron supplementation will be more efficacious than the same dose of iron alone . The study design is a randomized , double blind efficacy trial of 2 months of iron therapy ( 6 mg/kg/day ) with or without Vitamin E ( 18 mg/day ) , in infants and toddlers with ID or IDA from 9 to 24 months of age . Primary outcomes include biomarkers of iron status ( ferritin , hemoglobin , transferrin saturation , and transferrin receptor ) ; secondary outcomes include biomarkers of inflammation and oxidant stress . Subjects : We will screen older infants ( 9-12 months of age ) who were predominantly breastfed through at least the first 9 months of life , and toddlers ( 12-24 months of age ) who were breastfed and/or who have modest dietary iron intakes . Intervention : Sixty-eight subjects found to have ID or IDA will be consented and randomized to one of the two treatment regimens ( 34 subjects per group ) . Liquid supplement preparations of iron ( both groups ) , Vitamin E ( test ) and placebo ( control ) will be distributed by the research pharmacy at The Children 's Hospital.Children 's Hospital Colorado . Outcomes : Biomarkers of iron status , iron homeostasis , oxidant stress , and of systemic and intestinal inflammation will be repeated at the end of the intervention . If the hypotheses are supported , the findings would provide a simple and effective modification to enhance iron therapy , and to improve the balance between adequate iron uptake to meet physiologic needs and excessive iron intake and its potential adverse effects . I . Goals and objectives : The broad goal of this proposal is to improve the health and nutrition of young children by improving iron status of infants and toddlers who have developed iron deficiency ( ID ) or iron deficiency anemia ( IDA ) . The specific objective is to test an intervention proposed to enhance the efficacy , and minimize potential toxicity , of therapeutic iron for infants and young children who have a dietary iron deficiency . Iron deficiency is the most common micronutrient deficiency in the world and negatively impacts health in several ways 1 , 2 . ID and IDA contribute to stunting and impaired growth , increased behavioral problems , and delayed mental and motor development 3 , 4 , 5-7 . Studies have also shown that some of the behavioral and developmental consequences of ID and IDA in young children are not reversible with treatment 8 . Despite the fortification of infant and toddler foods in the United States , a significant number of children still develop ID or IDA 9 . Current treatment recommendations include a wide dosage range ( 3-6 mg/kg/day ) , which represents amounts that are higher than routine supplementation levels for adults ( typically equivalent to < 1 mg/kg/day ) , reflecting the challenge and imprecision of effective treatment for ID and IDA in children . Iron excess is not without risk , and studies in adults have shown local ( intestinal ) and systemic inflammatory changes within days of iron therapy initiation 10 , 11 . Recent advances in the understanding of the regulation of iron homeostasis and metabolism indicate that systemic inflammation induces a protein called hepcidin , which blocks the uptake of iron into the body12 , 13 . Thus , stimulation of inflammation by high dose iron supplements may actually counteract the intended beneficial effect of the increase in iron intake . Vitamin E is an essential nutrient that functions as an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent , and has been studied for many potentially beneficial facets of human health , including potential for protection against heart disease14 ; accelerated aging mediated through DNA damage ; and impaired immunity 15 . Research in adults giving antioxidants along with iron therapy was associated with reduced oxidative potential . In this study , a palm oil extract containing approximately 7 mg of Vitamin E was supplemented along with iron therapy and was associated with reduced fecal oxidation 16 Alpha-tocopherol is the most studied form of Vitamin E , and has been shown to decrease biomarkers of total body oxidative stress and inflammation 15 , 17 . We propose to accomplish our primary specific objective by testing the effect on treatment outcomes of administration of Vitamin E along with iron supplements . II . Hypotheses : Our central hypothesis is that in infants and toddlers with ID or IDA , 2 months of supplemental Vitamin E combined with therapeutic iron supplementation at 6 mg/kg/day will be more efficacious than the same dose of iron alone . The specific hypotheses to be tested by the intervention are : Hypothesis 1 : Subjects receiving both iron and vitamin E supplements will have significantly greater changes in serum ferritin ( reflecting greater improvement in their iron status ) , than subjects receiving iron alone after eight weeks of supplementation . Hypothesis 2 : Significantly more subjects receiving both iron and vitamin E supplements will have an improved iron status profile , including ferritin , transferrin saturation , and serum transferrin receptor , than subjects receiving iron alone . Hypothesis 3 Subjects receiving both iron and vitamin E supplements will have significantly lower levels of inflammatory and oxidant stress biomarkers than subjects receiving iron alone . Hypothesis 4 : ( exploratory ) : The exposure to two months of iron therapy will be associated with significantly altered intestinal bacterial profiles compared to baseline , and at the end of therapy , the placebo group will have a greater predominance of potentially pathogenic bacterial phyla .",2012-09-21,"March 25, 2014","Inclusion Criteria : Between 9-24 months of age Weighed 5.5 lbs or more at birth Born at 34 week gestation or more Exclusion Criteria : Consumed infant formula within the past 3 months Inflammatory bowel disease , cystic fibrosis , liver or kidney disease , cancer , HIV , primary immune deficiencies , anemia unrelated to iron status , chronic blood loss in stool , inherited disorders or iron status , or bleeding or coagulation disorders ) Previous diagnosis of iron deficiency or iron deficiency anemia Previous treatment of iron deficiency or iron deficiency anemia",44,0,9 Months,2 Years

Laval University,NCT01701934,Impact of Roflumilast on Visceral Adiposity and Metabolic Profile in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease,Laval University,2,0,Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease,Drug,Roflumilast,Treatment,Triple,The purpose of this study is to determine whether roflumilast can improve metabolic profile and reduce visceral adiposity in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) .,"Although underweight has been the traditional nutritional concern in patients with COPD , overweight and obesity are becoming important issues in this disease . In a rehabilitation study , investigators found that 66 % of patients with moderate to severe COPD were either overweight or obese according to the WHO obesity classification ( BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2 ) . Obesity and COPD being two frequent conditions , it is important to understand the nature of their interactions . Obesity , particularly in its visceral form is associated with a plethora of metabolic consequences that increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases . This would seem relevant to COPD which is in itself an important risk factor for cardiovascular diseases . The presence of obesity , particularly visceral obesity , may thus define in patients with COPD a clinical phenotype at high risk of cardiovascular diseases . In this context , it is relevant to note that the prevalence of metabolic syndrome is increased in COPD . Although fat distribution has not been precisely assessed in COPD studies , increased waist circumference is common in this disease suggesting that visceral obesity is part of the obesity syndrome seen in COPD . Given the relationship between COPD , obesity and the metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular diseases , it is tempting to suggest that visceral obesity is likely to be frequent in COPD ( as in the general population ) and that the profound metabolic and inflammatory perturbations associated with this form of overweight/obesity could play a central role in the link between COPD and cardiovascular diseases . Roflumilast , a Phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor , has been recently evaluated as an anti-inflammatory medication in patients with COPD . Roflumilast , alone or in combination with long-acting bronchodilators , provide modest but significant improvement in lung function along with reductions in the rate of exacerbation in patients with moderate to severe COPD . A very interesting observation that was made in these 12-month duration studies was that the use of roflumilast was associated with an average reduction in body weight of 2 kg that took place during the first 6 months of the trials and remained relatively stable throughout the rest of the trials . The mechanisms and the precise effects of roflumilast on body composition and adipose tissue distribution have not been studied in great detail . However , available data suggest that roflumilast induces a preferential loss in body fat mass in comparison to fat-free mass . It remains to be seen whether roflumilast specifically affects visceral versus subcutaneous adipose tissue . The improved insulin sensitivity reported in one study in the presence of an apparently trivial weight loss ( 0.7 kg compared to placebo ) may suggest that a selective loss of visceral adipose tissue may have been produced in response to roflumilast therapy . These observations , although not definitive , suggest that roflumilast could be used not only to treat the respiratory component of COPD but also to modulate the metabolic aspect of this disease including visceral adiposity , features of the metabolic syndrome and significant co-morbidities of COPD .",2012-10-03,"November 10, 2014",Inclusion Criteria : Gave an informed consent Forced expiratory volume in 1 second < 80 % predicted Forced expiratory volume in 1 second / Forced vital capacity < 70 % No exacerbation in the last 4 weeks Current or ex-smoker Smoking history of at least 10 pack/year Body mass index of at least 25 kg/m2 Waist circumference of at least 94 cm Fasting blood triglycerides of at least 1.7 mmol/L Exclusion Criteria : Any significant pulmonary pathology other than COPD Under oxygen therapy more than 12 hours per day More than 2 exacerbation episodes in the last 12 months The patient is currently participating to the active phase of a rehabilitation program Patient has been under roflumilast therapy prior to enrollment Unstable hypertriglyceridemia or hypercholesterolemia Under diabetes therapy ( hypoglycemic agent or insulin ) Cancer history in the last 5 years ( except basal cell carcinoma ) Moderate or severe hepatic impairment Used prednisone or systemic corticosteroids in the last 4 weeks,14,1,40 Years,80 Years
Lagos State University,NCT01703104,The Efficacy of Jobelyn (Sorghum Bicolor Extract)in the Treatment of Sickle Cell Anemia,Lagos State University,1,1,Sickle Cell Anemia,Drug,Paludrine + Folic Acid,Treatment,Single,The primary objective is to determine if there is a significant increase in the haematocrit value of patients on Jobelyn and standard therapy compared to those on standard therapy alone .,"Sickle cell anaemia is an inherited haemoglobinopathy caused by a point missense mutation ( GAG to GTG ) in the beta globin gene that resulted in the substitution of an acidic amino acid ( glutamic acid ) with a neutral and hydrophobic amino acid ( valine ) in the codon 6 of the beta globin chain . This genetic defect has a prevalence of 20 % to 40 % in Sub Saharan Africa , 7.8 % in African Americans and to a lesser extent in the Middle East , Mediterranean and India . The higher frequency in the sub Saharan Africa is thought to be due to the selective advantage the gene confers on the traits ( heterozygotes state ) in malaria zone . Nigeria is the most populous country in this region with about 24 % frequency of the mutant gene . The prevalence of sickle cell anaemia in Nigeria is about 20 per 1000 life births . This implies that Nigeria may have the highest burden of the disease in the world . The severity of sickle cell disease varies . The disease is more severe in patients with haemoglobin SS or haemoglobin S beta thalassaemia than in those with haemoglobin S beta+ thalassaemia or haemoglobin SC disease . The Arab - Indian haplotype produces a less severe disease than the African haplotype . Similarly , the coinheritance of one or two , alpha globin chain deletions or high fetal haemoglobin level in hereditary persistence of fetal haemoglobin are associated with mild disease , The severity is therefore higher in the Sub Saharan African sub region . However , the severity of the disease varies widely for unexplained reasons among patients with haemoglobin SS in this region . The beta S globin chain binds at the valine site with complementary hydrophobic effects on other beta globin chain . This triggers the formation of polymers of haemoglobin . The rate of polymerization is increased with increase in intracellular deoxy-haemoglobin . Factors that promote polymerisation are dehydration , acidosis , increase in the level of 2,3 diphosphoglycerate which may occur in infections . On the other hand , the association of haemoglobin 5 with other haemoglobin that have higher oxygen affinity-like haemoglobin F or haemoglobin A reduce the rate of polymerisation . The haemoglobin polymer forms a firm gel that damages the cellular membrane . The damaged membrane causes movement of potassium and water out of the cell thus leading to dehydration and more polymer formation . This damage also causes the negatively charged phosphatidylserine to move to the membrane surface and the red cell becomes deformed in shape , more rigid and more adherent to the vascular endothelium . The result of these are easy fragmentation of the membrane and extra vascular haemolysis , complement mediated lysis of the cell and intravascular haemolysis , shortened red cell survival to 4 to 25 days , trapping of rigid irreversible sickle cells in the post capillary venules which is promoted by leukocytosis , platelet activation and inflammatory cytokines . The release of intravascular haemoglobin mobs up nitric acid which has a vasodilatation effect . This aggravates the already deficient tissue perfusion . A vicious circle is formed that eventually leads to tissue hypoxia , sequestration of blood in organs with sinuses ( spleen , liver , lungs and the penis ) . There is also a chronic haemolytic anaemia with insufficient increase in the production of erythropoietin due to the fact that the beta S globin chain has a lower affinity for oxygen and therefore releases oxygen easily to the tissue . To further reduce erythropoiesis is the increase of inflammatory cytokines that inhibit haemopoiesis i.e interleukin 1 and tumor necrotic factor . On the other hand an increase in the red cell mass tends to increase vascular occlusion and ischemic crises . The ideal stable haematocrit for sickle cell disease is therefore between 24 % and 28 % . At this range of haematocrit , tissue hypoxia is minimized and painful crises are easier to control . Factors that precipitate crises are dehydration , infection , extreme heat or cold and physical or emotional stress . These factors are prevalent in our environment . Early detection and preventive measures are very important in the management of sickle cell disease . To enhance red cell production , patients are offered regular folic acid . To prevent malaria , prophylactic paludrine is given and infection is treated with appropriate antibiotic . Among the anti sickling drugs , hydroxyurea , an inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase , has been shown to decrease the rate of painful crises probably by reducing adhesion to the endothelium , increasing the proportion of fetal haemoglobin within the cell and reduction in the white blood cells and platelets . Other drugs on trial are butyrate compounds and analogues of azacytidine . Other modalities are blood transfusion , exchange blood transfusion , stem cell transplant and the possibility of gene therapy is realistic . These modalities are not without their side effects and high costs . A new drug added to the routine drugs might minimize tissue . Hypoxia , rate of sickling and haemolysis if the haematocrit is within the steady state range , white cells count are reduced and inflammatory cytokines are reduced . Available reports suggest that sickle cell erythrocytes are susceptible , to endogenous free radical mediated oxidative damage as indicated by marked increase in lipid peroxidation and superoxide dismutase level in haemoglobin SS patient . However there remain discrepancies in the status of anti oxidant enzymes and vitamins in the patients . Sorghum bicolor , a grain long used in Africa for its high nutritional value also exhibits strong antioxidant properties and antiinflammatory effects . The traditional preparation of Sorghum bicolor has an oxygen radical absorbance capacity ( ORAC ) OF 3,123 micro mole TE/g . This is much higher than other botanical preparations . Complementing the antioxidant properties , sorghum bicolor also exhibits anti inflammatory effects and demonstrated selective COX-2 inhibition , providing effective reduction in inflammation without residual side effects . Sorghum bicolor extract has been shown to increase the haematocrit and haemoglobin level and reduce the white cell count in trypanosome brucei brucei induced anaemia in experimental rabbits . These effects were conclusive within 49 days of experimentation . Animals sacrificed after the administration of lethal dose Jobelyn were shown to have congestion of the liver , kidneys and lungs . This might be as a result of direct effect on these organs or a sign of cardiotoxicity . However there is a wide therapeutic range . Jobelyn is the proprietary name for the product intended to treat sickle cell disease and it is currently marketed as a nutritional supplement . Jobelyn is marketed in 250mg capsules of Sorghum bicolor leaf extract . The product is widely marketed in many countries including Nigeria . Many of our sickle cell patients have been using it regularly for a long time without any report of adverse effect . The sorghum bicolor extract is expected to increase the haematocrit of ' sickle cell anaemia within a short time , to reduce leukocytosis during sickling and therefore reduce vascular occlusion and improve tissue perfusion . The selective effect on COX 2 and the moderation of inflammatory cytokines is expected to reduce painful crises and inhibition of haemopoiesis .",2012-10-03,"October 5, 2012",Inclusion Criteria : Male or female 14 to 45 years of age Haemoglobin SS Exclusion Criteria : Patients with chronic inflammatory disease like tuberculosis Patients with chronic viral hepatitis or positive for human immunodeficiency virus Patients with autoimmune disorders . . patients with other haemoglobinopathy Pregnancy or anticipated pregnancy .

In past decades , there is n't much improvement of the outcome and survival of advanced esophageal cancer due to the lack of effective chemotherapy agents . The traditional chemotherapy drugs include 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin and the combination of them results in a 25-35 % response rate in both first-line and palliative treatment . Paclitaxel plus cisplatin regiment is another promising treatment of esophageal cancer and have been proved effective in many studies . One of our previous study showed paclitaxel and cisplatin treatment resulted in encouraging response rate with manageable side-effects in 131 patients of advanced esophageal cancer . However , the toxicities of paclitaxel and cisplatin limit their combination in clinic . For example , the polyoxyethylene castor oil paclitaxel could induce acute hypersensitivity reactions and neurotoxicity . Cisplatin could result in dysfunction of kidney and neurotoxicity . In addition , most of esophageal cancer patients are age 65 to 70 . Many of them have simultaneously other diseases such as hypertension , diabetes , and chronic kidney disease which cause varying damages of renal function and limit the use of cisplatin in these patients . Therefore , it is urgent for doctors to seek an alternative of cisplatin in the combination chemotherapy treatment . Therefore , the investigators designed this randomized clinical trial in which a novel combination of S-1 with paclitaxel is used to treat advanced esophageal cancer patients in compare with paclitaxel/cisplatin and 5-FU/cisplatin treatment to explore its efficacy and toxicity . The investigators hope this study will provide some clues for the treatment of esophageal cancer patients .","Esophageal cancer is one of the common malignant tumors , especially in China and the annual incidence of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma is 260,000 with the motility of 210,000 . In western countries , the incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma ( esophageal - gastric junction carcinoma ) now dramatically increased than in the past . The pathological types of highest incidences are changing from esophageal squamous cell carcinoma ( Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma , ESCC ) to esophageal adenocarcinoma ( Esophageal adenocarcinoma , EAC ) whose incidence is about 60-70 % . But in Asia , esophageal squamous cell carcinoma is still the dominant pathological type , accounting for more than 95 % . The prognosis of esophageal cancer is very poor . About 50 % of patients have advanced disease at diagnosis and the natural course is only 6-8 months with a 5-year survival rate of 5-7 % . In addition , though some patients received surgical treatment , disease will recurrent and metastasis in nearly 90 % of the patients . For those patients in early stage ( T1 ) , there are still nearly 50 % of patients relapse within 5 years . Therefore , in recent years , doctors and researchers in different countries are continued to seek effective treatment to improve the quality of life of patients with esophageal cancer and prolong survival . In past decades , there is n't much improvement of the outcome and survival of advanced esophageal cancer due to the lack of effective chemotherapy agents . The traditional chemotherapy drugs to treat esophageal cancer include 5 - fluorouracil and cisplatin and the combination of them results in a 25-35 % response rate in both first-line and palliative treatment . And this combing is still the traditional chemotherapy regimens and wildly used in clinical studies to treat both esophageal gland , squamous cell carcinoma of the clinical study . Paclitaxel plus cisplatin regiment is another promising treatment of esophageal cancer and have been proved effective in a lot of studies . This combination has become a standard treatment of esophageal cancer , especially the esophageal squamous cell carcinoma . In one of our previous study , paclitaxel and cisplatin treatment showed encouraging clinical results with manageable side-effects in 131 patients of advanced esophageal cancer . These investigations have fully proved the efficacy and feasibility of the combination of paclitaxel with cisplatin regiment in the treatment of esophageal cancer . However , the lower solubility of paclitaxel limited its direct intravenous use . To solve this problem , the paclitaxel must inject with an addition of the surfactant polyoxyethylene castor oil . Polyoxyethylene castor oil paclitaxel could induce high incidence of acute hypersensitivity reactions , ie . severe allergic reactions , kidney damage , and neurotoxicity and cardiovascular toxicity which is characterized by axonal degeneration and demyelination . Though proper preventive treatment will greatly reduce the incidence of allergy , there are still a small number of patients have allergy reaction . As the investigators all know , the main adverse of cisplatin is the renal toxicity . The peak age of esophageal cancer patients are age 65 to 70 and many of them have simultaneously other diseases such as hypertension , diabetes , and chronic kidney disease which cause varying damages of renal function and limit the use of cisplatin in these patients . Therefore , it is urgent and crucial for doctors to seek an alternative of cisplatin in the combination chemotherapy treatment . There have n't well designed large scale clinical trials to evidence the non-platinum treatment in esophageal cancer . Therefore , the investigators designed this randomized clinical trial in which a novel combination of S-1 with paclitaxel is used to treat advanced esophageal cancer patients in compare with paclitaxel/cisplatin and 5-FU/cisplatin treatment to explore its efficacy and toxicity . The investigators hope this study will provide some clues for the treatment of esophageal cancer patients .",2012-10-04,"April 5, 2017","Inclusion Criteria : Patients who have histologically confirmed diagnosis of esophageal cancer without prior palliative treatment or an interval of at least 6 months from the last operation , adjuvant radiation therapy and adjuvant chemotherapy .

The aims are to evaluate an anticipated clinical response to Kuvan treatment including negative symptom and cognitive deficits , evaluate safety of Kuvan treatment for schizophrenic patients and evaluate the relationship of changes in plasma Kuvan levels and efficacy outcomes .","Tetrahydrobiopterin ( BH4 ) is a vital central nervous system ( CNS ) cofactor that maintains availability of amine neurotransmitters such as dopamine ( DA ) and serotonin ( 5HT ) , and stimulates and modulates the glutamatergic system . Dysregulation of these neurotransmitter systems has been implicated in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia ( SZ ) . A central role of BH4 in schizophrenia is further supported by a study finding a relative deficit of 32 % for SZ patients as compared to controls . The observed BH4 deficit is comparable to that reported for genetic BH4 deficiency disorders , supporting its characterization as having physiological significance . This highly significant finding , along with : a ) the known roles of BH4 in neurotransmitter maintenance , b ) dysregulation of CNS neurotransmitter synthesis observed in human BH4 deficiencies , c ) evidence that plasma biopterin levels are correlated with CNS biopterin levels , and d ) evidence that urinary biopterin excretion is not increased in SZ , all support our hypothesis that dysregulation of BH4 biosynthesis is involved in the pathophysiology of SZ . Moreover , additional data suggesting that mood stabilizer drugs can moderately increase levels of biopterin in patients with psychiatric disorders , and the reported efficacy of BH4 in pilot studies of neuropsychiatric disorders , suggest that alleviation of the schizophrenia BH4 deficit via treatment with synthetic BH4 supplement ( Sapropterin dihydrochloride or Kuvan ) , may give rise to an improvement of the symptoms of schizophrenia , including positive and negative symptoms as well as neurocognitive deficits .

Vanderbilt University Medical Center,NCT01701973,Effect of DPP4 Inhibition on Growth Hormone Secretion,Vanderbilt University,4,1,Obesity,Drug,Sitagliptin,Other,Double,"This study tests the following hypotheses : Aim 1 : Test the hypothesis that acute dipeptidyl peptidase 4 ( DPP4 ) inhibition with the currently available anti-diabetic drug , sitagliptin , will increase stimulated growth hormone ( GH ) secretion in healthy lean adults by decreasing the degradation of growth hormone releasing hormone ( GHRH ) . Aim 2 : Test the hypothesis that decreased degradation of GHRH during acute DPP4 inhibition will result in an increase in endothelium-dependent vasodilation mediated by GH and independent from GLP1 ( glucagon like peptide-1 ) in healthy lean adults . This study promises to provide novel data regarding how this increasingly used class of anti-diabetic drugs affects the pituitary GH axis and could affect blood vessel relaxation . Growth hormone levels are low in the setting of obesity and pre-diabetes . A further study may evaluate the effect of chronic DPP4 inhibitor therapy in a population of patients with obesity and pre-diabetes .","Growth hormone secretion is low in patients with obesity , insulin resistance , and hyperlipidemia . GH therapy in these populations and others has been limited by side effects which include hyperglycemia . Another strategy to increase GH secretion is to enhance pulsatile GH secretion by growth hormone releasing hormone . Growth hormone releasing hormone ( GHRH ) has a half life of 5 minutes due to its rapid inactivation by DPP4 . An alternative strategy to increase endogenous GH secretion is by inhibiting degradation of GHRH by DPP4 . DPP4 inhibitors are currently approved therapies for the treatment of hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus . They additionally cause blood vessel relaxation . We therefore propose to test the hypothesis that DPP4 inhibition simultaneously enhances GH secretion while improving blood glucoses and vascular function in patient populations with low GH and increased cardiovascular risk . These preliminary aims serve primarily as a novel `` proof of concept '' study to define the effect of acute pharmacologic DPPIV inhibition on stimulated GH secretion .",2012-10-03,"May 25, 2018","Inclusion Criteria : Age 18 to 40 years inclusive BMI ≤ 25 kg/m2 For female subjects : Status-post surgical sterilization , or If of child-bearing potential , utilization of a barrier method of birth control following negative serum pregnancy test at screening visit and on every study day Exclusion Criteria : Smoking Type 1 or Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus , as defined by a fasting glucose of 126 mg/dL or greater at the time of screening visit or the use of anti-diabetic medication Hypertension , as defined by an untreated seated systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) greater than 140 mmHg and/or an untreated diastolic blood pressure ( DBP ) greater than 90 mmHg at the time of screening visit or the use of anti-hypertensive medication History of reported or recorded hypoglycemia ( plasma glucose < 70 mg/dL ) Pregnancy and/or Breast-Feeding Use of any medication other than multivitamin , including use of transdermal as well as oral hormone replacement therapy or use of oral contraceptive therapy Anemia defined as hematocrit < 35 % at screening visit Cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease , including history of myocardial infarction , history of congestive heart failure , history of stroke Pulmonary Hypertension Abnormal thyroid hormone levels ( TSH ) at the time of screening visit Abnormal serum insulin like growth factor-1 ( IGF-1 ) at the time of screening visit Impaired renal function , defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) 2 X upper limit of normal range ) Treatment with an investigational drug in the 1 month preceding the study",44,0,18 Years,40 Years

It 's treatment and prevention may signify an elevated hospitalization cost and the exposure to the patient to adverse effects of drugs . The current clinical trial has as primary objective to prove the efficacy of chewing gum as a preventive measure of post-operative ileus in pediatric patients after gastrointestinal surgery through the determination of the time the patient takes to tolerate oral intake , pass flatus , present bowel movements and the time of hospital stay . Patients will be assigned either to the case group ( chewing gum + standard treatment ) or to the control group ( standard treatment ) , in both of them time from the end of surgery to the moment the patient presents first bowel movement , passes flatus , tolerates oral intake ( any type of food ) and is discharged from hospital ; will be measured in hours and then analyzed to determine the validity of these data .","Postoperative ileus is a relatively common condition seen in patients with gastrointestinal diseases requiring surgery . Treatment and prevention of this condition involves the use of several drugs and devices which increase the length of hospital stay , costs of treatment and morbidity . In the last years there have been several reports about the use of chewing gum as a preventive measure of postoperative ileus with positive results in the adult population . Most of these studies involve patients who underwent colectomy . In the bibliographic review the investigators found just one study developed specifically with pediatric patients . Results are very similar between the studies ; time to present first bowel movement , pass flatus and tolerate oral intake is decreased with statistically significant evidence , meanwhile , the length of hospital stay has been proved to be shortened in just a few studies . The primary objective in the investigators study is to demonstrate chewing gum can be a cheap and easy therapeutic strategy to reduce the length of hospital stay , by diminishing the incidence and time of postoperative ileus ( by the determination of the time patients take to tolerate oral intake , pass flatus and present bowel movements ) . The investigators study hypothesis is stated as follows : Use of chewing gum in pediatric patients after gastrointestinal surgery reduces the risk of post-operative ileus by decreasing the time the patient takes to tolerate oral intake , pass flatus and present bowel movements . Study Design Randomized Clinical Trial Prospective Experimental Patients will be assigned either to the case group ( chewing gum + standard treatment ) or to the control group ( standard treatment ) , in both of them time from the end of surgery to the moment the patient presents first bowel movement , passes flatus , tolerates oral intake ( any type of food ) and is discharged from hospital ; will be measured in hours and then analyzed to determine the validity of these data .

This type of therapy is called gene transfer . In this protocol , we are modifying the patients white blood cells with a retrovirus that has the gene for anti-mesothelin incorporated in the retrovirus . Objective : The purpose of this study is to determine a safe number of these cells to infuse and to see if these tumor fighting cells ( anti-mesothelin cells ) cause metastatic cancer tumors to shrink . Eligibility : - Adults age 18-70 with metastatic cancer expressing the mesothelin molecule . Design : Work up stage : Patients will be seen as an outpatient at the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) clinical Center and undergo a history and physical examination , scans , x-rays , lab tests , and other tests as needed Leukapheresis : If the patients meet all of the requirements for the study they will undergo leukapheresis to obtain white blood cells to make the anti-mesothelin cells . { Leukapheresis is a common procedure , which removes only the white blood cells from the patient . } Treatment : Once their cells have grown , the patients will be admitted to the hospital for the conditioning chemotherapy , the anti-mesothelin cells , and aldesleukin . They will stay in the hospital for about 4 weeks for the treatment . Follow up : Patients will return to the clinic for a physical exam , review of side effects , lab tests , and scans about every 1-3 months for the first year , and then every 6 months to 1 year as long as their tumors are shrinking . Follow up visits will take up to 2 days .","Background : We have constructed a single retroviral vector that contains a chimeric T cell receptor ( CAR ) that recognizes mesothelin , which can be used to mediate genetic transfer of this CAR with high efficiency ( > 50 % ) without the need to perform any selection . In co-cultures with mesothelin expressing cells , anti-mesothelin transduced T cells secreted significant amounts of interferon ( IFN ) -gamma with high specificity . Objectives : Primary Objectives : To evaluate the safety of the administration of anti-mesothelin CAR engineered peripheral blood lymphocytes in patients receiving a non- myeloablative conditioning regimen , and aldesleukin . Determine if the administration anti-mesothelin CAR engineered peripheral blood lymphocytes and aldesleukin to patients following a nonmyeloablative but lymphoid depleting preparative regimen will result in clinical tumor regression in patients with metastatic cancer .

These results for the first time demonstrate a link between EPO and renal function : By inhibiting proximal tubular reabsorption , which in turn results in rapid declines in GFR and renin/aldosterone levels , EPO may directly reduce the major oxygen consuming factor in the kidney . The expected result will be an increase of the oxygen tension in the environment of renal EPO producing cells , in this way initiating an appropriate signal for down-regulation of endogenous EPO synthesis when circulating levels of EPO are high . The aim of this project is to test this hypothesis by investigating the renal effects of rHuEPO in humans . In a double-blinded manner healthy subjects will be tested with placebo , or low-dose rHuEPO for two weeks , or high-dose rHuEPO for three days . Accurate sodium balance studies will be conducted together with renal clearance studies for measurements of renal plasma flow ( 131I-Hippuran clearance with renal venous sampling ) , GFR ( 51Cr-EDTA clearance ) and the segmentel tubular handling of sodium and water ( lithium clearance ) . EPO is the sole haematopoietic growth factor that is mainly produced in the kidneys and the project will provide new information about basic physiological issues regarding the association between renal function and the regulation of EPO synthesis .","The haematopoietic effect of EPO and rHuEPO has been known for five decades but still the exact mechanisms for regulation of EPO synthesis in the kidneys remain unclear . Recently , we confirmed our previous observation that rHuEPO in normal subjects produces arterial hypertension and a reduction in plasma volume . Moreover , the study delineated the time course of these changes : rHuEPO promptly , and before any changes in hematocrit , blood volumes and blood pressure can be detected , causes a down-regulation of the renin-aldosterone system , proximal tubular reabsorption and GFR . The effect of rHuEPO on arterial blood pressure has been demonstrated to occur independent of its haematopoietic effect and subsequent effect on blood viscosity . Recently , we reported that also short-time administration of very high doses of rHuEPO ( 30,000 IU/day for three days ) increases arterial blood pressure and the blood pressure response to exercise to a similar extent as prolonged , low-dose rHuEPO for three month . The exact mechanisms remains unclear , but may involve rHuEPO induced release of endothelin and inhibition of eNOS mediated production of NO . The early rHuEPO induced reduction of renin and aldosterone was not caused by changes in plasma and blood volumes . A fall in intravascular volume normally leads to the opposite effect due to a decreased NaCl load to the macula densa and an increased sympathetic stimulation of the juxtaglomerular apparatus . The link between administration of rHuEPO and the renin-angiotensinaldosterone system is interesting because the production of endogenous EPO is regulated by this system . Administration of angiotensin II in humans stimulates EPO synthesis and , conversely , inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme and angiotensin II receptors decrease the plasma concentration of endogenous EPO . In patients with type-1 diabetes , an inherent high activity of basal renin-angiotensin system ( in part governed by genetic factors ) was associated with higher levels of EPO compared to patients with a low activity of basal renin-angiotensin system . Our results suggest that rHuEPO may activate an opposite pathway so as to down-regulate the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system independent of changes in red blood cell mass , blood volumes and blood pressure . Our renal clearance data suggest that the rHuEPO-induced inhibition of the renin-aldosterone system is associated with a reduction of absolute proximal tubular reabsorption of fluid and a fall in GFR . Changes in end-proximal delivery of tubular fluid to the macula densa produce inverse changes in renin release and thus the suppression of plasma renin levels may be secondary to direct effects of rHuEPO on proximal tubular reabsorption . In addition , a decrease in proximal tubular reabsorption activates the tubuloglomerular feedback mechanism causing a parallel decrease in GFR . The exact molecular mechanisms for rHuEPO 's effect on the proximal tubule remain unknown but may involve inhanced release of renal endothelin-1 which in low doses attenuates sodium reabsorption in the proximal tubule . Tubular reabsorption of sodium is the main oxygen consuming process in the kidney and around 70 % of the filtered load is reabsorbed in the proximal tubule . By inhibiting proximal tubular reabsorption , which in turn results in rapid declines in GFR and renin/aldosterone levels , rHuEPO may directly reduce the major oxygen consuming factor in the kidney , reduce the filtered load , and decrease angiotensin II and aldosterone dependent reabsorption in more distal nephron segments . Thus , we suggest that the renal effects of rHuEPO may be part of a feedback system that serves to down-regulate the endogenous renal synthesis of EPO in the presence of high levels of circulating EPO . In support of such a feedback system , evidence exists to indicate that prolonged administration of rHuEPO results in a suppression of urinary excretion of endogenous EPO , and also the renal effects of rHuEPO fits well in the hypothesis advanced by Donnelly , arguing that the kidney operates as a 'critmeter ' to regulate the EPO synthesis and body haematocrit through the metabolic signal of renal tissue oxygen pressure . It has been suggested that the reduction in plasma volume induced by rHuEPO may be caused by the hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism leading to natriuresis . In our previous study we did not perform actual sodium balance studies . However , the renal sodium loss necessary to account for the observed decrease in plasma volume is small , and it is possible that the net effect of rHuEPO was to cause a negative sodium balance during the entire 28 days treatment period . Hypotheses rHuEPO decreases renal proximal tubular reabsorption , concentrations of renin and aldosterone , GFR , and overall renal perfusion . In subjects on a sodium-fixed diet , rHuEPO increases the sodium excretion causing a negative sodium balance . rHuEPO decreases renal oxygen consumption so as to augment oxygen tension at EPOproducing , interstitiel fibroblast-like cells in the juxtamedullary region . rHuEPO decreases renal synthesis and secretion of endogenous EPO .

Dilated Cardiomyopathy ( DCM ) is one of the leading causes of Heart Failure due to systolic dysfunction and at least 30 % of DCM are of familial/genetic origin , usually with autosomal dominant inheritance , and underlying genes and mutations are increasingly identified .

Expected results : If the hypothesis is confirmed , and as a consequence , the knowledge derived from basic research ( genes identification in DCM ) will be translated into clinical practice ( early identification of subjects at high risk of developing heart failure through predictive genetic testing ) with the development of new therapeutic management ( early ACEi ) that will help to decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with the disease .

Washington University School of Medicine,NCT01585129,Treatment Utility of Postpartum Antibiotics in Chorioamnionitis,Washington University School of Medicine,4,0,The Primary Outcome of This Study Will be the Rate of Endometritis,Drug,Postpartum Antibiotics,Treatment,Single,To determine if prophylactic postpartum antibiotics are required post-cesarean delivery for pregnancies with treated chorioamnionitis .,"Bacterial infection of the amniotic cavity , termed `` chorioamnionitis '' , is a major cause of perinatal mortality and maternal morbidity . Early administration of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy in the laboring patient with chorioamnionitis has both neonatal and maternal benefits . Less known is the ideal postpartum antibiotic regimen - or if postpartum antibiotics are even required at all - needed to decrease febrile morbidity . Current practice has seen a wide range of practice styles ranging from no treatment to antibiotic prophylaxis for up to 48 hours after delivery . If antibiotics are prescribed , there is good evidence to support one additional dose of antibiotics as compared to 24 hour dosing to decrease the rate of endometritis . Less clear is whether antibiotics are required at all for the properly treated patient with chorioamnionitis who requires a cesarean delivery . One study comparing continued antibiotics versus no-treatment failed to show a difference in the rate of postpartum endometritis . The conclusion from this study was that continuation of preoperative clindamycin and gentamicin in the postoperative period did not reduce the risk of endometritis compared to a single preoperative dose however this study was terminated early due to failure to recruit their stated sample size . Puerperal endometritis rates vary by mode of delivery but it is known that the rate is lower in vaginal deliveries as compared to cesarean delivery . The patient with chorioamnionitis that requires a cesarean delivery makes an excellent study target . Given the lack of studied protocols , there currently are many acceptable methods for treating the patient with chorioamnionitis . Our proposed study plans to evaluate the two most common methods of treatment to determine the most effective regimen . If post-delivery antibiotics do not show a benefit to these highest risk subjects , it is likely inferred that patients that undergo a vaginal delivery will not require antibiotics as well . Specific Aims There is conflicting data regarding the necessity of post-delivery antibiotics for patients with chorioamnionitis who undergo cesarean delivery .

Increased bowel frequency and urgency with rectal spasms and incontinence have deleterious impacts on quality of life in a third of the cases . One possible physiopathology hypothesis suggests an ongoing spastic process ; different mechanisms have been postulated . These include alteration of normal anorectal sensation with loss of the recto-anal inhibitory reflex ( RAIR ) , decreased rectal compliance and reduced rectal capacity as well as sphincter damage secondary to preoperative chemoradiation therapy or during surgery . Current available treatments are often ineffective , highlighting the need for more successful management .

To investigate this , we will perform a study comparing the efficacy of extra-fine particle HFA-QVAR 200 µg b.i.d . to an equipotent dose of course particle HFA-beclomethasone ( HFA-Clenil ) 400 µg b.i.d . and with coarse particle HFA-fluticasone ( GSK ) 250 µg in ex-smokers and smokers with asthma . Study design : This study will be an open-label , randomised , three-way cross-over , two-center study . 20 smokers and 20 ex-smokers with asthma will receive the following treatments for two weeks :","Rationale : Thus far , most clinical studies investigating the effects of inhaled corticosteroids ( ICS ) in asthma have concentrated on non-smoking asthmatics . However , a considerable proportion of asthma patients smokes . Cigarette smoke consists of ultra-fine particles with a diameter between 0.1 and 1 µm and therefore reaches even the smallest airways . In line with this , it has been reported that smoking is associated with small airways dysfunction . The latter may help to explain the observation that treatment with course particle inhaled corticosteroids is less effective in smokers with asthma . Recently , extra-fine particle aerosols such as hydrofluoroalkane-beclomethasone ( HFA-QVAR ) have become available for the treatment of asthma , which are more likely to reach the smaller airways . Based on the above , we hypothesize that extra-fine particle treatment with HFA-QVAR will be superior in improving small airways dysfunction , especially in ex-smokers and smokers with asthma .

NPC1 is a genetic disorder that results in gradual loss of nervous system function . Cholesterol and other fats have trouble moving out of the brain cells , which makes the cells work poorly and leads to symptoms . There is no treatment currently approved in the US for NPC1 . Researchers want to test if it is safe to use HPBCD for NPC1 . They want to see if it can help brain cells process cholesterol better . Objectives : - To test the safety and effectiveness of HPBCD for NPC1 . Eligibility : - Individuals between 2 and 25 years of age who have been diagnosed with NPC1 and who have not already received HPBCD in an attempt to treat NPC1 . Design : Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history . They will provide blood and urine samples for screening . They will also have neurological tests , including tests of hearing , speech and movement . Participants will have a lumbar puncture ( also called a spinal tap ) every month to deliver the drug to the spinal fluid that surrounds the brain . The length of the trial will be determined by the safety and efficacy information that is obtained . Treatment will be monitored with frequent blood and urine tests , cerebral spinal fluid tests , hearing and neurological exams .","Niemann-Pick disease type C ( NPC ) is a lethal , autosomal recessive , lysosomal storage disorder characterized by neurodegeneration in early childhood and death in adolescence . The causative genes NPC1 ( about 95 % of cases ) and NPC2 ( about 5 % of cases ) are involved in the intracellular trafficking of lipids and cholesterol . Mutations on either of these genes lead to progressive accumulation of unesterified cholesterol and other lipids in the central nervous system ( CNS ) . The National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) Therapeutics for Rare and Neglected Diseases ( TRND ) program is developing 2-hydroxypropyl-Beta-cyclodextrin ( HP-Beta-CD ) for the treatment of patients with Niemann-Pick disease type C1 ( NPC1 ) to slow progression of symptoms of the disease . In this Phase 1 , non-randomized , open-label , single-center , study , we propose to administer HP-Beta-CD intrathecally via lumbar injection to drug naive cohorts of 3 patients at doses of 200 mg escalated to 300 , 400 mg and 900 mg . Subsequent dose escalations may occur in increments of up to 300 mg . The objectives of this study are to assess the safety , tolerability , feasibility , and pharmacokinetics ( PK ) of intrathecally ( IT ) administered HP-Beta-CD to NPC1 patients , to determine an active dose of HP-Beta-CD as measured by changes in plasma 24- ( S ) hydroxycholesterol ( 24 ( S ) -HC ) concentration , and to evaluate the use of biomarkers and potential clinical outcomes of NPC1 . All patients in the cohort will receive HP-Beta-CD ( n = 3 ) once monthly for at least two doses , and the decision to dose-escalate will be based on safety and on biochemical data . Safety will be assessed by adverse events ( AEs ) , audiologic evaluation , clinical laboratory tests , vital signs , physical examinations , chest X-rays and electrocardiograms ( ECGs ) . Biochemical efficacy will be measured by change from baseline in plasma 24 ( S ) -HC . PK will be assessed for plasma HP-Beta-CD .",2012-12-08,"July 19, 2021","INCLUSION CRITERIA : Aged greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 25 years old at time of enrollment , either gender and any ethnicity .

University of Illinois at Chicago,NCT01749293,Partially HLA Mismatched (Haploidentical) Allogeneic Bone Marrow Transplantation,University of Illinois at Chicago,2,0,Hematologic Malignancies,Procedure,Haploidentical Transplant,Treatment,,"Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is a potentially curative treatment for patients with many hematologic malignancies ( e.g . leukemia , lymphoma , and myeloma with high risk of relapse ) . This process requires a suitable donor . The best case scenario involves an Human Leukocyte Antigen ( HLA ) matched sibling donor . However , this type of donor is not always available . Donor registries can provide another source for matched unrelated donors , but this may take valuable time delaying treatment for the transplant recipient . Donor availability remains a significant barrier to the use of allogeneic ( from a donor ) stem cell transplant . This issue disproportionately affects patients of minority backgrounds . Novel strategies to improve outcomes using alternative donors are desperately needed . Haploidentical transplants are an alternative which provides a readily available donor in the form of a partially HLA matched family member . This provides for more potential donors and the donors can be selected based on other factors that can play a role in transplant success ( e.g . age , gender , KIR alloreactivity ) . Recent advances in transplant techniques have greatly improved success rates with haploidentical transplants although disease relapse has remained as issue . This trial aims to provide an alternative transplant option for patients with hematologic malignancies who require bone marrow transplantation but lack an HLA identical donor . The investigational component of this study is the combination of the Fludarabine/ Busulfan/ Total Body Irradiation conditioning regimen and the HLA Haploidentical Transplant with post-transplant Cyclophosphamide .","Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is a potentially curative treatment for patients with hematologic malignancies such as leukemia , lymphoma and myeloma who are at high risk of relapse . As well as the potential to deliver high doses of chemotherapy or radiation this procedure affords the benefit of an immunologic weapon against disease in the form of the graft versus tumor effect . The major variables affecting the outcome of allogeneic transplant include : patient selection ( age and comorbidities ) ; disease status at the time of transplantation ( remission vs. active disease ) ; type of donor ( HLA matched vs. mismatched or related vs. unrelated ) ; type of conditioning regimen ; source of stem cells ( bone marrow vs. peripheral blood ) . Recent advances in the field of stem cell transplant have substantially lowered transplant related morbidity and mortality . The availability of stem cell transplant as a treatment modality is dependent upon the availability of a suitable donor . Best outcomes are thought to occur in HLA matched sibling donors . The chance of a sibling being HLA matched is approximately 25 % . Despite the development of large worldwide donor registries the likelihood of finding an HLA matched unrelated donor is 60-70 % at best and drops to 10 % in some ethnic minorities . In addition the process of identifying , confirming and harvesting an unrelated donor is cumbersome and time consuming at a time when the patient must proceed immediately to transplant ( time from initiation of search to identification of an unrelated donor identification takes a median of 49 days ) . Therefore the development of alternative sources of hematopoietic stem cells is an area of immense interest to many investigators . Alternative sources include cord blood and HLA haploidentical donors . Cord blood has been an attractive source permitting immediate availability and possibly a lower rate of graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) . However delay in engraftment , particularly after myeloablative conditioning , remains a significant disadvantage . Haploidentical transplants carry some of the same advantages with virtually all patients having immediate access to a suitable and willing donor in the form of a partially HLA matched family member . Furthermore the number of potential donors allows for donor selection based upon factors such as age , gender , KIR alloreactivity . Finally the donor is readily available for future cellular therapies such as donor lymphocyte infusion . Early attempts at haploidentical transplantation were hampered by high rates of graft failure and severe graft versus host disease . Recent advances in graft versus host disease prophylaxis with post transplant high dose cyclophosphamide ( Cy ) have overcome these barriers to a large degree . Published studies have shown that HLA-haploidentical bone marrow transplant ( BMT ) after non-myeloablative conditioning and using 2 doses of post-transplantation Cy followed by tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) is a well-tolerated procedure . However , the major cause of treatment failure in this high-risk population was early relapse . As conditioning intensity has been clearly linked to rates of relapse in multiple diseases , it is postulated that utilizing conditioning with higher anti-tumor potential will lead to a lower relapse rate . Given the advances in GVHD prophylaxis with post-transplantation Cy , reduced intensity conditioning with Fludarabine , Busulfan and total body irradiation combined with high-dose post-transplantation Cy is the platform for this study . The toxicities of this reduced intensity conditioning regimen are not expected to differ substantially from previous data incorporating post-transplantation Cy . However , this regimen may have higher anti-tumor potential resulting in a decreased relapse rate .",2012-11-20,"February 12, 2020","Inclusion Criteria : First-degree related donor or half-sibling who is at minimum HLA haploidentical Lack of fully matched donor ( related or unrelated ) .

Low blood phosphorus can cause muscle and bone weakness ( such as rickets ) and teeth problems . One cause of the condition is having too much fibroblast growth factor 23 ( FGF23 ) . FGF23 is a hormone that causes the kidney to get rid of phosphorus in the urine . It can also prevent the body from making vitamin D , which helps the body absorb phosphorus in food . Many people with low blood phosphorus take high doses of phosphorus and calcium medications . However , one side effect of these drugs is increased blood levels of parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) . The drug cinacalcet can help lower PTH levels , which may decrease the amount of phosphorus lost in the urine and increase the phosphorus levels in the blood . Researchers want to see if cinacalcet can help blood phosphorus and decrease the amount of phosphorus supplements that people need to take . Objectives : - To see if cinacalcet can be a safe and effective treatment for people with low phosphorus conditions due to high FGF23 . Eligibility : - Individuals between 18 and 70 years of age who have different forms of hypophosphatemic rickets and tumor-induced hypophosphatemia Design : Participants will have up to 25 study visits over about 28 weeks . Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history . Blood and urine samples will be collected . Up to three more lab visits for blood and urine tests will be required before treatment . Imaging studies of the bones , spine , and kidneys will be performed . Participants will have a 3-night hospital stay to start treatment . They will take cinacalcet once a day . Treatment will be monitored with frequent blood tests and imaging studies . Participants will continue to take cinacalcet once a day for 3 weeks . They will have regular study visits to monitor the treatment . There will be up to two other overnight hospital stays ( 1 to 3 nights ) to adjust cinacalcet doses . The dose will increase until the maximum dose is reached , or side effects develop . After the end of the cinacalcet study , participants will have several more followup visits to monitor the effects of treatment .","OBJECTIVES : The primary objective of this protocol is to evaluate the tolerability of cinacalcet in individuals with fibroblast growth factor 23 ( FGF23 ) -mediated hypophosphatemia , using an open-label , dose-titration study of once-daily dosing . Secondary objectives are to evaluate the pharmacodynamics of cinacalcet in this subject population and to explore the efficacy of cinacalcet by comparing a ) level of oral phosphate required at baseline to the level required at maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) and b ) change in renal phosphate handling from baseline to MTD . Tertiary objectives are to evaluate tolerability , pharmacodynamics , and efficacy of twice daily dosing of each subject s MTD of cinacalcet after completion of the once-daily dose-titration phase . A final objective is to determine the length of time it takes for subjects to return to their pre-treatment steady state once treatment is complete . STUDY POPULATION : Up to 17 subjects with FGF23-mediated hypophosphatemia will be treated . DESIGN : This study is an open-label , dose-titration study of once-daily dosing of cinacalcet , with up to 4 escalating doses given at approximately 3 week intervals . After an initial standard of care optimization period of 2-9 weeks , subjects will proceed to the cinacalcet dose-titration period . Subjects who experience extended toxicity or study drug related serious adverse events or other related , intolerable adverse events will be down titrated to a lower dose of study medication . After subjects have achieved their own maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) and completed the once-daily dosing phase , they will continue the study medication for approximately 3 additional weeks with twice daily dosing at their MTD . At the end of the cinacalcet treatment phase of the study , cinacalcet will be discontinued and standard of care ( SOC ) medications will be adjusted/restarted on an individualized basis . Subjects will continue in this final SOC safety follow-up period for up to 4 weeks until their SOC medications have been re-equilibrated .

Yale University,NCT01742793,"An Open Label, International, Multi-centre, Phase I/IIa Study of Lenalidomide (Revlimid) and Romidepsin (Istodax) for Relapsed /Refractory Hodgkin Lymphoma, Mature T-cell Lymphoma and Multiple Myeloma. (RId Study)",Yale University,1,0,Hodgkin's Lymphoma,Drug,lenalidomide (Revlimid) and romidepsin (Istodax),Treatment,,The study hypothesis is that lenalidomide and romidepsin ( and dexamethasone for patients with myeloma ) will have an acceptable toxicity profile and that in combination will have sufficient activity in the target population ( including those previously refractory to HDACi monotherapy ) to warrant further investigation .,"Summary of rationale : As individual agents , both the histone deacetylase inhibitors and lenalidomide have significant activity in each of the diseases in this study ; There is potential for the agents to synergize ( to improve upon the response rates as there are both overlapping and disparate mechanisms of action . ) Both agents may synergize to induce cell death through caspase 8-mediated and other mechanisms ; both induce p21 and cell cycle arrest ; both agents have anti-angiogenic effects ; both are likely to interfere with PI3K/Akt signaling . One particularly attractive aspect of this combination is the potential for synergistic immunological effects , particularly related to T-cell polarization , NK cell activation , STAT signaling and cytokine production , as discussed above ; With respect to PTCL , CTCL and HL , there is a clear path for further drug development and registration if this trial proves that this is a safe and efficacious combination ; Myeloma is incurable and this is due to the persistence of a drug-resistant sub-clone of tumor-propagating cells that is drug insensitive . Preclinical data suggests that both HDACi and lenalidomide may target these tumor-propagating cells . This argues for examining this combination as part of early treatment in these diseases . This trial is the first step to examine the feasibility of combining an HDACi with what is front-line therapy in myeloma in the USA - lenalidomide . Incorporating three separate arms ( as opposed to three separate studies ) will allow ; i . The investigators to accumulate data on this novel combination across the three groups and evaluate the toxicity profiles to make informed decisions around dose-escalation . Because it is a single study , valid comparisons can be made across the groups , which would not be possible if they were separate studies . ii . combined and simplified collection of correlative tests across the three studies .

Mayo Clinic,NCT01605370,Can Nebivolol Reverse Inappropriate Left Ventricular Mass in Hypertensive Patients?,Mayo Clinic,4,0,Hypertension,Drug,Nebivolol,Treatment,Double,The purpose of this study is to evaluate if a drug called nebivolol can reverse inappropriate left ventricular mass ( LVM ) when compared to the standard of care drug metoprolol .,"In response to chronic pressure overload by arterial hypertension , the cardiac left ventricle undergoes hypertrophy , that is , increases its wall thickness and , therefore , its mass , to sustain the elevated workload . Such anatomical remodeling can be considered adaptive or appropriate . However , in a considerable number of patients with arterial hypertension , the increase in the left ventricular mass is excessive and , thus , inappropriate . Ventricular mass is inappropriate when its amount surpasses the physical need of the ventricle to sustain the elevated workload . Therefore , ventricular mass can be inappropriate even in patients without arterial hypertension or without hypertrophy identified by echocardiography ( echo ) . We can mathematically predict an appropriate amount of mass and observe the actual mass in individual patients based on ventricular workload and wall thickness , respectively , noninvasively evaluated by echo . By comparing the observed ventricular mass to the predicted one , we determine whether its amount is inappropriate . It follows that by therapeutically normalizing blood pressure in hypertension and thus eliminating the elevated workload , then any ventricular hypertrophy represents an inappropriate mass . Inappropriate ventricular mass is proven to have a detrimental effect on long-term cardiovascular event-free survival , and ventricular hypertrophy is increasingly recognized as a potent risk factor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality , and all-cause mortality . Ventricular performance is altered in hypertension with inappropriate mass , but this alteration can be subtle enough to escape detection using current echocardiography measures . Hence , patients with hypertension , who have inappropriate left ventricular mass , need to be specifically identified by analysis of the predicted and observed ventricular mass , and the therapeutic goal must include management of elevated blood pressure as well as reversal of the excessive ventricular mass . In this double-blind prospective study , patients with hypertension and inappropriate ventricular mass will be randomized to therapy with nebivolol or metoprolol to find out whether nebivolol could reverse inappropriate left ventricular mass , thus providing a benefit beyond what is achieved by mere blood pressure reduction alone . If confirmed , this will represent a significant ancillary ability of nebivolol and be a key step towards therapy of inappropriate ventricular mass , which is a so far unmanaged cardiovascular risk and a poor event-free prognostic factor .",2012-05-22,"May 8, 2014","All candidates must have previously untreated hypertension .

However , the benefit of such surgery remains largely controversial . On one hand , many clinicians believe that surgical resection offers the only chance for long term survival . Many studies reported a median survival of 6-40 months after liver resection and thrombectomy , and some cases achieved long term survival.On the other hand , the strength of evidences arising from these studies was widely questioned because of their retrospective nature and study design . Most of them were single arm cohort study . A few studies used control groups consisted of patients with unresectable HCC and PVTT underwent transarterial chemoembolization . This led to obvious selection bias . Because patients with unresectable HCC and PVTT have a much poorer prognosis compared with resectable disease because of more widespread tumor focus and less residual liver , even if their baseline characters are comparable .",2012-05-13,"January 22, 2019",Inclusion Criteria : The diagnosis of HCC was made according to AASLD guidelines Main tumor ≥ 7 cm Imaging confirmed the presence of PVTT in the first branches but not Extend into the main trunk of portal vein Eastern Co-operative Group performance Resectable disease Exclusion Criteria : Child-Pugh class B or C liver cirrhosis An American Society of Anesthesiologists ( ASA ) score ≥ 3 Extrahepatic metastasis Patients had access to sorafenib .,126,0,18 Years,75 Years

The pain of the fracture is thought to originate from the femoral shaft periosteum and muscle spasm from the quadriceps mechanism . Fascia iliaca compartment block FIC is easy and simple technique , there is no need for high-skill or expensive equipments . It has higher success rate in more than 90 % of the children thigh procedures . Potentially dexmedetomidine has become an alternative to clonidine , it is a highly selective α2 agonist having about an 8-10 times affinity for α2 adrenergic receptors than clonidine and much less α1 effects , which is responsible for the hypnotic and analgesic effects . Perinural dexmedetomidine in combination with bupivacaine or ropivacaine enhance sensory and motor block without neurotoxicity in experimental studies.It has been reported to improve the quality of intrathecal , Epidural , and caudal anesthesia in children . Also , it is safe and effective in IV regional anesthetic and axillary block in adult . No study-up to the date -has been carried to evaluate its effect on the character of fascia iliaca compartment blocks as adjuvant to bupivacaine . The objectives of this study were designed to detect the effects of addition dexmedetomidine ( Precedex- Abbot ) as adjuvant to bupivacaine for fascia iliaca block on the quality of postoperative analgesia and also to determine its effects on the hemodynamics , recovery behaviors , sedation and possible side effects in children undergoing thigh surgeries ( fracture femur ) .","All the patients were premedicated with oral midazolam 0.5 mg/kg,1 hour prior to induction .

Participants will be Veterans from the first Gulf War ( GW1 ) who often suffer from chronic pain problems .,"A number of studies have been conducted on the health of Veterans deployed to Iraq during GW1 . The focus of these studies has been primarily to define the nature of symptoms and symptom clusters and to determine if evidence supports the definition of a new unique illness . Most noteworthy is the `` Iowa Study '' , a cross-sectional study of 3,695 Veterans from Iowa consisting of those who were and were not deployed in GW1 . In telephone interviews the Gulf War deployed Veterans reported approximately twice the number of symptoms compared to those who were not deployed . The often ambiguous and seemingly treatment resistant symptoms presented by GW1 Veterans represent a challenge to the Veteran 's Affairs Health Care System on two fronts ; efficacy in treatment and cost . In particular , unlike most medical conditions which can be diagnosed by objective medical findings , pain is a subjective experience ( International Association for the Study of Pain , 1994 ) . Therefore the investigators propose to engage in a clinical trial of rTMS in chronic pain that occurs in the context of multiple medical symptoms in the GW1 population . The symptom category approach will be applied with the restriction that enrolled GWI diagnosed patients will have symptoms of chronic pain as outlined in the musculoskeletal category and at least two additional symptoms .",2012-05-25,"April 10, 2017","Inclusion Criteria : Born between 1936 and 1973 ( ages 18 to 55 during Gulf War I ) and were deployed to the Persian Gulf during Gulf War I .

Baylor College of Medicine,NCT01604031,Treatment of B-CLL With Autologous IL2 and CD40 Ligand-Expressing Tumor Cells + Lenalidomide,Baylor College of Medicine,1,0,B-cell Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia,Biological,B-CLL Vaccine,Treatment,,"This is a research study to determine the safety and effectiveness of using special cells that may make the subject 's immune system fight their chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) in combination with a drug called Lenalidomide . To do this , the investigators will put a special gene into cancer cells that have been taken from the subject . This will be done in the laboratory . This gene will make the cells produce interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) , which is a natural substance that may help the subject 's immune system kill cancer cells . Additionally , the investigators will stimulate the cancer cells with normal embryonic fibroblasts ( cells that develop into normal connective tissues in the body ) so that they will make another natural protein called CD40 ligand ( CD40L ) . Some of these cells will then be put back into the subject 's body with the goal that they will act like a vaccine and stimulate the immune system to attack the CLL cells . The investigators have already conducted a study similar to this in other subjects with CLL . In those subjects the investigators saw some changes in the subject 's immune system that might indicate that the modified cells were helping their immune system fight the cancer . However , in most of the subjects this change in the immune system went away after the injections were stopped . The investigators think that this may be due to a high level of cells called T regulatory cells . T regulatory cells are part of the immune system and prevent excessive reactions from other cells in the body . Studies have shown that reducing T regulatory cells allows the body to fight the cancer for a longer period of time . Recent studies have shown that using Lenalidomide helps the body reduce T regulatory cells . Using Lenalidomide along with the injections ( shots ) might help the body fight the cancer for a longer period of time . Lenalidomide is also called Revlimid . In this study the investigators want to see if they can make the change in the immune system last longer by giving Lenalidomide before and at the same time as the vaccine . The investigators hope that this might produce a better response directed at the CLL cells . Subjects will receive injections for about a year","Previously , some of the cancer cells were taken from the subject 's body and separated in the laboratory and a specially produced human virus ( adenovirus ) that carries the IL-2 gene was put into the cells . Adenovirus is a common virus found in human respiratory systems . In its normal state , it can reproduce and cause a respiratory infection . Respiratory illnesses caused by adenovirus infections range from the common cold to pneumonia , croup and bronchitis . This adenovirus has been changed in the laboratory so that it is not likely to reproduce or cause an infection once it is in the body . The gene transfer method used in this study tries to add copies of the IL2 gene that increases the immune response against a tumor . The rest of the cancer cells have been stimulated to express on their surface a substance called the human CD40L . These substances ( IL-2 and CD40L ) , already naturally present in the body , are meant to help the immune system fight the cancer . At the point that the doctor feels the subject should begin treatment on this protocol , the treatment will be as follows : The subject will begin taking Allopurinol by mouth at 300 mg and will continue taking Allopurinol daily for 14 days . Allopurinol is also called Zyloprim and it will be taken to prevent tumor lysis syndrome . Tumor lysis syndrome can be a serious condition that occurs sometimes when cancer treatment is started . Tumor lysis syndrome can cause other medical problems . Two days after Allopurinol was started , the subject will begin taking Lenalidomide . The Lenalidomide dose will be 5 mg taken by mouth daily . The subject should swallow the capsules whole with water at the same time each day and should not break , chew or open the capsules . Females of childbearing potential who are caring for the subject should not touch the lenalidomide capsules or bottles without gloves . If a dose of lenalidomide is missed , it should be taken as soon as possible on the same day . If it is missed for the entire day , it should not be made up . If more than the prescribed dose is taken of lenalidomide and the subject feels poorly , s/he should seek emergency medical care and tell the study staff right away . The subject will get 1 cycle of drug per month . A max of a 28-day supply of the drug will be provided at one time . If the subject has bad side effects the doctor may tell him/her not to take the lenalidomide for a short time period or may be removed from the study . Otherwise , the subject will continue daily dosing with Lenalidomide for approximately 1 year , until four weeks after the final vaccine . Four weeks after the subject starts the Lenalidomide s/he will start to receive his/her vaccines . The vaccine will be injected under the skin ( also called subcutaneously ) . Normally the subject will have the shots as an outpatient ( no overnight stay in the hospital will be required ) . S/he will receive the first five ( 5 ) shots at 2 week intervals . S/he will then receive eleven ( 11 ) shots at 4 weekly intervals . In total , the subject may receive up to sixteen ( 16 ) shots over a period of one year . As with the Lenalidomide if the subject has bad side effects s/he may not receive his/her vaccines for a short period of time or may be removed from the study . Otherwise , the subject will receive the vaccines on the schedule as specified earlier in this paragraph . These shots must be given at Houston Methodist Hospital . Following these injections , the doctor will follow the subject for 1 year after the last shot to see how the subject is doing . TESTS DURING AND AFTER EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENT : A complete history and physical examination is necessary before the subject can be enrolled in the study . A physical examination will also be performed each time s/he receives a shot of the modified cells . The place on the subject 's body where s/he had received the shots will be examined during the physical exam . Research Blood Samples : Blood will be taken from a tube placed into the vein ( IV ) . We will take blood samples at the following time points : at study entry , week 0 when the subject starts Lenalidomide , weeks 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 and 16 and then every 4 weeks until week 60 . The last blood sample will be at one year after the last shot . We will do this to make sure that the Lenalidomide is working correctly and to study how the modified cells are working in the body . The amount of blood that will be obtained each time is approximately 2-3 tablespoonfuls , which is considered to be a safe amount . If the subject has a central line ( an IV line that has been placed in a large blood vessel that is meant to be used for long periods of time ) , the blood will be taken from it , so that extra `` sticks '' should not be needed . Additional office visits may be necessary to obtain this blood . The maximum total amount of blood to be collected from the subject is 40-60 tablespoons . Other tests : If the subject is a woman who can get pregnant , she will have pregnancy counseling and urine tests as long as she is taking lenalidomide . In order to participate in this study , the subject must register into and follow the requirements of the Revlimid REMS® program of Celgene Corporation ( the company that supplies Lenalidomide ) . This program provides education and counseling on the risks of fetal exposure , blood clots and reduced blood counts that can occur when taking Lenalidomide . The subject will be required to receive counseling every 28 days during treatment with lenalidomide , follow the pregnancy testing and birth control requirements of the program that are appropriate for him/her and take telephone surveys regarding your compliance with the program . Participating in the Revlimid REMS® program is a study requirement .",2012-05-04,"February 5, 2016","Inclusion Criteria : ELIGIBILITY FOR BLAST COLLECTION ( procurement ) : Patients with B-CLL ( not in Richter 's transformation ) with measurable disease .

Trio Medicines Ltd.,NCT01601405,Effect of Repeated Doses of YF476 on Stomach Acidity,Trio Medicines Ltd.,1,1,Hypergastrinaemia,Drug,YF476,Basic Science,,The objectives of the study were : To show that a single dose of YF476 blocks gastrin receptors in healthy subjects To show that YF476 retains its ability to block gastrin receptors after repeated dosing despite losing its ability to suppress gastric acidity .,"The rationale for this study was as follows . On the basis of the pre-clinical studies , the original target disease for YF476 was gastro-oesophageal reflux disease ( GORD ) , not only because of the excellent anti-secretory activity of YF476 but also because of its potential for increasing gastric emptying . But loss of the anti-secretory effect of YF476 in healthy subjects after repeated dosing excludes its use as an anti-secretory agent in patients with GORD . However , there is some evidence from within our repeated-dose studies in healthy subjects that gastrin receptors are blocked despite loss of the anti-secretory activity of YF476 . Further evidence that repeated doses of YF476 cause sustained blockade of gastrin receptors comes from several types of study in animals . First , in the 13-week toxicology studies , all dose levels of YF476 reduced the ECL population , unlike other anti-secretory agents , histamine H2-antagonists and proton-pump inhibitors , which increase the ECL population . Second , YF476 at doses of 0.1 and 1.0 mg/kg subcutaneously twice daily for 14 days in rats abolished the increase in gastric output induced by pentagastrin on Days 1 , 7 and 14 . This protocol describes a study in healthy subjects using inhibition of pentagastrin-induced gastric acid output as a surrogate marker of efficacy of YF476 . Pentagastrin has been used for many years to test gastric function in healthy subjects and patients . Intravenous infusion of 0.6 micrograms/kg/hour is a submaximal and well-tolerated dose .",2012-05-16,"May 16, 2012","Inclusion Criteria : Healthy male or female volunteers . Aged 18-45 years .

Washington University School of Medicine,NCT01603758,Physiological Study of Human Cholesterol Metabolism and Excretion,"Richard E. Ostlund Jr., MD",1,1,Coronary Heart Disease,Drug,Ezetimibe,Basic Science,Quadruple,"The underlying hypothesis is that whole body cholesterol - including cholesterol present in tissues that can not be measured by standard blood tests - is related to heart disease risk . Endogenous cholesterol will be labeled with an intravenous infusion of one type of cholesterol tracer and dietary cholesterol will be labeled with another . These tracers will be used to measure how fast cholesterol is synthesized and excreted using mass spectrometry to distinguish the tracers . Data will be related to circulating biomarkers ( blood tests ) and to the thickness of the lining of the carotid artery . The effect of the drug ezetimibe on these processes will also be determined . Successful completion of this study will give us more knowledge about cholesterol metabolism that may be useful in designing new drugs and treatments for patients with heart disease , especially those that are already receiving maximum amounts of current medications .","The central hypothesis of this proposal is that reverse cholesterol transport is related to coronary heart disease ( CHD ) risk . It is complementary to the concept that reduction of cholesterol biosynthesis with statin drugs prevents CHD , but it focuses on whole body cholesterol metabolism and kinetic cholesterol transport rather than on static levels of circulating lipoproteins . Although this is an old idea , it has not been adequately tested in humans because of lack of suitable methods . In this proposal we will apply innovative stable isotope and mass spectroscopic technology to study reverse cholesterol transport in human subjects . The first specific aim is to improve the preparation of intravenous deuterated cholesterol tracer , a critical limiting element in the study of whole body cholesterol metabolism . The second aim is to use that intravenous tracer , along with a different oral tracer , to partition fecal cholesterol into excreted endogenous cholesterol , unabsorbed dietary cholesterol and newly-synthesized cholesterol derived from the liver and intestine . Measurements will be made during consumption of a controlled diet provided by the metabolic kitchen . The pool size of the rapidly-mixing body cholesterol pool will be measured along with the fractional rate of cholesterol catabolism . These direct measures of reverse cholesterol transport will be correlated with plasma biomarkers and with metabolic covariates . The relation of reverse cholesterol transport to carotid intima-media thickness will be determined . The third specific aim will use similar methods to study the mechanism of action for the widely-used drug ezetimibe . The fractional rate of endogenous cholesterol excretion and the rate of plasma cholesterol turnover will be determined in two periods , one with drug and one with placebo treatment . This work represents a new direction for cholesterol research with the potential to develop new and complementary methods of reducing CHD risk that can be added to diet and statin drug treatment .",2012-05-18,"May 5, 2016","Inclusion Criteria : Aim II . 100 subjects aged 30-80 with stable medical and/or surgical illnesses .

The research question of this study is , whether musculoskeletal sonography is a useful biomarker predicting a disease flare after cessation of bDMARD therapy .","Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) is the most common inflammatory joint disease . It is usually treated with synthetic and biologic disease modifying antirheumatic drugs ( DMARDs ) . Up to 35 % of patients can achieve clinical remission by the combination these therapies ; however , there is considerable uncertainty regarding the management of patients once this clinical state is achieved . The discontinuation of biological agents in patients with persistent clinical remission may be beneficial for the patients and the health care system reducing the risks of long term adverse events and saving costs , respectively .

University of Arkansas,NCT01602016,A Folinic Acid Intervention for Autism Spectrum Disorders,University of Arkansas,2,0,Autism Spectrum Disorder,Drug,Folinic Acid and placebo,Treatment,Quadruple,"Researchers at Arkansas Children 's Hospital Research Institute are conducting a study looking at the effects of Folinic Acid on language in Autism Spectrum Disorder and language impairment . The study has 3 phases . Phase 1 confirms that your child has language impairment ( there is no compensation for this visit ) . If language impairment is verified in the phase 1 screening , then your child will be eligible for phase 2 . Phase 2 consists of receiving 12 weeks of folinic acid or an inactive placebo , in addition to several evaluations of your child 's abilities and a single blood test . Children that complete phase 2 will be eligible for a 12 week open-label trial of folinic acid which is phase 3 .","Evidence-based interventions for autism spectrum disorders ( ASD ) are limited . Currently , there is no FDA approved medical therapy that addresses either core ASD symptoms or pathophysiological processes associated with ASD . For example , the two FDA approved antipsychotic medications for treating ASD are indicated for symptoms associated with ASD , not core ASD symptoms . Based on strong preliminary evidence , this study aims to improve core ASD symptoms with folinic acid . Two biological mechanisms for response to the intervention are proposed and investigated in this study . Folate is an essential B vitamin required for normal neurodevelopment . Folinic acid is a reduced form of folate that has been shown to improve both the metabolic and core symptoms associated with ASD in an open-label study and large case-series . This study will extend this preliminary evidence to demonstrate clinical efficacy of folinic acid in a double-blind placebo-controlled manner while also evaluating the biological mechanisms associated with the clinical response . Preliminary evidence for the efficacy of folinic acid is two-fold : First , several independent studies have demonstrated that a folinic acid intervention improves ASD core symptoms in ASD patients diagnosed with cerebral folate deficiency - a metabolic disorder in which the primary pathway for the transport of folate across the blood-brain barrier is dysfunctional . The primary transport pathway for folate across the blood-brain barrier uses the folate receptor α ( FRα ) and energy dependent endocytosis . A secondary pathway , the reduced folate carrier ( RFC ) , can transport reduced forms of folate , such as folinic acid , across the blood-brain barrier . In case-series of children with ASD and cerebral folate deficiency , folinic acid ( 0.5 to 2 mg/kg/day ) improved communication , social interaction , attention , and stereotypical behavior in some ( 3-6 ) and completely ameliorated ASD symptoms in others ( 6 , 7 ) . The major cause of cerebral folate deficiency is an autoantibody that binds to the FRα and interferes with its ability to bind and transport folate . Recently , Frye et al . found that ( a ) autoantibodies to the FRα were present in approximately 75 % of children with ASD , and ( b ) an intervention with folinic acid ( 2mg/kg/day ; max 50mg ) in children with ASD and FRα autoantibodies resulted in significant improvements in parental ratings of receptive and expressive language , verbal communication , stereotypic behavior , and attention as compared to parental rating for children that did not undergo any intervention ( wait group ) over a similar time period . This proposal will extend these preliminary findings by documenting response to a folinic acid intervention in a double-blind placebo-controlled manner and test whether FRα autoantibody titers predict response to a folinic acid intervention . If FRα autoantibody titers are found to predict response to the intervention , such titers could provide a biomarker to identify a subset of children with ASD that may benefit from a folinic acid intervention and may even predict the development of ASD symptoms in high risk siblings during the presymptomatic period . Second , the ratio of reduced-to-oxidized glutathione ( GSH/GSSG ) is an established measure of systemic redox status and oxidative stress that has been shown in three independent case-control studies to be significantly decreased in many ASD children . James et al . have shown in a 3 month open-label clinical trial that an intervention of folinic acid and methyl-B12 significantly improved GSH/GSSG and Vineland scores for expressive language , receptive language , and socialization in ASD children . Important unanswered questions are ( a ) whether this preliminary data can be confirmed in a larger double-blind placebo-controlled study , ( b ) whether redox status before the folinic acid intervention can predict response to intervention and ( c ) whether improved systemic redox status is associated with improvement in core ASD symptoms . This study will assess whether a folinic acid intervention can improve both core symptoms of ASD ( i.e. , communication , socialization , stereotyped movements ) and associated comorbid symptoms ( i.e. , attention ) in a double-blind placebo controlled clinical trial . This study will address whether improvements in core ASD symptoms associated with the intervention are related to biomarkers of either ( or both ) biological mechanisms proposed to be influenced by the intervention ( i.e. , GSH/GSSG , FRα autoantibody titer ) . Thus , using these biomarkers , it may be possible that children with ASD who optimally respond to the folinic acid intervention can be readily identified early after diagnosis or even during the pre-symptomatic period . This double blind , placebo-controlled ( DBPC ) study will evaluate the efficacy of Folinic Acid for the treatment of language impaired autism spectrum disorder patients aged 3-14 years . The study will consist of a single site trial with approximatley 48 entering the DBPC phase . Subjects will be male or female with current or prospective diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder ( ASD ) . Language Impairments will be defined by the CELF , or PLS when warranted . Phase 1 will consist of approximately 57children aged 3-14 with a diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder ( as defined by the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule or the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised ) , until approximately 48 children with confirmed ASD are enrolled into a randomized control trial ( RCT ; Phase 2 ) . Enrollment will continue as needed until approximately 43 complete Phase 2 . Approximately 40 will enroll into phase 3 . Initial analyses will be undertaken to inspect data for errors , inconsistencies , and incomplete information . This will include examining the data with simple frequency tables and dot plots for univariate data and scatter plots and multi-way dot plots with bivariate and multivariate data . To summarize bivariate relationships among predictors and between predictors and outcomes , Spearman 's rank correlation coefficient will be used . For reporting inferential statistics , regression coefficients along with the 95 percent confidence intervals will be used extensively to quantify degree of clinical importance . The primary population will be the Intent-to-Treat ( ITT ) population and is defined as all subjects who have completed at least one post treatment primary outcome measure . A secondary analysis will be performed on the `` as treated '' population defined as those subjects who had at least 75 % compliance of prescribed medications and have not significantly deviated from the protocol . To determine whether the folinic acid intervention over a 12-week period improves core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder in Phase 2 , the procedure Proc Mixed in SAS will be used to fit a mixed model analysis of covariance . For the multisite study , the full model with the response variable language assessment will include predictors such as : intervention , time , autoantibody , intervention by time interaction , autoantibody by intervention interaction , redox status , redox status by time interaction , and baseline covariates . However , for the single site study , the number of variables in the model will be limited due to the smaller sample size and separate models will be performed on subgroups to compare the effects of the treatment in various subgroups . The results from the mixed model will determine if the biomarkers of physiological abnormalities , both autoantibodies and redox status , predict intervention response . Similar analysis will be performed for the secondary outcomes .",2012-05-15,"September 13, 2017","Inclusion Criteria 1 .

Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois,NCT01611506,"Combination Chemotherapy, Cetuximab and Radiation for Patients With Localized Gastric Cancer",Dr Anna Dorothea Wagner,1,0,Gastric Cancer,Biological,Cetuximab,Treatment,,"RATIONALE : Radiotherapy is currently the most efficient way to induce pathologic responses , which are associated with a favorable prognosis in localized tumors . Novel radiotherapy techniques are associated with significantly less toxicity than traditional radiation protocols and permit to avoid the toxicity to adjacent organs . Established chemotherapy regimens , such as cisplatin and capecitabine , and monoclonal antibodies , such as cetuximab , can block tumor growth in different ways . Giving radiation therapy together with cisplatin and cetuximab before surgery aims to induce a pathological response and improve the prognosis after surgery . PURPOSE : This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of radiation therapy when given together with cisplatin and cetuximab in treating patients who are undergoing surgery for locally advanced gastric cancer .","OBJECTIVES : Primary • To determine the maximum tolerated dose of radio-chemo-immunotherapy - in patients with localized or locally advanced gastric cancer Secondary To determine the efficacy , as measured by major histopathological response rates ( tumor regression grade 1 and 2 ) Metabolic response Secondary resectability R-0 resection rate Surgical morbidity Toxicity Overall survival Time to local and systemic progression after R0-resection Feasibility OUTLINE : Prospective , multicenter , open-label dose escalating phase Ib trial During induction chemo-immuno-therapy , patients receive cetuximab IV over 1-2 hours on days 1 , cisplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1 and capecitabine twice daily per os from the evening of day 1 to the morning of day 15 . Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity . Radiotherapy will start after the end of the third cycle of chemotherapy and be performed concomitantly with weekly cetuximab and cisplatin . Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of radiotherapy ( levels of 36/39.6/45 Gy ) until the maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) is determined . The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which maximum 3 of 12 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity . Gastric resection should be performed within 4-6 weeks after completion of neoadjuvant treatment . 4-6 weeks after surgery , a further 3 cycles of chemo-immuno-therapy will be administered if the patient has recovered from surgery and the treatment is considered as feasible by the investigator . For note : Cisplatin may be replaced by oxaliplatin during induction chemotherapy and postoperative chemotherapy . In case if oxaliplatin is used to replace cisplatin during induction chemotherapy , replacement of cisplatin by oxaliplatin during radio-chemo-immunotherapy may also be considered by the investigator . Capecitabine may be replaced by infusional 5-FU on day 1-5 every 21 days in case of contraindications to capecitabine . In case if both cisplatin and capecitabine are to be replaced , 4 cycles of FOLFOX-6 ( d-l leucovorin , followed by 5-FU bolus and a continuous infusion of over 46 hours every 2 weeks should be administered in combination with cetuximab ) .

It principally concerns adult patients between 30 and 50 years of age . Women present with this disease 2 times more frequently than men . Family cases are observed in 50 % with a dominant autosomal transmission and low penetrance ( 40 % ) . In its early stages , the disease is mainly located at the stapediovestibular joint leading to its ankylosis and a conductive hearing loss . In its advanced stages , the lesions extend around the cochlea and vestibule , induce a sensorineural hearing loss which can progress to severe and profound deafness , and prolonged balance disorders . On CT-scan , disease foci show a demineralization . Their density is inversely correlated to the hearing loss . In early stage , hearing function is currently rehabilitated by conventional hearing aids or surgery . In advanced forms , cochlear involvement is not accessible to surgery , and rehabilitation is insured by he hearing aids or cochlear implants . Vestibular dysfunction is dealt with by physiotherapy or symptomatic treatment . Drugs with anabolic activity in bone , such as sodium fluoride and etidronate ( first generation bisphosphonate , Didronel ® ) , appear to reduce the hearing loss and to increase the radiological density of disease foci . However , their efficacy is low and poorly documented . Their effect on vestibular function is unknown . Moreover , ototoxicity has been reported for etidronate . New biphosphonates such as tiludronic acid ( Skelid ® ) have a significantly more potent inhibition of bone resorption and do not have an ototoxic effect .

With prevalence in middle-aged adults of 2-4 % of the population , untreated OSA has been implicated in increased risk for cardiovascular disease , including hypertension and heart failure . The first and most common treatment for OSA is continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) treatment , utilized by an estimated 3 million Americans . CPAP is effective in reducing apnea-hypopnea index ( AHI ) is used properly . However , the nasal mask required for CPAP during sleep leads to poor acceptance and compliance rates . Published studies on CPAP have shown that only 58-8- % of patient accept CPAP therapy and further 65-90 % of these patients exhibit long-term compliance with CPAP . It is widely accepted that the region behind the tongue is a major site of collapse during obstructive sleep apnea . In fact there are many surgical procedures performed currently to address tongue based collapse .

Massachusetts General Hospital,NCT01616160,An Open-label Study to Identify Molecular Markers of Steroid Resistance,Massachusetts General Hospital,4,0,Nasal Polyps,Drug,mometasone furoate,Basic Science,,"Aim 1 : To assess steroid sensitivity to mometasone furoate ( MF ) in cultured nasal polyp explant tissue in vitro . Aim 2 : To assess steroid sensitivity in vivo in each subject by comparing symptom scores , nasal endoscopic findings before and following 4 weeks of treatment with mometasone furoate nasal spray ( MFNS ) and by comparing tissue immunohistology in NP biopsies pre- and post-treatment withA MFNS . Aim 3 : To characterize the molecular signature of gene mRNA expression in `` steroid-sensitive '' and `` steroid-resistant '' NP using microarray on NP tissue pre- and post-MFNS treatment . Hypothesis 1 : Genes that regulate apoptosis are dysregulated in nasal polyp ( NP ) inflammatory cells , epithelial cells and smooth muscle actin myofibroblasts leading to persistence of inflammatory cell infiltration and abnormal epithelial and myofibroblast cellular proliferation . These can be corrected by mometasone . Apoptosis-regulating genes that can not be corrected by mometasone are upregulated in steroid-resistant NP . Elucidation of this dysregulation may prove insightful in understanding the mechanism of action of mometasone in NP and identifying potential molecular targets that will increase steroid sensitivity or , conversely , overcome steroid resistance . Hypothesis 2 : There is a molecular signature of gene expression in NP that signifies steroid sensitive NP ( SS-NP ) . This signature is altered in steroid resistant NP ( SR-NP ) . Elucidation of differences in the molecular signature of SS-NP versus SR-NP before and after treatment with mometasone furoate ( MFNS ) will provide novel insight into treatment of NP with steroids .","Visit 1 : Baseline evaluation and nasal endoscopy At this visit , each subject will sign an informed consent , the subject 's eligibility for the study will be confirmed , a medical history will be obtained , the subject will undergo a physical examination and nasal endoscopy . A urine pregnancy test will be performed on all females of childbearing potential . NP size will be recorded using the NP scoring system ( see below ) . Allergy skin testing will only be performed if it has not been done in the past 3 years . Visit 2 : Pre-treatment nasal polyp ( NP ) biopsies At this visit , each subject will undergo the pre-treatment NP biopsies . The biopsies will be obtained by Dr. Eric Holbrook at Massachusetts Eye & Ear Infirmary , located adjacent to MGH . Visit 3 : Initiation of treatment with MFNS At this visit , each subject will have a nasal speculum examination to confirm that there is no residual bleeding from the NP biopsies . Then , the subject will be given a 4 week supply of MFNS ( Nasonex ® ) and be instructed to take 2 sprays/nostril BID . Subjects will be given a NP symptom diary and instructed to record NP symptoms daily for 4 weeks . Each subject will be assigned a unique number ( screening or baseline number ) for identification purposes . Under no circumstances will a patient be assigned more than one allocation number . The Nasonex bottles will be dispensed from the MGH Research Pharmacy . Visit 4 : On-treatment NP biopsy At this visit , each subject will undergo the on-treatment NP biopsies . The biopsies will be obtained by Dr. Eric Holbrook at Massachusetts Eye & Ear Infirmary , located adjacent to MGH . The subject will be asked to withhold Nasonex treatment for 48 hours following this biopsy . Visit 5 : Post-biopsy Exam At this visit , each subject will have a nasal speculum examination to confirm that there is no residual bleeding from the NP biopsies . If bleeding has ceased , the subject will resume Nasonex treatment . Visit 5 6 : Final visit and nasal endoscopy At this visit , each subject will return their used and unused bottles of Nasonex and submit their NP symptom diary and undergo a nasal endoscopy . NP size will be recorded using the NP scoring system ( see below ) . Subjects will also complete a global assessment of efficacy of MFNS for their NP symptoms . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES : Pre-biopsies explant cultures : we will obtain NP biopsies for in vitro explant culture before steroid treatment from each patient . We will culture the explants in MF at 0 , 10-9 , 10-8 , 10-7 , 10-6 , 10-5M and analyze inflammatory cell infiltrate and steroid sensitivity based on induction of apoptosis ( activated caspase-3 expression ) in inflammatory cell subsets , alpha-smooth muscle cell actin+ myofibroblasts and epithelial cells . Each condition will be performed in duplicate so that one sample can be processed for IHC and one for microarray . Explant cultures : NP explants will be cultured in minimal essential medium for 24 hours at 37oC using flat-bottom tissue culture plates . Following 24 hours in culture , 1 explant per condition will be processed for IHC and 1 for microarray . We will also save culture supernatant from each explant condition for confirmation of important differences in protein production , based on data from the IHC and microarrays . Immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) and confocal laser immunofluorescence microscopy ( CLM ) : Frozen NP samples from SS-NP and SR-NP patients before and after MFNS treatment will be analyzed by immunofluorescence confocal laser microscopy ( IF-CLM ) for T lymphocyte ( CD3 and CD4 ) , MBP+ eosinophils , alpha-smooth muscle actin ( marker of activated myofibroblasts , monoclonal , R & D Systems , Inc. ) and cleaved caspase-3 ( polyclonal , CST , Beverly , MA ) . The number of inflammatory cells of each type and cleaved caspase-3 positive and negative cells of each type will be counted by two observers blinded to treatment and order of collection . A similar quantification of epithelial staining for PCNA ( a marker of epithelial cell proliferation ) and cleaved caspase-3 will be performed using semiquantitative grading of extent and intensity of staining as in our previous studies . The intensity and distribution of immunostaining will be quantified on a semi-quantitative grading scale of : 0 = absent staining , 1 = mild diffuse or moderate patchy staining ; 2 = moderate diffuse staining ; 3 = intense diffuse staining in the epithelium , stroma and glands by 2 independent observers . Histologic steroid-sensitive and steroid-resistant phenotype designation : Designation of NP subjects as histologically `` steroid-sensitive '' or `` steroid-resistant '' will be based on the following measures pre- and 1-week post-treatment with MFNS : extent of reduction in NP eosinophils improvement in NP inflammation , extent of induction of apoptosis in eosinophils , T lymphocytes and epithelial cells , extent of suppression of inflammatory gene expression based on microarray analysis . Subjects will be ranked in order from most sensitive to least sensitive to treatment . Linear regression will be used to examine correlations between these independent continuous variables . Microarray analysis : microarray analysis will be used to assess global gene mRNA expression and also capture information on pro- and anti-apoptotic gene expression in `` steroid sensitive '' ( SS-NP ) and `` steroid resistant '' SR-NP biopsies obtained before and 1 week following treatment with intranasal mometasone furoate ( MFNS ) . RNA isolation for microarray is done using the Arcturus picopure RNA isolation system . Plastic LCM collecting caps are incubated at 42oC for 30 minutes in 25 microliter of the kit 's GITC-containing extraction buffer , centrifuged briefly to collect the extracted solution , then frozen at -80oC . Samples are thawed and pooled prior to purification on picopure RNA columns , and genomic DNA is removed via RNAse-free DNAse ( Qiagen , Hilden , GmbH ) digestion on the columns . Total cellular RNAs from each column are eluted in 11 microliter of elution buffer and used for preparation of the RNA-Seq library , or converted into cDNA-for the QRTPCR assay , using a 20 microliter total reaction volume via the standard superscript III ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) protocol . We also have microarray data from 8 healthy control middle turbinates obtained in a previous study that will be used for comparison of gene expression to nasal polyps . RNA will be purified from one NP biopsy per patient using the ArrayPure™ Nano-scale RNA Purification Kit , ( EPICENTRE Biotechnologies , Madison , WI ) which includes ScriptGuard™ RNase Inhibitor to maintain the integrity of purified RNA . Purified RNA quality will be checked using RNA Nano Analysis ( Agilent Bioanalyzer , Quantum Analytics , Inc. , Foster City , CA ) . The lower limit sensitivity is 200 pg/ml , allowing us to verify the quality of RNA extracted from about 1250 cells . QRTPCR : Genes that are differentially expressed by RNA expression profiling will be further investigated by quantitative real-time RT-PCR from a separate small sample of purified RNA from each tissue compartment . RT-PCR will be performed using the Multiplex MX3000P quantitative RT-PCR system ( Stratagene , La Jolla , CA ) . Baseline gene expression will be quantified by QRTPCR relative to GAPDH using the delta-delta Ct ( 2-∆∆ ) method . Forward and reverse primers will be selected based on primerbank software ( http : //pga.mgh.harvard.edu/primerbank/ ) .

Plasma Adrenocorticotrophic hormone ( ACTH ) levels in these patients remain high , they are characteristically deeply pigmented , and may experience neurological effects as a consequence of the tumour . It is not known whether the tumour growth is due to the lack of cortisol feedback after adrenalectomy or whether the pituitary cells were preprogrammed to develop into a tumour . There is a real need for an effective medical management for Nelson 's syndrome . This is especially true given the increasing data on the somewhat disappointing longterm outcome of transsphenoidal surgery , and the increasing use of aparoscopic bilateral adrenalectomy for failures of pituitary surgery or even as primary therapy for Cushing 's disease . Therefore , it is likely that there will be increasing numbers of patients attending endocrine centres worldwide with Nelson 's syndrome following bilateral adrenalectomy as part of their management for Cushing 's disease . In view of this it is important to investigate all potential avenues for the treatment of Nelson 's syndrome and translate any benefits to patients .

Exercise has been shown to be an efficacious treatment component in combating nicotine dependence , especially among women for whom concerns about weight gain during smoking cessation are an obstacle to successful quitting . In previous trials of women smokers , the investigators program of cognitive behavioral smoking cessation treatment ( CBT ) plus regular aerobic exercise was more efficacious than CBT plus equal contact time . Recognizing the program 's successes , Commit to Quit ( CTQ ) was recently designated an Effective Program by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 's ( SAMHSA ) National Registry of Effective Programs . Thus , the Commit to Quit program is well poised for a larger trial in a community setting where it has the potential to reach a large number of female smokers in a setting in which it can be sustained . In response to PA-03-126 , Behavioral Therapies Development Program , the investigators propose a Stage III study in which they will conduct a trial to test the investigators CTQ smoking cessation program in the community setting of the local YMCAs . As stated in the PA , Stage III research is aimed at understanding if and how an efficacious therapy may be transported to the community . The investigators propose a randomized controlled clinical trial to take place in the YMCA setting and delivered by YMCA staff . The trial will compare CBT smoking cessation treatment plus a program of regular exercise to CBT smoking cessation treatment plus contact control . In order to promote transportability to the YMCA , the investigators will use the YMCA 's existing Personal Fitness Program , which is similar to the investigators CTQ exercise program , in that it is guided by trained staff and requires participants to exercise 3 times per week . If the exercise condition is found to be more efficacious than contact control when delivered at the YMCA by YMCA staff , then the investigators will be well positioned to partner with the YMCA to pursue widespread , national dissemination of this program .","We propose a randomized controlled clinical trial to take place in the YMCA setting and to be delivered by YMCA staff .

University of British Columbia,NCT01751347,Bupivacaine Versus Lidocaine Local Anesthesia,University of British Columbia,4,1,Carpal Tunnel Syndrome,Drug,Bupivacaine,Treatment,Double,"The use of local anesthetics has become an important aspect of pain management in surgical settings and is currently recommended in pain management guidelines . Elective outpatient hand surgeries , such as carpal tunnel or trigger finger release , cause minimum tissue disruption and are short in duration . As a result , these local anesthetic agents are a major component in post-operative pain control . The most commonly used local anesthetic agents are Lidocaine and Bupivacaine . Lidocaine acts faster ( within 2-5 minutes of injection ) and for this reason is often favored in outpatient setting for pre-incisional injection . However its effects only last up to 2 hours , without epinephrine , and 3 hours , with epinephrine . On the other hand , Bupivacaine , has a slower onset of action ( about 5-10 minutes after injection ) but its effects last much longer , for about 4-8 hours . The delay in onset of action makes it a less popular option as a primary source of local anesthesia in outpatient hand surgery . Given the longer duration of anesthesia offered by Bupivacaine , the investigators believe that by giving it pre-operatively in elective outpatient hand surgeries will offer more effective post operative pain control compared to using Lidocaine only . There is limited published data confirming the effectiveness of use of pre-operative Bupivicaine in improved postoperative pain control and decreased consumption of narcotics . Therefore , the aim in this study is to compare the postoperative pain experienced by patients undergoing either elective carpal tunnel release or trigger finger release as well as their use of pain medications when the incision site is infiltrated preemptively with Lidocaine versus Bupivacaine . The investigators believe that adequate post surgical pain control is essential for patients ' full functional recovery . Poorly controlled post surgical pain increases incidence of surgery related complications and thus increased health care costs . It can also reduce patients ' mobility , delay their return to full function , . If poorly controlled , post surgical pain may progress to chronic pain and rarely complex regional pain syndromes may ensue .","Subjects will be randomized to receive either 10ml of 0.5 % Bupivacaine with 1:200,000 Epinephrine or 10 ml of 1 % Lidocaine with 1:100,000 Epinephrine .

Primary Objective : To evaluate the safety and tolerability of 3-5 doses of 1000 - 2000 Units intravenous CINRYZE in NMO/NMOSD patients during an acute exacerbation . Secondary Objectives : To determine the frequency of adverse events with CINRYZE in this patient population . To determine the effect of CINRYZE on NMO clinical scores ( Expanded Disability Status Scale and Low Contrast Visual Acuity ) . To compare the change in MRI lesion size and extent following a course of CINRYZE .,"The rationale for using C1-esterase inhibitor ( CINRYZE ) in NMO is based on pathology showing a role for complement in active NMO lesions . NMO is not unique in involving complement , which may have a pathogenic role in other demyelinating diseases including multiple sclerosis . However , NMO is characterized by its complement involvement depositing in a rim or rosette pattern in all/most active lesions . In vitro , complement mediates damage initiated by anti-AQP4 antibody binding to astrocytes . The effector of antibody triggered cell damage is the complement cascade and blocking the complement cascade with C1-inhibitor prevents damage ex vivo . Based on mounting evidence , the consensus in the field is that prevention of the complement cascade in the CNS would ameliorate the damage caused in NMO inflammatory attacks . In contrast to a prevention trial , this study would provide for complement inhibition only during an active NMO attack . This approach is designed to administer the inhibitory drug when complement damage is at its peak which minimizes adverse effects from prolonged complement inhibition . Patients with NMO do not lack natural C1-esterase inhibitor , but artificially tipping the balance to suppress the complement pathways using purified human C1-esterase inhibitor in patients with hyperactive complement activation has been shown to be beneficial in myocardial infarction and sepsis . Similarly , the rationale for adding human C1-esterase inhibitor to the treatment for NMO acute exacerbations is to tip the balance toward complement suppression in an effort to reduce complement-mediated neurologic damage . This is a phase 1b open-label , interventional proof-of-concept study in which all subjects will receive 3 daily infusions of 2000 Units of intravenous CINRYZE at the onset of an NMO exacerbation , plus an additional 2 infusions of 1000 Units of intravenous CINRYZE during a second treatment phase with plasma exchange , if necessary .",2012-12-29,"July 17, 2014","Inclusion Criteria : Able and willing to provide written informed consent . 18-65 years of age .

BMSC have been used to treat graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) , a complication that can develop after stem cell transplants . BMSC have also been used to treat other post-transplant complications , like marrow failure or tissue injury . The National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) has developed a procedure for collecting and preserving BMSC from volunteer donors . These donors have passed tests to ensure that their cells are healthy enough to be used for treatment . Researchers want to use the collected cells to treat people with GVHD , marrow failure , or tissue injury following stem cell transplants . Objectives : - To test the safety and effectiveness of NIH-collected BMSC to treat complications from stem cell transplants . Eligibility : Individuals between 18 and 75 years of age who have complications from stem cell transplants . Complications are acute GVHD , poor bone marrow function , or tissue or organ damage . Design : Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history . They will also have imaging studies and blood tests . Participants will provide blood , skin , and bone marrow samples before the BMSC treatment . Additional samples , including tissue samples , will be collected after the start of treatment . Participants will have up to three BMSC infusions . There will be a week between each infusion . Participants will be monitored closely during each infusion . Any side effects will be treated . Treatment will be monitored with frequent blood tests and physical exams . After the end of the infusions , participants will have regular followup visits for up to 2 years .","Bone marrow stromal cells ( BMSC ) derived from bone marrow aspiration/biopsy have important anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties that make them suitable candidates for cellular therapy of inflammatory and degenerative disorders . BMSC suppress lymphocyte immune responsiveness and can hone in to sites of inflammation and promote healing . BMSC were first used in man to successfully treat refractory acute graft versus host disease ( aGVHD ) . A recent multicenter study treating refractory aGVHD reported a 66 % response rate and a sustained survival in responding patients . BMSC are currently being evaluated in acute GVHD in several ongoing studies worldwide . BMSC have also been used to treat post-transplant conditions not directly due to GVHD . Responses have been reported in hemorrhagic cystitis , and pneumoperitoneum . BMSC are also under evaluation in the treatment of inflammatory and autoimmune disorders . The Cell Processing Section of the Department of Transfusion Medicine at the Clinical Center NIH has developed a procedure for collecting , expanding and cryopreserving clinical grade BMSC under an FDA Drug Master File ( DMF ) . Marrow will be aspirated from volunteer donors participating on protocol 10-CC-0053 who have passed the standard screening for blood and marrow donors and BMSC will be expanded in vitro . Since it is not necessary to HLA-match BMSC donors with their recipient for this study , a BMSC repository will be used as the source of BMSC for this study . This will be the first trial of the safety of the NIH BMSC cellular product in stem cell transplant recipients . In this phase I study , open to adult NIH allogeneic stem cell transplantation ( SCT ) recipients , we will evaluate the safety of a fixed dose of BMSC infusions ( target dose of 2 x 106 BMSCs /kg ( +/- 10 % ) ) in patients with acute GVHD , marrow failure or tissue injury following allogeneic SCT . Up to three BMSC infusions will be given every 7 3 days apart . Safety will be monitored continuously with a stopping rule for toxicity based on the treatment-related serious adverse event rate .

Weill Medical College of Cornell University,NCT01632202,Seprafilm Slurry in the Prevention of Uterine Scarring in Patients Undergoing Hysteroscopic Myomectomy,Weill Medical College of Cornell University,4,0,Intrauterine Adhesions,Device,Seprafilm,Prevention,Single,"Seprafilm is an FDA-approved temporary bioresorbable barrier that physically separates opposing tissue surfaces . The physical presence of the membrane separates adhesiogenic tissue while the normal tissue repair process takes place . When used in the abdominopelvic cavity , it has been shown to reduce the incidence of adhesions . The intrauterine cavity is a potential space where the walls of the uterus are collapsed upon itself in the normal state . It has been demonstrated that the trauma of removing a submucosal fibroid with electrocautery exposes the uterus to great potential for intrauterine adhesions since the raw charred surface is directly opposed to the opposite endometrial surface . Previous studies have shown that the placement of hyaluronic acid in the intrauterine cavity after a myomectomy is not only safe , but also decreases the incidence of intrauterine adhesions . The investigators hypothesize that by placing a slurry of Seprafilm in the intrauterine cavity and creating a temporary physical barrier between the walls of the uterus , that they will be able to prevent iatrogenic intrauterine adhesions . Given that approximately 24 to 48 hours after placement , the membrane becomes a hydrated gel that is slowly resorbed within one week , the investigators anticipate that the patient will have minimal to no discomfort ; since no physical device is being left in the endometrial cavity , the uterus will not be contracting more than it does in its normal postoperative state .","The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial ( RCT ) involving patients at NewYork Presbyterian Hospital-Columbia University Medical Center and Weill Medical College of Cornell University . The investigators will enroll 328 pre- menopausal patients ( > 18years ) with documented submucosal myomas undergoing hysteroscopic myomectomy with monopolar resection in this study . The investigators anticipate that approximately 30 % of the patients undergoing myomectomy will form intrauterine adhesions and that administration of the Seprafilm slurry will reduce the incidence to approximately 15 % . Patients will be queried on post-operative days 1 , 7 , and 30 for pain/discomfort and the degree of intrauterine adhesions will be assessed after the patient 's second menses ( 75-90 days post procedure ) .",2012-06-28,"November 10, 2020","Inclusion Criteria : Reproductive aged women : Age 18-48 years old Non-pregnant Otherwise healthy Regular menstrual cycle Documented submucosal myomas ( one or more ) Undergoing hysteroscopic myomectomy Patients must have signed an informed consent .

National Institutes of Health Clinical Center (CC),NCT01631630,Role of Proinflammatory Signaling in Alcohol Craving,National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA),2,0,Alcohol Dependence,Drug,Pioglitazone,Treatment,Triple,"Background : - Drinking too much alcohol can injure cells in the body . Inflammation is the body s reaction to injured cells . Studies show that inflammation can cause cravings for alcohol . Researchers want to see if pioglitazone , a drug that decreases inflammation , can reduce alcohol craving . If so , it might help develop new ways to help alcoholics with craving . Objectives : - To see if pioglitazone can reduce alcohol craving . Eligibility : - Adults between 21 and 65 years of age who are alcoholic and have been drinking within the past month . Design : Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history . Blood samples will also be collected . All participants will have inpatient treatment at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center for the 5 weeks of the study . They will have standard treatment for alcoholism during their inpatient stay . Half of the people in this study will have pioglitazone . The other half will have a placebo . Participants will have different studies during their stay . These studies will include the following : Personalized audio recordings of stressful , alcohol-related , and neutral events to monitor mood Imaging studies to test alcohol cravings Questionnaires about mood and alcohol cravings Lumbar puncture to collect spinal fluid Inflammation test to see if the study drug can block alcohol cravings After the end of the 5-week study , all participants will be offered follow-up outpatient care through the Clinical Center , or referral to outside treatment .","Objective : The objective of the present study is to evaluate the role of proinflammatory signaling in alcohol craving . The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor y ( PPARy ) agonist pioglitazone , which modulates glial activity , will be used as an experimental treatment . Guided imagery auditory scripts will be used as an established set of stimuli to induce craving . Low dose lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) administration which activates proinflammatory signaling will be used as a novel challenge , and evaluated for its ability to provoke alcohol craving . If LPS in fact induces alcohol craving , the present design will allow evaluation of whether pioglitazone can inhibit this response . Study population : Up to 60 subjects will be recruited for a target accrual of 50 completers . Subjects will be aged 21-65 years , with alcohol dependence as their primary complaint , and without other serious medical or psychiatric conditions . They will be admitted to the NIAAA research inpatient unit at the NIH Clinical Research Center ( CRC ) through one of the screening protocols ( 05-AA-0121 Assessment and Treatment of People with Alcohol Drinking Problems ) or 14-AA-0181 `` Unit and Clinic Evaluations , Screening , Assessment , and Management '' ) which provides basic assessments and standard withdrawal treatment if needed . Design : Following inclusion , subjects will undergo interviews for construction of guided imagery scripts , and these scripts will subsequently be used as stress- , alcohol- or neutral condition associated stimuli . Subjects will be randomized to pioglitazone ( n=25 ; final dose : 45mg/daily ) or identically looking placebo ( n=25 ) . Following at least two weeks of treatment , subjects will undergo three sessions of guided imagery , on separate days and in a counter-balanced order , exposing them to the personalized stress- , alcohol- or neutral condition associated auditory scripts , respectively . During the final week , subjects will undergo two challenge sessions , a minimum of five days apart , with lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) or placebo , in counterbalanced order . Outcome measures : Subjective ratings of mood , anxiety and craving will be obtained twice weekly throughout the study . During the challenge sessions that utilize psychological stimuli or LPS , subjective ratings of craving for alcohol , as well as ratings of negative emotions will be obtained . Lumbar puncture will be performed and cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) obtained to determine the effect of pioglitazone on levels of proinflammatory cytokines . Neuroendocrine , psychological and physiological measures will be collected for exploratory purposes . An fMRI scan will be obtained to evaluate the effect of pioglitazone on BOLD signal in response to emotionally salient visual cues .",2012-06-27,"January 27, 2017","INCLUSION CRITERIA : Diagnostic and Statistical Manual ( DSM ) -IV diagnosis of alcohol dependence on Structured Clinical Interview for DSM Diagnosis ( SCID ) alcohol problems as primary complaint among substance use disorders , and alcohol use within the last month .

University of Birmingham,NCT01770678,A Trial Comparing Two Methods of CIMT in the Hemiplegic Child,University of Birmingham,2,1,Cerebral Palsy,Other,Constraint Induced Movement Therapy,Treatment,Single,"Cerebral palsy remains a major cause of lifelong disability affecting approximately 2 per 1,000 children . Of those about 30 % have hemiplegic cerebral palsy ( HPC ) , a unilateral impairment , which can often lead to major difficulties with manual dexterity and upper limb , functional ability and independence . Therapists employ a number of strategies in upper limb rehabilitation however they are poorly understood and their efficacy has been questioned . Constraint induced movement therapy ( CIMT ) has been found to be an effective intervention with HCP however its use in the preschool child within a national health service ( NHS ) setting has not been evaluated . The investigators aim is to compare CIMT using prolonged restraint with CIMT using brief manual restraint which may be standard practice and acts as the control . This age group has been targeted as there may be greatest neural plasticity ( change ) and minimal disruption to compulsory education . The investigators intend to recruit 60 patients from treatment databases of participating trusts . Patients will be randomised following baseline assessments which will include 2 upper limb assessments ( The Assisting Hand Assessment and the Quality of Upper Extremity Skills Test ) and a quality of life questionnaire ( PedsQL Generic Core Scales and the Cerebral Palsy Module ) for parents . The intervention period will be for 6 weeks offered intermittently ( 2week blocks ) over 10 weeks . Parents /guardians and possibly preschool workers will be expected to carry out a therapy guided programme . The amount of intervention and compliance will be recorded by parents/guardians and therapists . Assessments will be repeated at 10 weeks and 24 weeks from the beginning of the trial . The results of the trial will contribute to the evidence on the effectiveness of CIMT in the preschool child with HCP , and will also provide evidence on the implementation of CIMT delivery within the current NHS therapy services . .","Cerebral Palsy ( CP ) is the most common lifelong neurodisability with a prevalence of approximately 2 per 1000 children born in Europe . Hemiplegic cerebral palsy ( HCP ) is characterised by unilateral motor impairment and is present in around 30 % of all CP in the UK . The associated impairments of the arm and hand can cause lifelong major difficulties with manual dexterity and upper limb functional ability and independence . Elective non-use may add substantially to the problem as children may disregard their affected hand even when the actual motor loss is mild . This may lead to further impairment including increased muscle tone , reduced ranges of movement , weakness and delayed skeletal maturity.Physiotherapists and occupational therapists are routinely involved in the care of children with CP . They employ a number of strategies in upper limb rehabilitation . However , the lack of randomised controlled trials ( RCTs ) has meant that the effects of different upper limb treatments are not well understood . Also the efficacy of therapy has been questioned . Constraint induced movement therapy ( CIMT ) has its origins in behavioral research with primates conducted by Taub in the 1980s . It consists of the immobilisation of the unaffected upper limb , together with massed practice of the affected upper limb . It has been extensively tested with adults poststroke and has been found to be effective in improving patient centered and motor outcomes with improvement maintained for 24 months . A Cochrane review of CIMT in children with HCP ( 2007 ) with 2 RCTs ( n=49 ) and a case control study found that the evidence for the use of CIMT was promising but that there was a need for further evidence to support its use in practice.Additionally , Huang ( 2009 ) carried out a systematic review of 21 intervention studies of which 5 were RCTs ( n=114 ) on the use of CIMT in children with HCP and found positive support for it although there were recommendations for further research to provide information about the threshold of effective intensity and comparisons of different components in relation to specific children . The McMaster Centre for Child Disability Research describe the evidence for the use of CIMT with HCP as promising and rate it as an ' A ' although recommend that investigation is required to continue to evaluate its effectiveness and address ongoing questions . The aim of this study is to compare the use of CIMT in the preschool child in an NHS setting , using prolonged restraint ( splint/cast with a bandage to enclose the fingers ) with using brief manual restraint which may be used in current practice and acts as the control arm . The research proposal has been developed not only with scientific critique but also from input at all levels from service users ( parents ) whose children have already been involved with CIMT especially one who was the subject of a single case study carried out by the author . Design : A pragmatic , multicentered , blinded , individually randomised controlled trial . Baseline Assessment Three baseline assessments will be conducted prior to randomisation . The Assisting Hand Assessment ( AHA ) , developed for children aged 18 months to 5 years which is a well evaluated measure appropriate for hand function in hemiplegia will be carried out by the chief investigator ( CI ) . The AHA is administered in 2 steps . Firstly a DVD is made of a 1015 minute semistructured play session with the child using toys from the AHA kit which require bimanual activity . Using the DVD , the play session is then scored by a validated AHA scorer . The CI will carry out all of the recorded play sessions and will do some of the scoring along with another AHA validated scorer who is a therapist who works for another NHS trust . The CI will also assess the patient 's affected upper limb using the Quality Of Upper Extremity Skills Test ( QUEST ) which evaluates four domains : dissociated movement , grasp , protective extension , and weight bearing . This will provide evaluation of the severity of the underlying impairment and allow comparison with other studies . Parents/guardians will complete the PedsQL Generic Core Scales and the Cerebral palsy Module to assess the impact on quality of life . Randomisation will then be carried out using a standard method with adequate concealment . Analysis will be done on an intention to treat basis . Intervention Following randomisation the child will either be allocated to the control arm , which involves an episode of CIMT using brief manual restraint and therapy or to the intervention arm , which involves an episode of CIMT using prolonged restraint using a cast/splint and crepe bandage to enclose the fingers and therapy.Some parents/guardians may choose to put a sock over the restraint to keep it clean . Both methods will offer 6 weeks ( 42days ) of intervention over a 10 week period.It would be expected that this active period would start 2 weeks after randomisation and would be no later that 4 weeks after randomisation.This amount of intervention has been informed by previous CIMT studies in HCP and is in line with the amount of intervention which may be offered as an episode of care in standard practice . The control arm involves the unaffected hand being gently held so as not to be able to participate in an activity and encouraging the child to use their affected hand instead . This therapy would be guided by the therapist but would be carried out mainly by parents/guardians and when the child attends nursery by the nursery workers . The support from the nursery workers is what may be expected in usual practice . The therapy would be expected to last for approximately one hour per day . It is not necessary for this time to be continuous if meal times are included most parents/guardians should be able to accomplish this . NHS REC Form Reference : 10/H1207/36 IRAS Version 2.5 Date : 30/03/2010 7 47136/110912/1/802 randomisation and would be no later that 4 weeks after randomisation.This amount of intervention has been informed by previous CIMT studies in HCP and is in line with the amount of intervention which may be offered as an episode of care in standard practice . The control arm involves the unaffected hand being gently held so as not to be able to participate in an activity and encouraging the child to use their affected hand instead . This therapy would be guided by the therapist but would be carried out mainly by parents/guardians and when the child attends nursery by the nursery workers . The support from the nursery workers is what may be expected in usual practice . The therapy would be expected to last for approximately one hour per day . It is not necessary for this time to be continuous if meal times are included most parents/guardians should be able to accomplish this . The intervention arm involves restraining the unaffected hand using a belowelbow splint/cast and crepe bandage.Some parents/guardians may choose to put a sock over the restraint to keep it clean . The restraint is used to limit the activity of unaffected hand . The therapy implemented at the same time , to encourage the use of the affected hand , would be offered in exactly the same way as in the control arm . Using a belowelbow method of prolonged restraint , allows the unaffected upper limb to continue to participate to a degree in bimanual activities , therefore is less intrusive to the child . In addition using a splint/cast and bandage is relatively nonstigmatising as children with splints/casts and bandage are not an unusual event in society . With regard to the prolonged restraint we would aim that parents/guardians persist with this and although it may take time for the child to adjust to it , it would be expected that with appropriate attention to tasks this could be achieved . However , if the child is completely unaccepting of the prolonged restraint , it may be that after approximately three/four days , following discussion between the therapist and parents/guardians a recommendation may be made to discontinue with the prolonged restraint but continue with the therapy . Setting The research will be carried out in the setting where the patients receive their usual treatment either at home or in a local clinic . Prolonged restraint will be applied in a local clinic . Outcome measures Primary outcome measure : The primary outcome measure will be a change in AHA at 10 weeks after trial entry and will be carried out by the CI who will be blind to patient allocation and some of the scoring will be carried out by a validated AHA scorer working for another trust who will be blind to allocation . Secondary Measures : A change in the AHA at 24 weeks after trial entry will be carried out by the CI who will be blind to patient allocation and some of the scoring will be carried out by a validated AHA scorer working for another trust who will be blind to allocation . A change in the QUEST at 10 weeks and 24 weeks after trial entry which will be carried out by the CI . A change in the the PedsQL Generic Core Scales and the Cerebral Palsy Module at 10 weeks and 24 weeks after trial entry which will be carried out by parents/guardians . During the intervention parents/guardians , nursery workers and therapists will be asked to collect information about the acceptability and compliance of the restraint and therapy . Recruitment : Target population : Patients from the participating trusts children 's services directorate treatment databases , who fulfill the inclusion and exclusion criteria , will be identified by their treating therapists , and approached by them . Inclusion/exclusion All eligible children with HCP aged 18months9 months before starting compulsory education will be included . The intervention is targeted to preschool children who would have the most potential to benefit ( neural plasticity may be greatest ) and least disruptive to their compulsory education . The maximum age is 9 months before the child starts compulsory education which allows those children randomised to the control arm the possibility of having an episode of prolonged CIMT if requested by parents/guardians before they start compulsory education . Exclusion criteria include : Where there is a skin condition present which may cause problems with splinting/ casting If there is some abnormal neurological involvement in both upper limbs Clinical presentation of athetosis/ dystonia If the child has received > 2 weeks of prolonged restraint using a cast/splint within the last 6 months . Consent Consent from parents/guardians will be gained prior to inclusion . Parents/guardians of prospective patients will be given a full explanation of the trial by the treating therapist or by the principal investigator ( PI ) who will understand the ethical principles underpinning informed consent . Discussion will include the reason the research is being carried out , information about the treatment options , the risks and benefits and the manner of the treatment allocation . They will be given a patient information sheet to read and sufficient time to decide whether they would like to join the trial . Simple explanations about the intervention will be given to the children within the limits of their understanding . Parents/guardians will then be asked to sign a consent form by a different therapist where possible who is part of the clinical care team . If support is needed from an interpreter this will be provided . It will be made clear that if they do not take part this will not affect their treatment in any way . Specific consent will be gained for making , posting and storing the DVDs which are part of the AHA assessment . Risks and benefits A risk assessment of the trial has been performed which included consultation with parents/guardians of children who have already been involved with CIMT . The CIMT interventions are considered to be of low risk .

Risks and benefits A risk assessment of the trial has been performed which included consultation with parents/guardians of children who have already been involved with CIMT . The CIMT interventions are considered to be of low risk . The risks identified include : The children allocated to the intervention arm may become frustrated leading to an increase in poor behavior as they are not able to use their unaffected hand . Every effort will be made to keep this to a minimum through providing appropriate toys and advice on activity . Clear guidelines are available to therapists and parents/guardians to respond to this . The method chosen for prolonged restraint is removable and parents/guardians will have instructions for removing the splint/cast if needed and emergency contact numbers.If there is total noncompliance by the child , after three /four days a decision may be made between the therapist and parent/guardian to discontinue . The skin on the upper limb which is restrained for a prolonged period may become red and sore . At worse this could become blistered . This will be highlighted to parents/guardians . It would be expected that if this was the case the child would complain and parents/guardians would be able to remove the restraint . As the splint/cast is removable the skin condition can be checked . The unaffected upper limb while restrained may be less effective in saving reactions . The method of restraint chosen is below elbow to keep this to a minimum . However there may be an increase in risk of injury from falling over . This risk is kept to a minimum by highlighting it to parents/guardians and advising to limit situations which would be especially challenging to balance or offering supervision in these situations . Adverse events will be recorded by the therapists and will also be recorded in the same way as an adverse event occurring as an NHS patient . Those patients who are randomised to the CIMT using brief manual restraint ( control arm ) whose parents/guardians request an episode of CIMT with prolonged restraint ( intervention arm ) will be offered this at the end of the trial before compulsory education begins . Confidentiality Members of the direct clinical care team will have access to personidentifiable information as in their usual practice . This trial will not use person identifiable data but instead unique identifiers will be used . Any data generated as part of the research will be stored securely . DVDs of the participants will be made as part of the AHA assessment . All DVDs will be encrypted to the standard recommended by the NHS and stored in a locked cupboard . Some of the DVDs produced as part of the AHA will be posted to another NHS trust using a tracking service to be scored by a therapist who is a validated AHA scorer.Secure storage will be provided by this trust . Parents/guardians will be informed about the transfer and asked to consent to this . All data will be stored in a secure cupboard for 5 years after the end of the trial and will then be destroyed .",2012-06-19,"January 17, 2013",Inclusion Criteria : Diagnosis of hemiplegic cerebral palsy Aged between 18 months and 4 years ( 9 months before compulsory education begins ) .

For the last 60 years corticosteroids have been the backbone of the treatment of lupus nephritis but they are associated with significant toxicity . Although randomized placebo controlled trials of Rituximab in non-renal lupus and lupus nephritis did not meet their primary end-points , there is accumulating data that suggests that B cell depletion with Rituximab may be efficacious in lupus disease refractory to conventional therapy . Furthermore , our pilot data suggests that the addition of Rituximab to mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) without oral steroids is at least as effective at inducing a renal response as the standard of care therapy comprising MMF and high dose oral corticosteroids . RITUXILUP is a proof of concept , open labeled , randomized , controlled , multicentre trial that aims to demonstrate whether the addition of Rituximab to MMF therapy is useful in treating a new flare of lupus nephritis and whether it has a long lasting steroid-sparing , beneficial effect with equal efficacy and greater safety than a conventional regimen of MMF and oral prednisolone .

Hyperinflation is easily detected by measuring lung volumes during standard pulmonary function testing . Decreased Inspiratory Capacity ( IC ) secondary to hyperinflation has been described as a predictor of mortality in COPD , and as a limiting factor for the maximal tidal volume attained during exercise . Hyperinflation has been linked to a low cardiac output in part by limiting left ventricular ejection fraction during exercise . Treatment with inhaled anticholinergic agents or long-acting beta agonists ( LABA ) and combination of the LABA formoterol and budesonide has been shown to improve IC and decrease lung hyperinflation . Bronchodilators have been shown to improve exercise endurance in COPD when combined with pulmonary rehabilitation , however the exact mechanism : improvement of lung mechanics and /or improvement in cardiac function is not well known . Impedance cardiography ( ICG ) has emerged as a method to measure cardiac output without the need for invasive devices . Cardiac output measurement by impedance cardiography ( CO-ICG ) is a valid and reproducible method . It has been shown to have good correlation with thermodilution and the direct Fick method for the measurement of stroke volume and cardiac output . In addition , the oxygen pulse , easily obtained by dividing the measured oxygen uptake by the heart rate ( VO2/HR ) provides an adequate reflection of cardiac stroke volume when the systemic extraction of oxygen is stable . This method has been used to evaluate the effect of static and dynamic hyperinflation on cardiac function . This pilot study is designed to be a single center ( Brigham and Women 's Hospital ) , randomized , placebo-controlled , double blind , crossover study of 14 patients ( male and female 40 to 80 years old ) with COPD and static hyperinflation . The primary endpoint is the measurement of stroke volume , cardiac output and oxygen pulse at rest before and after the administration of budesonide/formoterol compared to placebo .",2012-10-23,"May 18, 2017","Inclusion Criteria : Outpatients subjects of either sex between ages 40-80 years , with a diagnosis of COPD .

Subjects with varying degrees of renal insufficiency ( i.e . kidney function ) will be included in the study . Tirofiban is known to be cleared from the blood by the kidneys and so people with kidney problems clear tirofiban to a slower extent compared to people without kidney problems . By comparing the tirofiban concentration profile between subjects with healthy kidney function versus with impaired kidney function , a tirofiban dosing recommendation for subjects with impaired kidney function can be made . This is a non-randomized , single-center , open-label study . A single dose of tirofiban ( 25 µg/kg administered intravenously over a 3 min period ) will be administered to subjects with normal renal function ( > 90 mL/min CrCl ) , moderate ( 30-59 mL/min CrCl ) , and severe ( < 30 mL/min CrCl ) renal impairment with non-dialysis-dependent renal insufficiency","Tirofiban is cleared from the plasma largely by renal excretion . As a consequence , a dosage adjustment of 50 % of the tirofiban label dosing regimen ( 0.4 μg/kg/min for a period of 30 minutes , followed by an infusion of 0.10 μg/kg/min ) is recommended in patients with severe renal impairment ( < 30 mL/min CrCl ) , including those who require hemodialysis . The dosage adjustment for the tirofiban high-dose bolus regimen ( 25 μg/kg bolus followed by a 0.15 μg/kg/min maintenance ) for patients with varying degrees of renal insufficiency is however unknown .

Stanford University,NCT01624194,Intranasal Oxytocin Treatment for Social Deficits in Children With Autism,Stanford University,2,1,Autism,Drug,Oxytocin nasal spray,Treatment,Quadruple,"Autism is a pervasive developmental disorder characterized by core deficits in social behavior and communication , and the presence of repetitive or stereotyped behaviors . It is one of three recognized disorders in the autism spectrum which affects an estimated 1 in 88 children in the United States . At present , pharmacotherapies target only associated features of autism , with no effective drug treatments for the social impairments . Several lines of evidence now suggest that the neuropeptide oxytocin ( OT ) may be an effective treatment for the core social deficits in autism . Here we will test the effects of twice daily intranasal OT ( 24 IU ) over a 4-week period for enhancing social deficits in male and female children aged 6-12 years with autism . This research has high potential to lead to the development of more effective treatments and earlier interventions for children with autism .","In recent years , the neuropeptide oxytocin ( OT ) has been implicated in a wide range of social behaviors including attachment bonds , emotion recognition , eye gaze to social cues , and memory for social information . Social impairments represent one of the most intractable features of autism , and evidence now suggests that OT biology is dysregulated in individuals with this disorder . The central aim of the research outlined here is to test whether OT administration to children with autism increases their quality and quantity of social interactions and enhances their ability to process emotional and social information . Findings from initial single-dose OT administration studies in teenaged and adult males with autism have shown improvement in some aspects of social functioning , but replication and extension to well-controlled treatment trials with younger male and female subjects is necessary to evaluate effectiveness . We therefore aim to investigate the effect of intranasal OT on social cognition and behavior immediately following a single-dose ( 24IU ) and following a 4-week period of OT ( 24IU BID ) administration in a sample of 50 subjects with autism aged 6 to 12 years . The primary outcome for this study is change in social behavior , as determined by parent ratings on the Social Responsiveness Scale ( SRS ) after the 4-week treatment period . Secondary outcomes are changes in functioning on laboratory-based measures of social behavior and cognition following single-dose and 4-week OT administration . Research in a small study sample ( N=13 ) also identified treatment responders and non-responders to a single-dose of OT . Thus , we also aim to identify biological and cognitive and behavioral variables ( i.e. , pretreatment levels of social functioning and pretreatment plasma hormone levels ) that may influence treatment response efficacy in our larger study sample . On completion of the 4-week treatment period all subjects will have the option of participating in another 4-week double-blind trial in which they will be switched to the alternate nasal spray to that which they previously received . They will then undergo a fourth and final assessment time-point using the same testing procedures as outlined above on completion of the 4-week dosing . By providing subjects with the option of participating in a second 4-week treatment trial , all subjects will have an opportunity to receive the active oxytocin nasal spray . We also will be able to examine any ongoing effects of oxytocin treatment in the group receiving placebo during the second 4-week administration period . Subjects not willing to take part in the second trial will exit the study and will be referred to their treating physician .",2012-06-18,"July 12, 2019","Inclusion Criteria : Medically healthy outpatients between 6 and 12 years of age ( cut off 12 years and 11 months ) Intelligence Quotient > 40 Diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder based on the Autism Diagnostic Interview - Revised , Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule , and DSM-IV criteria Clinical Global Impression severity rating of 4 or higher Care provider who can reliably bring subject to clinic visits , provide trustworthy ratings , and interacts with the subject on a regular basis Stable medications for at least 4 weeks No planned changes in psychosocial interventions during the trial Willingness to provide blood samples .

Common clinical manifestations include menstrual irregularities and signs of androgen excess such as hirsutism , acne , and alopecia . Metformin , a biguanide , is the most widely used drug for the treatment of type 2 diabetes worldwide . Its primary action is to inhibit hepatic glucose production , but it also increases the sensitivity of peripheral tissues to insulin . The increase in insulin sensitivity , which contributes to the efficacy of metformin in the treatment of diabetes , has also been shown in non diabetic women with the polycystic ovary syndrome.In women with PCOS , long-term treatment with metformin may increase ovulation , improve menstrual cyclicity , and reduce serum androgen levels ; the use of metformin may also improve hirsutism . If published data on the effects of metformin in the prevention of diabetes can be extrapolated to women with the PCOS , then the drug may actually retard progression to glucose intolerance in affected women , as reported in a small , retrospective study . Ultrasonic vibrations spread in the form of a wave in medium such as a liquid or a solid . When the particles of an elastic medium are under ultrasonic vibration , they act continuously in only one direction . The lipolytic range of ultrasounds is 30-70 Kilohertz ( KHz ) , and the best effects are obtained in a range between30-35 KHz . The depth of the treatment in the tissues is generally2-3 cm , to avoid muscles involvement . Biological effects of ultrasounds on adipocytes are : micro-mechanical , thermal , micro-streaming and cavitation .

Centre hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal (CHUM),NCT01627717,The Effects of the Direct Acting Antiviral Agent Boceprevir on the Pharmacokinetics of Maraviroc in Healthy Volunteers,Centre hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal (CHUM),1,1,Healthy,Drug,Maraviroc (5 days),Basic Science,,"Infection by both HIV and hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) is frequent due to similar transmission modes . Near 20 % of people living with HIV are also infected by HCV . People living with HIV are treated by anti-HIV medications that may interact with numerous other medications , including new medications against HCV . Boceprevir is one of these new HCV medications and it is now considered as part of the standard of care for people infected with HCV . Previous research has shown boceprevir may influence the capacity of the liver to breakdown ( metabolize ) certain medications and when these medications are used in combination with boceprevir , their blood concentrations may be increased or decreased which could increase the risk of side effects or decrease efficacy . Among the drugs having a potential for an interaction with boceprevir is maraviroc , an anti-HIV medication . If concentrations of maraviroc increase , people may experience more side effects . However , if concentrations of maraviroc decrease , people living with HIV may have a lower suppression of the virus . This could increase the risk for the HIV virus to develop resistance , that is that the treatment will no longer be effective . No studies have been conducted to investigate the effects of boceprevir on blood concentrations of maraviroc . This research project addresses this research question . This project , however , can not be done with people living with HIV since resistance may develop in these people if the concentrations of maraviroc decrease . It is for this reason that the investigators wish to recruit healthy people not infected with HIV nor HCV . Eleven healthy volunteers will be included . They will receive maraviroc 150 mg ( 1 tablet ) every 12 hours from days 1 to 19 inclusively . On day 5 , a total of ten blood samples will be drawn during the following 12 hours ( at 0 , 0.5 , 1 , 1.5 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 8 and 12 hours after maraviroc morning dose intake ) to measure the blood concentrations of maraviroc . Boceprevir 800 mg ( 4 capsules ) every 8 hours with food will be started on day 6 and continued until day 19 inclusively . On day 19 , after the morning maraviroc and boceprevir dose , another ten blood samples will be drawn over a 12 hour period . A phone follow-up will be done on day 26 . Thus , the total study duration for subjects is 26 days . The investigators will compare the blood concentrations of maraviroc when given alone to the blood concentrations of maraviroc when given with boceprevir .","Co-infection with human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) and hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) is frequent because of shared modes of viral transmission . Near 20 % of HIV-infected patients are also infected with HCV , the prevalence of HCV in the HIV population varying according to the route of transmission . Despite the decrease in mortality and morbidity in HIV-infected individuals since the introduction of potent combination antiretroviral therapy ( cART ) , HCV-related end-stage liver disease ( ESLD ) now represents a leading cause of death in these patients . HCV treatment outcomes in terms of sustained virologic response ( SVR ) are usually worse in co-infected patients , pegylated interferon-alpha ( PEG IFN-alpha ) / ribavirin treatment leading to success in only 40 to 50 % of mono-infected patients and 30 % of co-infected patients . In patients co-infected with HIV , present guidelines recommend a fixed course of PEG IFN-alpha / ribavirin for 48 weeks to optimize HCV treatment . The recent introduction of boceprevir and telaprevir , two direct acting antiviral agents ( DAAs ) against HCV , changed the standard of care for the treatment of chronic HCV infection with genotype 1 , whereby now the AASLD practice guidelines recommend the use of boceprevir or telaprevir in combination with PEG IFN-alpha/ribavirin in both HCV mono-infected treatment naïve and experienced patients . No studies have yet been published in HCV-HIV co-infected patients . Boceprevir is a novel HCV NS3 serine protease inhibitor ( PI ) . In clinical studies of treatment-naïve and experienced patients , this agent , in combination with standard of care ( PEG IFN-alpha/ribavirin ) , achieved much greater SVR rates , reaching rates higher than 70 % in clinical studies . Boceprevir has to be taken 800 mg ( four 200 mg capsules ) three times a day ( every 7-9 hours ) with food . Boceprevir is usually well tolerated according to single and multiple dose pharmacokinetics studies in healthy volunteers with adverse effects similar to placebo . The serious adverse effects related to boceprevir are seen when boceprevir is coadministered with PEG-IFN alpha/ribavirin . These include anemia , neutropenia and thrombocytopenia . An interim analysis of a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study of the use of boceprevir/PEG IFN-alpha/ribavirin in HCV treatment naïve HCV/HIV co-infected patients showed that 70.5 % of patients on boceprevir/PEG IFN-alpha/ribavirin had an undetectable HCV RNA at 24 weeks as compared to 34.4 % of patients on PEG IFN-alpha/ribavirin . Boceprevir metabolism is mediated mainly by aldo-keto reductases and by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 . Boceprevir is also a substrate of p-glycoprotein ( P-gp ) . Boceprevir is by itself known to be a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4/3A5 and drugs metabolized by this pathway may have increased exposure when administered with this product . In vitro data has shown that boceprevir does not induce CYP3A4/5 . Surprisingly , however , a recent warning by the FDA ( FDA Medwatch , February 9th 2012 ) and a Dear Health Care Professional Letter from Merck & Co , Inc. ( USA ) have revealed that boceprevir decreases the exposure of HIV ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors that are CYP3A4 substrates . This unpublished data suggests that boceprevir in vivo may be acting as a CYP3A4 inducer . Contradictory in vitro and in vivo drug interaction study results are not uncommon . The clinical impact of these interactions is at the moment unclear . This has implications for possible drug-drug interactions if boceprevir is used in combination with cART in HIV/HCV co-infected patients . Among the antiretroviral drugs that seem promising to be used in HIV/HCV co-infected patients is maraviroc . A recent conference abstract suggests that adding maraviroc to an antiretroviral regimen in HIV/HCV-co-infected patients naïve to anti-HCV therapy decreases liver fibrosis . Maraviroc is usually given as 300 mg twice daily with or without food but the dose may change depending on the patient 's concomitant medications . Maraviroc does not inhibit any of the major CYP450 enzymes ( CYP1A2 , CYP2B6 , CYP2C8 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 ) and does not show any effects on plasma concentrations of other molecules . Maraviroc 's major metabolic routes are oxidation and N-dealkylation and in vitro studies demonstrated that maraviroc is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 . Concomitant use of maraviroc with known CYP3A4 inhibitors requires maraviroc dosage to be reduced to 150 mg twice a day while its use with CYP3A4 inducers necessitates maraviroc to be used 600 mg twice daily . Maraviroc was well tolerated in the various clinical trials with a drop-out rate of 4 to 6 % similar to placebo . The most common side effects are upper respiratory tract infections ( 22,8 % ) , cough ( 13,8 % ) , fever ( 12,9 % ) , rash ( 10,8 % ) , muscle-related symptoms ( 9,9 % ) , dizziness and postural dizziness ( 8,7 % ) , abdominal pain ( 8.2 % ) , insomnia ( 7,7 % ) and constipation ( 5,9 % ) ( 19 ) . Maraviroc should be used with caution in patients with an increased risk of cardiovascular events as cases of myocardial infarction , postural hypotension and syncope have been reported . Postural hypotension is dose-related and unlikely to occur at labeled doses . However , postural hypotension may be of concern if drug-drug interactions occur without proper dose adjustments of maraviroc . The use of maraviroc 150 mg BID in steady-state drug-drug interaction studies in healthy volunteers in the presence of potent CYP3A4 inhibitors has been well tolerated . No study regarding the use of maraviroc with boceprevir has been conducted . Given the similar metabolic routes taken by these molecules , that is CYP3A4 , it is likely that these molecules will interact . It is unknown if boceprevir will increase or decrease maraviroc systemic exposure . To limit potential toxicity and study discontinuations , however , we have chosen to do the study with maraviroc 150 mg twice daily . The study will evaluate the effects of boceprevir on the pharmacokinetics of maraviroc in healthy volunteers . As maraviroc does not inhibit nor induce CYP 450 isoenzymes , maraviroc is not expected to influence boceprevir pharmacokinetics . For this reason , we have chosen not to measure boceprevir concentrations . This is a phase 1 , single center , open-label , crossover single-sequence drug-drug interaction study in healthy Caucasian males . The study population is limited to Caucasian males to limit interpatient pharmacokinetic variability . Eleven healthy volunteers will be included . They will receive maraviroc 150 mg every 12 hours from days 1 to 19 inclusively . On day 5 , 12 hour intensive pharmacokinetic sampling will be done to measure maraviroc in the absence of boceprevir .

University of Zurich,NCT01628484,Physiological Study to Determine the Allergic Skin Activity After Different Skin Preparation,University of Zurich,1,1,Birch Pollen Allergy,Other,prick lancet,Treatment,,"The objectives of this monocentric investigator initiated exploratory clinical trial is to optimize allergen delivery across the epidermal barrier . The cornified outer epidermal layers represent the main barrier towards entry into the viable epidermal layers . In the latter we aim to target the allergen for uptake by professional antigen presenting cells , called Langerhans cells . At the same time as little allergen as possible should be delivered to the dermis . The latter contains a high density of sensitized mast cells eliciting local reactions and also a high density of blood vessels which could lead to systemic distribution of allergen and therefore to systemic allergic reactions . In birch pollen allergic individuals we will compare different methods of preparing the skin before application of the allergen . We will subsequently apply titrated allergen doses to the prepared skin areas to determine at which dose we start observing mast cell degranulation manifesting as hives . This will allow for determination of the maximal tolerated allergen dose for each skin preparation method . The skin preparation methods compared will be : Single pricking with prick lancet ( Entaco LTD. , Redditch , Worcestershire , UK , distributed by Stallergenes® ) . Tape stripping with conventional adhesive Tape ( Tesa-film® ) . Microchanneling with Micro Needle Patch ( Micro Skin System , 3M® ) . The methods are strongly connected to routine diagnostics of allergies with low risk associated . The clinical trial protocol has been submitted to the local Ethics Committee . This comparison of skin preparation methods and the determination of the maximal tolerated allergen dose will help us to further improve epicutaneous allergen immunotherapy , which has the potential to make allergen specific immunotherapy not only considerably shorter and safer , but also more convenient for patients . Skin preparation by microneedle patches is significantly less painful than conventional injection and can be self administered . This should help improve the acceptance of allergen specific immunotherapy , as well as treatment compliance .","BACKGROUND INFORMATION The prevalence of allergic diseases has been continuously increasing , reaching a prevalence of up to 30 % in industrialized countries . In Switzerland , about 2 million people are affected by IgE-mediated allergies as reported by the Swiss Center for Allergy , Skin and Asthma and the Swiss Society for Allergology and Immunology ( SSAI ) . By subcutaneous injections of gradually increasing allergen doses , conventional subcutaneous SIT ( SCIT ) is found to reduce the inappropriate T-helper ( Th ) 2 responses and IgE production . Due to the risk of systemic allergic side effects , the typical therapy duration of 3-5 years and the requirement of 50-80 injections , patient acceptance of SCIT is low and less than 5 % of allergy patients choose to undergo SCIT . A recently rediscovered route of allergen administration is via the epidermis in a procedure called epicutaneous immunotherapy ( EPIT ) . The skin is an attractive administration route for immunotherapy being both easily accessible as well as playing an important role in the immune system consisting of keratinocytes , Langerhans cells ( LC ) , dermal dendritic cells ( DC ) . A major challenge in EPIT is to overcome the physiological barrier function of the skin . In order to deliver the allergen to the immunological effector cells in the skin , the allergen must be transported through the outermost keratinized layer of the epidermis , called the stratum corneum . The stratum corneum is 10-20μm thick and impermeable for molecules greater than 500 Da . Proteins , such as allergens , do not passively permeate across the skin and therefore enhancement strategies are needed to enable this transfer . Advances in microtechnology might contribute to improve the situation by allowing for the miniaturization of mechanics and structures . As the stratum corneum is only 10-20μm thick , it has been proposed by Henry et al. , that microneedles as small as a few tens to a few hundreds of microns , could be used to penetrate the stratum corneum . Such new methods of overcoming the skin barrier raise the question of the influence of different types of skin injury patterns on the allergic skin reactivity . Namely , how important is the role of the exposed area ( microneedles ) , the depth of injury ( skin pricking ) and the keratinocyte activation . This physiological question is in the focus of this study . PRODUCTS In order to investigate the physiological reactions concerning different skin conditions and allergen exposition the following products/techniques have been chosen for the purpose of inducing different skin conditions in a reproducible way . Prick lancet : For the pricking skin preparation , sterile prick lancets for 1mm point skin testing will be used : prick lancet , produced by Entaco LTD. , Redditch , Worcestershire , UK and distributed by Stallergenes® . They are used for allergy diagnostics in daily routine . Adhesive tape : For the tape stripping skin preparation a conventional tape will be used ( Tesafilm® ) . Microneedle array : To induce a large number of microchannels with a maximal depth of 150μm into the cornea layer , the solid Microstructured Transdermal System ( sMTS ) by 3M® will be used . This system is a small patch of 351 tiny needles , which is on the market in the US and is intended for preparing the skin for transdermal application of topical dermatology products . Epicutaneous allergen solution : For the epicutaneous administration four ten-fold serial dilutions ( 10 HEP , 1 HEP , 0.1 HEP and 0.01HEP/ml ) of registered allergen extracts of birch pollen ( Betula verrucosa ) ( Soluprick® , ALK-Abelló A/S , Hørsholm , Denmark ) will be used as in everyday allergy diagnostic practice . Histamine as positive control will be used at 10 mg/ml and a solution containing only the excipients will serve as negative control . This is an open-label physiological investigation of the allergic skin reactivity to epicutaneous allergen exposition in allergic patients comparing different methods of skin preparation . The focus of the study is on the skin preparation and not on the specific allergen or allergy , but for reasons of homogeneity a single allergic disease , birch pollen allergy was chosen as the basis for the testing . In order to evaluate the effects of the different skin preparation techniques an intra-individual comparison of the skin reactivity in terms of the immediate phase I reaction to serial dilutions of birch pollen extracts was chosen . The serial dilution approach allows a dose dependent effect evaluation and determination of the mean allergen concentration yielding similar skin reactions - thus differences will be explained mainly by the different skin preparation allowing a quantitative comparison of these techniques . HYPOTHESIS We will determine which of the three different skin preparation techniques uses higher protein concentration of allergen preparation ( Ch10 ) eliciting a wheal area of the same size as histamine 10 mg/ml will be calculated . The Null hypothesis therefore would be : Ch10 is not significantly different between the three skin preparation techniques .",2012-06-22,"November 6, 2012","Inclusion criteria : Written informed consent 18-65 years old ( male and female ) A positive clinical history for inhalant allergy presumably due to birch pollen Positive screening prick test ( mean wheal diameter = 3mm ) to birch pollen allergen solution A mean wheal size of = 7mm2 obtained in the screening prick test with histamine dihydrochloride ( 10mg/ml ) Exclusion criteria : Impaired in understanding the nature , meaning and scope of the study or incapable of giving written informed consent Participation in another clinical trial within the last 30 days and during the present study Pregnancy or nursing Positive skin reaction in the screening prick test to NaCl Currently suffering from allergy symptoms History of systemic reactions to allergens Severe diseases influencing the results of the present study by discretion of the investigator Immunotherapy with the allergen preparation during the past two years Skin lesions and excessive hair-growth in the skin test areas Treatment with prohibited concomitant medications , with the exception of medications with local effects which will not influence the results of the skin prick tests Alcohol or drug abuse",20,0,18 Years,65 Years
University of Nottingham,NCT01622972,Mode of Action of Moviprep,University of Nottingham,4,1,Functional Constipation,Drug,Polyethyleneglycol,Basic Science,,"The University of Nottingham have been developing new , non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) techniques to image the bowel . Building on those studies the investigators want to study , in healthy volunteers , the effects of purging on the colon . The investigators plan two studies using their novel MRI techniques in healthy volunteers to demonstrate how doses of a preparation designed to clean the bowel alters small and large bowel water content and transit . The investigators will also define the changes induced in colonic microbiota and how these are linked to changes in transit and the structure of colonic contents . This experimental model is comparable to an episode of acute diarrhea , therefore this study will also improve their understanding of the effects of diarrhea on bowel physiology . Following from the above study , the investigators would like to extend this study on patients who have functional constipation and previously have not responded to conventional laxatives .","Routine examinations of the colon including colonoscopy and barium enema widely carried out in clinical practice require evacuation of colonic contents . This is most conveniently carried out using osmotic laxatives the most widely used preparation being based on polyethylene glycol such as Moviprep . When fully made up as 1 litre of Moviprep , it provides 100 grams of polyethlene glycol '3350 ' with a measured osmolarity of around 530 mosmol/l . Being nonnutrient , this would be expected to rapidly leave the stomach and generate a substantial inflow of fluid in the upper small intestine as water flows down the osmotic gradient markedly increasing the small intestinal water content compared with fasting . Previous MRI studies using a Mannitol solution of 300 mosmols/l resulted in a small bowel secretion of fluid increasing total small bowel water to nearly 400 mls after a 300 ml meal . The investigators would anticipate a much larger increase after the hypertonic Moviprep . The flush of small bowel fluid induced by mannitol produces a radical change in the heterogeneous structure of the ascending colon as shown in our recent MRI images of the colon before and after mannitol . Contrary to expectation colonic contents are far from homogenous with a spatially organised bacterial flora which others have described at a microscopic level which the investigators are just beginning to demonstrate using their novel MRI techniques . The colon should be regarded as a complex bioreactor which is spatially highly organised with a mucous layer overlying the enterocytes , the outer layer of mucus containing a germinal layer with bacteria which reseed the bioreactor when it is purged . The rate of recovery after purgation with polyethylene glycol is said to be normally rapid as the intact germinal layer rapidly recolonises but slower in certain patient groups though data is very limited as yet . The anecdotal yet persuasive patient accounts of improvement in bowel function after colonic lavage suggest that the reconstituted microbiota may be different , though this has yet to be studied using modern techniques . Until recently the investigators have had no way of noninvasive imaging this complex structure but recent developments of high resolution MRI in Nottingham show that this is now feasible . Pilot data demonstrates that purging removes the heterogeneous three dimensional structure leaving homogeneous fluid contents with an intense proton signal . Just how this impacts on the colonic microbiota is as yet unknown as there have been no studies to date combining these novel approaches with new techniques now available for assessing the microbiota . Early culture-based assessments identify only a minority of all the faecal organisms present and it is only in the last decade that methods based on assessment of microbial DNA have evolved to make it possible to describe the full complexity of the faecal microbiota . PCR of the highly conserved 16s ribosomal RNA gene shows the microbiota of individuals to be highly complex and individualised . Similarity indices show similarities of around two thirds over a 7 week period in healthy controls while those developing acute diarrhoea due to radiation enteritis show a marked reduction to just 26 % . Similarly , HITChip analysis showed that subjects with IBS had an unstable microbiota that was stabilised following a probiotic intervention trial that improved the IBS symptom score . These techniques have yet to be applied to subjects undergoing bowel purgation . Moreover , there are novel approaches to identify the viability of the microbiota such as the use of specific probes that allow discrimination between intact , damaged and dead cells in fecal samples .",2012-06-15,"April 11, 2014","Inclusion Criteria Group 1 and 2 : Male or female healthy volunteers who are 18-65 years BMI 18-28 kg/m2 Able to give voluntary written informed consent to participate in the study Able to understand the requirements of the study , including anonymous publication , and agree to co-operate with the study procedures Inclusion Criteria Group 3 : Male or female who are 18-65 years BMI 18-30 kg/m2 Able to give voluntary written informed consent to participate in the study Able to understand the requirements of the study , including anonymous publication , and agree to co-operate with the study procedures Patient diagnosed with constipation predominant irritable bowel syndrome who failed to respond to at least 1 laxative treatment in the past Patient diagnosed with functional constipation who failed to respond to 1-2 sachets of Movicol per day Exclusion Criteria for group 1 and 2 : Any history of serious acute or chronic illness especially gastrointestinal Diabetes Mellitus Pregnancy or breast feeding Smoking Unsuitable for MRI scanning ( i.e . have metal implants or a pace maker ) Regular use of medication interfering with gastrointestinal function including opiates or constipating drugs Subjects using the oral contraceptive pill will be excluded if not prepared to use an alternative barrier method of contraception for the duration of the menstrual cycle following dosing with Moviprep Substance abuse Have taken part in another clinical study within the previous 3 months Previous gastrointestinal surgery of any kind apart from appendicectomy Exclusion criteria for group 3 : Any history of serious acute or chronic illness especially gastrointestinal Diabetes Mellitus Pregnancy or breast feeding Unsuitable for MRI scanning ( i.e . have metal implants or a pace maker ) Regular use of medication interfering with gastrointestinal function including opiates or constipating drugs Subjects using the oral contraceptive pill will be excluded if not prepared to use an alternative barrier method of contraception for the duration of the menstrual cycle following dosing with Moviprep Substance abuse Have taken part in another clinical study within the previous 3 months Previous gastrointestinal surgery of any kind apart from appendicectomy/cholecystectomy",72,0,18 Years,65 Years

University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center,NCT01621230,Effects of Bupivacaine Induced Motor Blockade During the Second Stage of Labor,University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center,4,1,Pregnancy,Drug,Epidural Bupivacaine plus fentanyl,Treatment,Double,"The aim of this study is to measure the effects of bupivacaine administered via epidural catheters on indices of motor blockade ascertained during the second stage of labor . This is a randomized , double-blind , controlled trial designed to address the primary research question : Does bupivacaine lengthen the second stage of labor ? The secondary research question is : Is there other evidence of motor blockade attributable to bupivacaine during the second stage of labor ? The investigators know from prior studies that the length of the second stage in nulliparous women delivered at Parkland Hospital without epidural analgesia is 28 minutes . The investigators hypothesize in this now proposed study that epidural analgesia with bupivacaine will significantly increase this baseline from 28 minutes to 37 minutes or more ( a 33 % increase ) thus implicating motor blockade . Baseline data for the Bromage and Breen scores during the second stage as well as the uterine contractility data are not available as these indices of motor blockade have not here-to-fore been studied in this context . Currently at Parkland Hospital , 82 % of nulliparous women undergoing induction of labor at term receive continuous epidural infusions with bupivacaine during the first and second stages of labor . Such women will be identified when admitted for scheduled inductions at Parkland . After informed consent is obtained standard management of labor induction will be provided . Those consented women reaching 8 cm cervical dilation will be randomized . Group I will receive bupivacaine plus fentanyl via epidural catheter during the second stage ( i.e . 10 cm dilation ) and Group II will receive only fentanyl infusion via epidural catheter ( see study procedure below ) . Both the patient and the caregiver will be blinded as to whether the patient is in the bupivacaine plus fentanyl arm or the fentanyl only arm . To detect a 33 % increase ( from 28 minutes to 37 minutes ) in the primary outcome the investigators need a total of 310 women enrolled in the study ( or 155 per arm ) . Assuming a 30 % consent rate and given that approximately 1000 women meet the inclusion criteria each year at Parkland , the investigators project that this study could be completed in 12 months .","Nulliparous women scheduled for labor inductions on Monday through Friday and who have consented to this study will be randomized to one of two arms : bupivacaine plus fentanyl epidural analgesia throughout labor and delivery ( including the second stage ) or epidural bupivacaine plus fentanyl until 8 cm cervical dilation and only fentanyl thereafter . From activation of epidural analgesia to 8 cm cervical dilation the prevailing standard epidural technique in use at Parkland Hospital will be used . Briefly , 19-ga multi-orifice epidural catheter is placed using 17-ga 3 ½cm Tuohy needle into the L3-L4 lumbar interspace . Lactated Ringers solution , 500-1000mL will be infused during placement of the epidural catheter to mitigate hypotension . A test dose using 1.5 % lidocaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine , 3mL , will be given via the epidural catheter . If the test dose is negative , then an initial bolus of 0.25 % bupivacaine , 4-8mL , with fentanyl 100mcg is given via the catheter . After securing the epidural catheter the patient will be placed in the supine position and the anesthetic sensory level measured with the desired level of T6-T8 . Once a T6-T8 sensory block is secured the epidural infusion using 0.125 % bupivacaine with 2mcg/mL fentanyl at 10mL/hr will be started . At any time during epidural infusion the epidural catheter may be replaced at the discretion of the anesthesia provider for inadequate analgesia . Ephedrine or phenylephrine will be given intravenously for maternal hypotension defined as systolic blood pressure ≤ 90 mmHg or a decrease of 20 % systolic blood pressure from patient 's baseline . Randomization will occur when the woman reaches 8 cm cervical dilation . Envelopes containing cassettes will be sequentially randomized by Dr. McIntire and given to the attending obstetrical anesthesiologist containing one of two medications . Group I will receive a 100mL epidural cassette of 0.125 % bupivacaine with fentanyl 2mcg/mL to be infused at 10mL/hr . Group II will receive a 100mL cassette of fentanyl 10mcg/mL ( to be infused at 10mL/hr . Both groups will have the same rate of epidural infusion such that the patient , nurse , obstetrician , and anesthesia providers will be blinded to the randomized treatment group . The Parkland Investigational Drug Service ( IDS ) will provide the study drugs . The patient may request a 5mL bolus from the epidural infusion every 30 minutes if pain relief is inadequate . The obstetrician can also give patients in either study group 25mg of intravenous meperidine every hour for up to two doses if pain relief is unsatisfactory . The study regimen will continue until spontaneous delivery of the infant or until which time operative vaginal delivery or cesarean delivery is planned . At this point the study will be over and routine anesthesia care resumed . The standard of care for management of labor induction at Parkland requires continuous electronic fetal heart rate monitoring ( EFM ) as well as uterine contraction monitoring . The standard is to apply EFM internal transducers when the membranes are ruptured . Standard fetal monitors equipped with laptop computers will be used to electronically store the fetal heart rate and uterine contraction data during this study . This will permit qualification of uterine contractility during the second stage of labor . The Bromage and Breen scores for motor blockade will be assessed at complete cervical dilation and at 30 , 60 , and 90 minutes thereafter . The scoring system is as follows : Score Criteria Unable to move feet or knees ( complete block ) Able to move feet only Just able to move knees Detectable weakness of hip flexion while supine No weakness of hip flexion Able to perform partial knee bend Visual analog pain ( VAS ) scores for the adequacy of epidural analgesia from 1-10 will also be assessed at each time point used for the Bromage and Breen scores . Data collection will include maternal demographic characteristics as well as antepartum and intrapartum obstetrical features . Condition of the infant at birth based on Apgar scores and umbilical artery blood pH , as well as neonatal outcomes will be ascertained .",2012-02-06,"August 14, 2020","Inclusion Criteria : Nulliparous women at 37 weeks gestation or greater .

Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center,NCT03070730,Hemodynamic Response of Neuropathic And Non-Neuropathic POTS Patients To Adrenoreceptor Agonist And Antagonist,Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center,1,0,Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome,Drug,Droxidopa,Treatment,Triple,"The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that patients with non-neuropathic POTS will have different responsiveness than patients with neuropathic POTS to direct alpha-1 adrenoreceptor agonist therapy ( droxidopa ) and to non-selective beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist therapy ( atenolol ) . The specific goal of this protocol is to investigate the effect of atenolol and droxidopa on cardiovascular autonomic functions such as cardiovagal control , sympathetic nerve activity , and sympathetic vascular transduction , systemic hemodynamic response to orthostatic stress and on the quality of life in neuropathic and non-neuropathic patients with postural tachycardia syndrome ( POTS ) . Standardized tests are used to assess cardiovagal control function , sympathetic nerve activity , sympathetic vascular transduction , systemic hemodynamic response to head-up tilt test and standardized questionnaires to assess the quality of life in patients with POTS . The cardiovagal , sympathetic and hemodynamic measurements are performed after and during drug administration . To control the effect of medications placebo is used on separate testing visits . The order of drugs and placebo is randomized .","The pathophysiological basis of postural tachycardia syndrome ( POTS ) is not well elucidated . The most widely recognized primary cause of POTS is a `` restricted '' or `` selective '' peripheral neuropathy - neuropathic POTS . Several lines of evidence point to a restricted peripheral neuropathy , specifically sympathetic denervation in the lower hemibody , as a cause of POTS . These include venous denervation , impaired distal sudomotor dysfunction , lower norepinephrine spillover in the legs than the arms . However , not all POTS patients have peripheral neuropathy . Proposed pathogenic etiologies for non-neuropathic POTS include deconditioning , low-grade inflammation and oxidative stress . Neuropathic POTS is present in 33 % of patients while non-neuropathic POTS is present in 67 % of patients . The most frequent neuropathic feature in the neuropathic POTS group is decreased sweat output measured by quantitative sudomotor axon reflex test . Headache and gastrointestinal symptoms ( such as abdominal pain , bloating , nausea and constipation ) are also more prevalent in the neuropathic than in the non-neuropathic POTS group , suggesting more global differences between the two populations . In relation to the ambiguous pathophysiological basis , there is no definitive treatment for POTS . There are reports of improvements in hemodynamic measures and symptoms of orthostatic tolerance with pharmacologic agents that include intravenous saline , intravenous phenylephrine , midodrine , octreotide , erythropoietin , pyridostigmine , and betablockade . The therapy is however frequently disappointing . Furthermore , there are no reported long-term studies of medications to treat POTS and there are no reports of the effects of any intervention on fatigue or quality of life . The most widely used agents to treat POTS , the alpha-adrenoreceptor agonist midodrine , and the beta blockers , paradoxically have agonistic and antagonistic effects on the autonomic nervous system . Responses to these drugs are inconsistent and there are no delineated predictors of the response in POTS patients . The comparison of therapeutic interventions in this protocol are based on the rationale that while alpha-adrenoreceptor agonists are thought to be more effective in neuropathic POTS - a disorder characterized by a compensatory increase in sympathetic outflow in which sympatholysis may be counterproductive , beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists are thought to be more effective in non-neuropathic POTS - a disorder that could be characterized by increased central sympathetic outflow due to impaired sympathetic inhibition . This protocol uses droxidopa , which is converted to direct adrenoreceptor agonist , norepinephrine . The protocol also uses beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist , the non-selective atenolol . This is a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , cross-over experimental study with three trial arms , according to the two medications ( droxidopa and atenolol ) and the placebo . The trial is performed in the Center for Autonomic and Peripheral Nerve Disorders at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center . The study consists of 10 visits : screening visit , testing days to define drug sensitivity classification day autonomic testing visits follow-up visits Screening visit ( Visit 1 ) includes Consenting procedure Review of medical history Review of all current medications , prescription and over the counter Physical and neurological examinations Measure height , weight , temperature and vital signs 12-lead ECG Baseline autonomic tests Blood labs Serum pregnancy testing for women of childbearing potential Patients are able to take PO medications Drug Sensitivity Visit ( Visit 2 and 3 ) On the first visit , patients receive one 100 mg droxidopa while on the second visit patients receive one 300 mg test dose of droxidopa to define their response to the drug . The drug administration is preceded and followed by heart rate and blood pressure measurements and side effect monitoring . The two consecutive visits are made within a period of 3 days . The goal of sensitivity visit is to determine if a patient has any sign of denervation supersensitivity in response to droxidopa . The patient is considered to have denervation supersensitivity if systolic blood pressure is greater than 180 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure is greater than 110 mmHg after 3 minutes of standing or after 5 minutes of sitting or the patient is unable to tolerate the side effects believed to be related to the drug . Patient classification visit ( Visit 4 ) includes Quantitative Direct and Indirect testing of Sudomotor Function ( QDIRT ) Quantitative Sudomotor Axon Reflex Testing ( QSART ) Quantitative Sensory Testing ( QST ) Punch skin biopsy Questionnaires ( Chronic Fatigue Screening Form , Fatigue Severity Scale , Chalder Fatigue Questionnaire , etc. , see Questionnaires section ) Autonomic Evaluation Visits ( Visit 5 , 7 and 9 ) include Urine pregnancy test for women of child-bearing potential Setup and instrumentation Blood draw for hormones and catecholamines ( Visit 5 only ) Microneurography procedure Drug/placebo administration Deep breathing test Paced breathing test Modified Oxford test Sympathetic transduction Static exercise Tilt table test Primary outcome measure of autonomic evaluation visit is maximum postural tachycardia while secondary outcome measure of autonomic evaluation visit are blood pressure , heart rate , vascular resistance , muscle sympathetic nerve activity . Follow-up testing visits ( Visit 6 , 8 and 10 ) include Medical history Physical examination Vital signs EKG Blood pressure measurement Tilt table test Primary outcome measure of follow-up testing visits is the fatigue score on the Chalder Fatigue questionnaire while secondary outcome measures of follow-up testing visits are the scores on the physical functioning subscale of the SF-36 questionnaire , 7 item patient global impression of change , the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scales , the Checklist Individual Strength ( CIS ) , Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory ( MFI ) , the Fatigue Severity Scale , the EuroQOL , the HADS and anxiety scores .
