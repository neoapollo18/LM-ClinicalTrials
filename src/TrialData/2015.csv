Roux-en-Y gastric bypass ( RYGB ) is one of the most commonly performed bariatric procedures used in the treatment of severe obesity . The surgery results in significant and sustained weight loss and has a beneficial effect on blood glucose regulation . However , some patients experience the syndrome postprandial hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia years after the operation , with symptoms varying from mild dizziness to confusion , loss of consciousness and seizures . Larger insulin and glucagon-like peptide 1 ( GLP-1 ) responses to an oral glucose load are believed to play a role in the syndrome , which is not yet fully understood . There are no current treatment guidelines beside dietary recommendations . The purpose of this study is to compare different pharmacological treatments on daily blood glucose variations as well as postprandial hormonal and autonomous changes in subjects with symptoms of postprandial hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia after RYGB .","Roux-en-Y gastric bypass ( RYGB ) is one of the most commonly performed bariatric procedures used in the treatment of severe obesity . RYGB has in several studies been shown to result in significant and sustained weight loss . Moreover , RYGB has a beneficial effect on obese subjects with type 2 diabetes by improving blood glucose regulation , resulting in remission or partial remission of type 2 diabetes already days after surgery . The changes of the anatomy of the stomach and small intestine cause a faster and more abrupt increase in blood glucose after a meal . As a consequence of the changed glucose absorption after RYGB and the increased insulin secretion , some subjects experience the condition named postprandial hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia . Postprandial hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia is typically seen years after RYGB and the symptoms vary from mild dizziness to confusion , loss of consciousness and seizures . The condition is characterized by large postprandial blood glucose variations accompanied by exaggerated insulin and glucagon-like peptide 1 ( GLP-1 ) responses . Continuous glucose monitoring ( CGM ) have shown that subjects suffering from postprandial hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia presents large variations in blood glucose from values below 3.5 mmol/L to diabetic values above 11.1 mmol/L within the first hour after a meal . At present , there are no treatment guidelines beside dietary recommendations . Experimental treatment includes diet modifications , pharmaceutical treatments and surgical procedures . Several pharmaceutical agents have been attempted in the management of postprandial hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia , but overall the existing studies consist of few case reports and case series evaluated primarily by relief of symptoms and not by CGM and hormonal analyses .

University of Chicago,NCT02528409,Vortioxetine for Binge Eating Disorder,University of Chicago,2,1,Binge Eating Disorder,Drug,Vortioxetine,Treatment,Quadruple,"The aim of the present study is to examine the efficacy and safety of vortioxetine vs placebo in adults with moderate to severe Binge eating disorder , as indicated by at least 3 binge eating days per week for the 2 weeks before the baseline visit .","Binge-eating disorder recently included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual , 5th Edition , is now recognized as a serious public health problem . Binge-eating disorder is associated with obesity and psychiatric comorbidities , including depression , and may be predictive of metabolic syndrome . Many patients are undertreated despite functional impairments and personal and social difficulties leading to a poor quality of life . Binge-eating disorder is characterized by recurrent episodes of excessive food consumption accompanied by a sense of loss of control and psychological distress but without the inappropriate compensatory weight-loss behaviors of bulimia nervosa . Binge eating is seen in 23-46 % of obese individuals seeking weight loss treatment and its severity relates to body mass index and predicts regain of lost weight . Current treatments for binge eating disorder are often inadequate . Cognitive behavioral therapy has been shown to reduce binge eating but finding trained psychologists is difficult . Lisdexamfetamine was recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for binge eating disorder but it carries risk of addiction and diversion and so will likely not be prescribed by most family physicians or psychiatrists . Other currently available medications , used off-label for binge eating disorder , include anticonvulsants , which may reduce binge eating but are often poorly tolerated . Therefore , additional clinical trials are needed to identify effective pharmacotherapies . Consuming food is necessary for life and involves brain regions that are quite ancient in evolutionary terms . The intestinal tract itself is almost like a `` second brain '' in that it contains vast amounts of neurons used to transmit and process sensory information ; indeed the intestinal tract contains more of the neurotransmitter serotonin than the brain itself . Peripheral signals from the body ( including from the intestinal tract , but also from the blood stream - e.g . glucose levels ) are transmitted to brain regions such as the hypothalamic nuclei to help regulate appetite/hunger and maintain equilibrium . Another key aspect of circuitry involved in eating involves the brain reward system , including the nucleus accumbens , which is regulated by neurotransmitters such as dopamine , opioids , noradrenaline , and serotonin . In humans , but to a lesser degree in other animals , there is also top-down control from the prefrontal cortices , which serve to regulate our behaviors and suppress our tendencies to crave rewards , and allow us to flexibly adapt our behavior rather than get stuck in repetitive habits . Thus , binge-eating most likely involves dysregulation of all three above domains regulating behavior : the primitive 'peripheral-hypothalamic ' feedback system , reward circuitry , and top-down control circuitry . On a neurochemical level , binge eating may be related to dysfunction of the serotonergic , dopamine , glutamatergic , and norepinephrine systems . Thus , a medication to target binge eating needs to be multi-modal in terms of its pharmacology .",2015-08-13,"November 19, 2020","Inclusion Criteria : Men and women age 18-65 ; Primary diagnosis of Binge eating disorder ; At least 3 binge eating days per week for the 2 weeks before the baseline visit ; Ability to understand and sign the consent form .

HAND is HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder . It can affect memory , thinking , or concentration . It can cause mood changes . HAND may be caused by HIV hiding in the central nervous system then causing inflammation . Researchers want to see if a drug for inflammation ( Anakinra ) can help people with HIV . Objective : To see if a drug for inflammatory diseases is safe for people with HIV-infection on antiretroviral therapy . Eligibility : Adults 18-61 years old with HIV who are enrolled in another study . Design : Participants will be screened with medical history , physical exam , and blood and urine tests . Participants will have up to 15 study visits over 16 weeks . At study visit 1 , participants will have : Screening tests repeated . Brain magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scans . They will lie on a table that slides into a metal cylinder in a strong magnetic field . They will get a dye inserted by a thin plastic tube in a vein . Lumbar puncture . The lower back will be numbed . A needle will collect fluid from between bones in the back . Tests of memory , thinking , and attention . Participants may also fill out forms and do tasks . Participants will learn how to inject the study drug . Over 8 weeks , they will give themselves the study drug at home every day . They will do up to 3 injections at once . They will write down their injections and any side effects . Participants will have 5 weekly visits while taking the study drug . They will answer questions and have blood drawn . At weeks 8 and 16 , they will have a visit that repeats visit 1 .","Objective : HIV persists as a reservoir in the brain in several different cell types , including macrophages , microglia and astrocytes , and this reservoir persists even when antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) suppresses the virus in blood . This viral persistence in the CNS is thought to cause neuroinflammation through the release of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines . HIV-infected patients who have evidence of neuroinflammation in CSF are more likely to have cognitive impairment even when the virus is optimally treated with ART . This cognitive impairment , currently named HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder ( HAND ) , affects 20-37 % of the HIV-infected and ART-treated population . Without ART , the rates of severe HAND are incredibly high , but in the current era in areas where ART is widely available , the cognitive deficits are often subtle . Despite this reduction in the degree of impairment and fewer cases of overt dementia , patients with HAND have poor medication adherence , problems with decision making , vocational disability , and an overall reduced quality of life compared to HIV-infected patients without cognitive impairment . This phase 1 study of anakinra will investigate the safety of anakinra in patients with HIV on antiretroviral therapy . Anakinra , an IL-1 receptor antagonist that has broad anti-inflammatory effects , has demonstrated safety and efficacy in two other inflammatory diseases ( rheumatoid arthritis and neonatal onset multisystem inflammatory disorder ) for which it is FDA-approved . It has not yet been used in patients with HIV infection . Study Population : The study will be conducted simultaneously at two centers : the NIH Clinical Center and the Johns Hopkins University ( JHU ) Department of Neurology and will enroll twelve participants with HIV infection on antiretroviral therapy . Approximately half of the patients will be enrolled at each site . The study will not enroll patients with evidence of dementia . Design : This is a single-arm , open-label study of anakinra . Participants will self-administer daily injections of anakinra for 8 weeks . The dose will be increased over the first four weeks to minimize injection site reactions . Participants will be evaluated prior to the first dose of anakinra , weekly during the first five weeks , at the end of anakinra administration , and after an 8-week follow-up period without anakinra . Patients enrolled at the NIH will complete all visits there . Patients enrolled at JHU will complete all visits there with the exception of the three study MRI s which will be completed at the NIH . Outcome Measures : Safety will be assessed throughout the 8 weeks of treatment and during the 8-week followup period .

Evaluation of the efficacy of type 2 thyroplasty using titanium bridges will expand the therapeutic options available for adductor spasmodic dysphonia and establishment of a standard therapy .","Spasmodic dysphonia is a type of functional dysphonia not associated with any organic abnormality or palsy of the larynx . The speech disorder in this disease is caused by involuntary and intermittent spasms of the intralaryngeal muscles ( Castelon , 2002 ) . There is no curative treatment for this disease . Conservative therapies include voice training ( voice therapy ) and muscle relaxant medication to ease the tension in the larynx during speech , although there is not much evidence to support the effectiveness of either . An internationally employed therapy is local injection of botulinum toxin A into the intralaryngeal muscles to suppress involuntary movements of the vocal cords . The injection can be administered percutaneously from the anterior neck within a short time , and a number of reports have indicated a greater than 90 % efficacy of this treatment ( Tisch 2003 , Blitzer 2010 ) . However , this local injection therapy is effective only for a limited period of 3 to 4 months , and periodic injections have to be continued throughout life for maintaining relief from the symptoms under the present circumstances . Type 2 thyroplasty is an operative procedure in which the thyroid cartilage is incised at the midline , and the incised gap is opened and fixed with the thyroarytenoid muscles attached on both sides , so that the vocal cords do not shut too tightly during speech even with strong adduction of the glottis , as the symptoms of adductor spasmodic dysphonia are caused by excessive closure of the glottis due to strong involuntary and intermittent adduction of the intralaryngeal muscles ( Isshiki 2001 ) . In 2002 , the titanium bridge made of biocompatible pure titanium was developed in Japan for exclusive use in type 2 thyroplasty ( Isshiki 2004 ) . When the titanium bridge was used in actual cases , the symptoms disappeared without recurrence after the operation ( Sanuki 2007 , Sanuki 2009 , Isshiki & Sanuki 2009 , Sanuki 2010 ) .

Hypothesis : MR antagonism , as a monotherapy or in combination with a calcimimetic , is a mechanism to lower parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) in primary hyperparathyroidism ( P-HPTH ) . Study Design : Sixty subjects with P-HPTH will be enrolled to randomly receive eplerenone ( a potassium-sparing diuretic that directly blocks the MR ) , amiloride ( a potassium-sparing diuretic that does not directly block the MR ) , or placebo for 4 weeks . Thereafter , all subjects will receive cinacalcet therapy ( a calcimimetic that lowers PTH ) in addition to their randomized intervention for an additional 2 weeks . Anticipated Results : In this proof-of-concept study , eplerenone therapy will lower PTH , serum calcium , and markers of bone resorption in P-HPTH , when compared to placebo . The PTH response to amiloride will resemble that of placebo , suggesting that the eplerenone mediated reductions in PTH are specific to interactions with the MR .

These target receptors have been known to play important roles in induction and transmission of pain signals . There have been many efforts to develop selective drugs to treat pain , but usually unsuccessful due to the lack of efficacy or limitations of single-target approach for new drug discovery . VVZ-149 is expected to be a dual-target drug , demonstrated having a potential synergism between GlyT2 and 5HT2A to maximize an antinociceptive effect in the in vivo animal models .

GlyT2 blockage increases inhibitory synaptic transmission by glycine in the spinal cord , resulting in a reduction of pain transmissions to the brain . 5HT2A blockage decreases descending serotonergic facilitatory modulation on pain transmission by the brain and reduces nociceptor activation in peripheral nerves , which are primary sources of pain in post-surgical pain .

"The University of Texas Health Science Center, Houston",NCT02466074,Augmenting Cerebral Blood Flow to Treat Established Multiple Sclerosis,"The University of Texas Health Science Center, Houston",2,0,Multiple Sclerosis,Drug,Acetazolamide,Treatment,Triple,This study will evaluate how improved cerebral blood flow affects the way in which newly formed MS lesions evolve and whether tissue repair is improved . Patients with multiple sclerosis ( MS ) will be treated with acetazolamide in daily divided doses and obtain MRI to determine how much and in which regions of the brain cerebral perfusion improves as well as the extent to which tissue integrity is improved in these areas .,"Cerebral perfusion is altered in many disease states , including MS. Altered perfusion has been seen in patients with all multiple sclerosis ( MS ) phenotypes and is well established as occurring early in relapsing-remitting disease . Previous research in our laboratory has shown that reduced cerebral perfusion in MS patients is a precursor to the formation of chronic lesions . In addition , studies have suggested that `` virtual hypoxia '' , resultant from the combination of diminished cerebral perfusion and increased energy demand , contributes to tissue damage that strongly correlates with clinical disability in persons with MS. Our preliminary studies have already shown short-term increases in global and regional cerebral perfusion in MS patients after therapy with acetazolamide ( ACZ ) . The central hypothesis is that if cerebral perfusion is important in tissue injury , then MS lesions within hypoperfused areas are more likely to develop permanent tissue damage , and medications that improve cerebral perfusion might beneficially alter the evolution of MS plaques , enhance remyelination and repair and diminish clinical disability progression . Sixty MS patients will be enrolled in this single-center exploratory RCT . Half of the patients will be randomly assigned to get ACZ treatment in phase 1 consisting of 24 weeks on ACZ , followed by another 24 weeks on ACZ during phase 2 . The other half of the patients will be assigned to placebo for 24 weeks in phase 1 and then switched to ACZ and followed for 24 weeks in phase 2 . This study will utilize various imaging techniques to determine the degree to which cerebral blood flow is improved in MS subjects after administration of ACZ .",2015-06-03,"March 31, 2023","Inclusion Criteria : Diagnosis of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis using revised McDonald criteria Stable on any FDA-approved disease-modifying therapy .

Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre,NCT02464761,Photodynamic Therapy for the Treatment of Vertebral Metastases,Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre,1,1,Vertebral Metastases,Drug,Visudyne,Treatment,,"An estimated 10 percent of primary breast , prostate , lung , thyroid and renal cell tumors metastasize to the spine . The majority of these tumors are detected before surgical intervention is required and most patients receive radiation therapy for symptomatic relief . Complete pain control , duration of pain control , high recurrence rates and soft tissue complications make radiation a less than ideal treatment . Also , pre-operative radiation therapy is a significant negative predictor for surgical outcomes . To improve the treatment options for patients with advanced cancer with spinal lesions the research team investigated a new minimally invasive therapy known as photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) that targets metastatic spine lesions with limited side effects . PDT involves the use of a photo-activated chemotherapeutic agent , given intravenously that when stimulated by non-thermal wavelength-specific light allows for selective ablation of tumor tissue . The light is delivered to the spine through small fiber optic cables using a diode laser . By combining canine and porcine studies the investigators have strong evidence to support that PDT is both safe and effective for the treatment of metastatic tumors in the spine . PDT is targeted , repeatable , minimally invasive and has limited local and systemic side effects . Its use would enhance the treatment options for patients with advanced stage cancer . The goal of the present study is to demonstrate that PDT can be safely and effectively given to treat spinal metastases in patients with advanced stage cancer who have multiple lesions or who have failed radiation or surgical intervention . The effectiveness of this treatment will be determined through clinical and radiographic endpoints along with recurrence and survival . The investigators intend to demonstrate that PDT is a minimally invasive method with low morbidity and mortality by which spinal tumors can be ablated and later stabilized through vertebroplasty , optimizing quality of life and providing effective treatment .","There are over 1.5 million cases of cancer reported each year in North America and a significant number of patients eventually suffer from metastases to the spine which present as an extremely challenging problem for both the clinician and patient . Primary tumors that most commonly affect the spine include breast , prostate , lung , thyroid and renal cell cancer . Estimates from large clinical series report at least a 10 percent rate of metastases to the spine from these most common tumors . These lesions are extremely painful and significantly affect the quality of life of advanced stage cancer patients . The majority of these tumors are detected before surgical intervention is required and most patients receive radiation therapy for their spine lesions for symptomatic relief . However , complete pain control , duration of pain control along with a high recurrence rate of lesions and soft tissue complications makes radiation a less than an ideal treatment . In addition , pre-operative radiation therapy is a significant negative prognosticator for surgical outcomes . To improve the treatment options for patients with advanced cancer with spinal lesions the research team has investigated a new minimally invasive therapy , known as photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) that targets metastatic spine lesions directly and has limited side effects . PDT involves the use of a photo-activated chemotherapeutic agent , benzoporphyrin derivative ( verteporfin/Visudyne ) given intravenously that when stimulated by non-thermal wavelength-specific light allows for selective ablation of tumor tissue . The light is delivered to the spine through small fiber optic cables ( outer diameter 0.98mm , inner core of 0.5mm mm ) using a diode laser . Visudyne is an FDA and Health Canada approved photosensitizer that has been used in over one million patients for the treatment of age related macular degeneration , a leading cause of blindness in the elderly . To investigate the use of PDT for spinal metastases the investigators initially developed a bioluminescent metastatic rodent model using human breast cancer that metastasized to the spine . Using this model it was determined that PDT was effective at treating metastatic breast cancer lesions in the spine . The research team next utilized non-tumor bearing canine and porcine models to determine that the treatment could be safely delivered to the spine and conduct light dosimetry analysis . The safety of PDT intra-operatively was assessed using somatosensory evoked potentials and through post-treatment clinical examination and magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . The effects PDT had on the spine were analyzed by comparing pre-operative and post-operative MR imaging and correlating those in turn with histological analysis . None of these animals suffered weakness or complication from the use of PDT around the spinal cord . During these studies the investigators developed the planning , delivery and instrumentation methodologies to deliver PDT to spinal tumors and the methodology to combine this therapy with vertebroplasty , a percutaneous method of stabilizing the spine . In addition , in a separate set of studies , highgrade osteosarcomas in canines were treated to determine the effect PDT had on large bone tumors . The results of this study again provided comparison of pre and post-treatment effects seen on MRI and histological analysis . The volume of effect seen in the osteosarcomas was up to 25cm ( cubed ) and was comparable to the volume of effect required for complete treatment of spinal lesions . By combining the canine and porcine studies there is strong evidence that PDT is both safe and effective for the treatment of metastatic tumors in the spine . PDT has many advantages over current therapies ; it is targeted , repeatable , minimally invasive and has limited local and systemic side effects . Its use would enhance the treatment options for patients with advanced stage cancer . The goal of the present study is to demonstrate that PDT can be safely and effectively given to treat spinal metastases in patients with advanced stage cancer . The study is a pilot study and will determine the safe and accurate treatment of 30 patients with spinal metastases who have multiple lesions or who have failed radiation or surgical intervention . The effectiveness of this treatment will be determined through clinical and radiographic endpoints with recurrence and survival also determined . The investigators intend to demonstrate that PDT provides a minimally invasive method with low morbidity and mortality by which spinal tumors can be ablated and later stabilized through vertebroplasty , optimizing quality of life and providing effective treatment for this devastating manifestation of advanced stage cancer .",2015-06-01,"February 14, 2018","Inclusion Criteria : Age between 20 and 85 Established metastatic vertebral bony disease in the spine Eligible for single level vertebral osteoplasty ( i.e . percutaneous vertebroplasty , kyphoplasty ) Patients who are symptomatic with axial pain from vertebral metastatic involvement and are at risk for pathologic fracture ; or have had a symptomatic pathologic fracture Patients who have shown radiographic progression and/or pain symptoms of a documented vertebral metastasis despite non-surgical therapies Exclusion Criteria : Progressive neurological compromise Osteoblastic vertebral metastatic disease Posterior vertebral cortical/body wall involvement Spinal canal compromise / neurologic compression Anticipated life expectancy of less than twelve weeks to live Cognitive impairment and/or language barriers to study participation Severe hepatic impairment ( Child 's C ) with active hepatitis or hepatic disease .

CHU de Quebec-Universite Laval,NCT02468830,Pilot Study of Mirabegron in Pediatric Patients With Overactive Bladder,CHU de Quebec-Universite Laval,3,1,Overactive Bladder,Drug,mirabegron,Treatment,,The objective is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of mirabegron to treat urinary incontinence in children with Overactive Bladder that are refractory and/or intolerant to antimuscarinics .,"Overactive bladder ( OAB ) is a highly prevalent disorder in the pediatric population . This condition comprises many urinary symptoms , such as urgency , increased daytime frequency of micturition , urge incontinence and nocturia . These symptoms are especially troublesome for the pediatric patients and their family since it causes embarrassment and it limits everyday activities and impairs children 's development . Furthermore , serious complications are seen if this condition is not treated properly , as urinary tract infection , vesico-ureteral reflux and dysfunctional voiding . Antimuscarinic agents are the current pharmacologic mainstay for OAB . Many side effects are reported with the clinical use of antimuscarinics . Oxybutynin is the most widely antimuscarinic agent used in the pediatric population and is the only molecule approved by Health Canada for children with OAB . However , some patients have a suboptimal response to antimuscarinic and many experience side effects . Children with OAB therefore represent a disease population with a need for an alternative effective , safe and well-tolerated therapy to help manage the overactive detrusor , reducing or preventing incontinence . Mirabegron , a β3-adrenoceptor ( β3-AR ) agonist approved for the treatment of OAB symptoms in the adult population , is the first of a new class of compounds with a different mechanism of action . The recommended starting dose of mirabegron is 25mg , which can be increased to 50mg , based on individual efficacy and tolerability . Side effects commonly reported with antimuscarinics were not observed more often with mirabegron than with placebo ( headache 2.0 % , dry mouth 2.0 % , constipation 1.6 % ) . Several Phase II and III studies have shown significant improvement in clinical OAB symptoms in adults treated with mirabegron with a favorable tolerability profile . Mirabegron has not been studied yet for pediatric patients and no recommendation with regards to its use has been issued by the manufacturer nor medical regulatory bodies . A prospective open-label study , using an adjusted-dose regimen of mirabegron ( 25-50mg ) , including pediatric patients with refractory urinary incontinence due to OAB . This protocol was approved by the investigators ' research ethics board . Patients without symptom improvement or with partial response under intensive behavioural protocol and medical therapy ( at least 2 different antimuscarinic agents ) will be recruited . Patients with significantly bothersome S/E on antimuscarinics are also included . primary end-point is efficacy toward urinary continence and secondary end-points are tolerability and safety . The patients/parents satisfaction will also be recorded . After 8 to 12 weeks on the new medication , the possibility of up-titration will be assessed . Patients and parents will be questioned on compliance , tolerability and efficacy . If the patient is taking the medication ≥80 % of the time , does not have any significant side effects and still has significant OAB symptoms , the investigators will offer a dose increase ( Mirabegron 50mg daily ) . If accepted , the medication will be provided with instructions to report any new side effects . Subjects will complete a 3-day voiding diary prior to each medical visit to assess the efficacy of the treatment and urotherapy . Visits will be done every 3 months .",2015-05-30,"June 16, 2018","Inclusion Criteria : Male or female ≥ 5 years old and ≤17 years old OAB diagnostic according to the International Children Continence Society ( ICCS ) and less than 65 % of the expected mean bladder capacity for age is confirmed ( 30 + ( age in years x 30 ) mL ) on a 3-day voiding diary .

CHU de Quebec-Universite Laval,NCT02476175,Add-on Mirabegron in Pediatric Patients With Refractory Overactive Bladder,CHU de Quebec-Universite Laval,3,1,Overactive Bladder,Drug,Mirabegron,Treatment,,The objective is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of adding mirabegron to an antimuscarinic to treat urinary incontinence in children with Overactive Bladder that are refractory to antimuscarinics .,"Overactive bladder ( OAB ) is a highly prevalent disorder in the pediatric population . This condition comprises many urinary symptoms , such as urgency , increased daytime frequency of micturition , urge incontinence and nocturia . These symptoms are especially troublesome for the pediatric patients and their family since it causes embarrassment and it limits everyday activities and impairs children 's development . Furthermore , serious complications are seen if this condition is not treated properly , as urinary tract infection , vesico-ureteral reflux and dysfunctional voiding . Antimuscarinic agents are the current pharmacologic mainstay for OAB . Many side effects are reported with the clinical use of antimuscarinics . Oxybutynin is the most widely antimuscarinic agent used in the pediatric population and is the only molecule approved by Health Canada for children with OAB . However , some patients have a suboptimal response to antimuscarinic and many experience side effects . Children with OAB therefore represent a disease population with a need for an alternative effective , safe and well-tolerated therapy to help manage the overactive detrusor , reducing or preventing incontinence . Mirabegron , a β3-adrenoceptor ( β3-AR ) agonist approved for the treatment of OAB symptoms in the adult population , is the first of a new class of compounds with a different mechanism of action . The recommended starting dose of mirabegron is 25mg , which can be increased to 50mg , based on individual efficacy and tolerability . Side effects commonly reported with antimuscarinics were not observed more often with mirabegron than with placebo ( headache 2.0 % , dry mouth 2.0 % , constipation 1.6 % ) . Several Phase II and III studies have shown significant improvement in clinical OAB symptoms in adults treated with mirabegron with a favorable tolerability profile . Mirabegron has not been studied yet for pediatric patients and no recommendation with regards to its use has been issued by the manufacturer nor medical regulatory bodies . A prospective open-label study , using an adjusted-dose regimen of mirabegron ( 25-50mg ) added to the existing antimuscanic treatment ( dual treatment ) , including pediatric patients with refractory urinary incontinence due to OAB . This protocol was approved by the investigators ' research ethics board . Patients without symptom improvement or with partial response under intensive behavioural protocol and medical therapy ( at least 2 different antimuscarinic agents ) will be recruited . Pprimary end-point is efficacy toward urinary continence and secondary end-points are tolerability and safety . The patients/parents satisfaction will also be recorded .

It can also include other minimally invasive tumor treatments such as transarterial chemoembolization ( TACE ) . TACE treatment for liver cancer helps control the cancer but is not considered a cure . Researchers want to learn more about the effects of TACE on liver tumors and surrounding tissue . To do this , they will use a positive emission test ( PET ) and a radioactive tracer called [ 18F ] FMISO . Objectives : - To see if [ 18F ] FMISO is useful for evaluating what happens to liver tumors and surrounding tissue after TACE . Eligibility : - People age 18 and older with liver cancer who have been approved to have TACE . Design : Participants will meet with a study researcher to see if they can take part in the study . Participants will have TACE under a separate NCI protocol or at a hospital other than the NIH Clinical Center . Before and after TACE , participants will have a CT and MRI of the abdomen . For these scans , they will lie in a machine that takes pictures of their body . They will also have blood tests and a physical exam . The [ 18F ] FMISO imaging study will be performed at NIH only . Participants will have an intravenous catheter placed in their arm ( if they do not have one ) . The [ 18F ] FMISO tracer will be injected . Participants will have PET-CT scans . Each scan will take about 30 minutes . Some participants will also have [ 18F ] FMISO and PET-CT scans before TACE . As part of standard care for TACE , participants will have CT and MRI scans at regular intervals . This will evaluate tumor response .","Background TACE is the standard therapy for inoperable primary liver cancers or tumor control prior to transplantation . The mechanisms for TACE s failure remains poorly understood . Although acute hypoxia and significant tumor necrosis occurs following TACE , the tumor adaptive response and localization for such have not been well characterized . Imaging tools using a hypoxia-specific tracer [ ( 18 ) F ] FMISO may help identify the pattern and distribution of acute post-TACE tumor hypoxia relative to demonstrated tumor progression . The primary hypothesis of this study states that tumor progression post-TACE arises from changes in tumor phenotype induced by treatment-related hypoxia superimposed on the dynamic process of underlying tumor hypoxia . Objectives -To determine the feasibility of hypoxic tumor identification despite relatively high liver background signal , and describe patterns of tumor hypoxia in the immediate post-TACE treatment period using PET imaging [ ( 18 ) F ] MISO uptake registered with cross-sectional imaging . Eligibility Patients greater than or equal to 18 years with inoperable primary hepatic malignancy or hepatic-dominant metastatic-disease and be otherwise eligible to receive TACE treatment . Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma should have intermediate stage disease according to the BCLC staging system ( Stage A4 or B ) . Patients must not have had chemotherapy- or radiation therapy to liver for at least 2 weeks prior to starting study treatments . Patients must not have an acute , critical illness . Patients must not be pregnant Able to understand and be willing to sign a written informed consent Design Fifteen patients with primary or metastatic liver malignancy will be enrolled into this pilot , non-randomized , open study of the feasibility of using ( 18 ) F-fluoromisonidazole PET scanning to determine hypoxic tumor identification and localization , and to identify the pattern and distribution of acute post-TACE tumor hypoxia relative to demonstrated tumor progression . Twenty-four to seventy-two hours after standard of care TACE , patients will undergo PET scanning using 0.1mCi/kg ( maximum 10mCi ) of ( 18 ) F-fluoromisonidazole [ ( 18 ) F ] MISO ) .",2015-06-12,"March 29, 2019","INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients must have confirmed inoperable primary hepatic malignancy or hepatic dominant metastatic - neoplastic disease evidenced by histology or cytology , or characteristic enhancement pattern on CT or MRI together with an abnormal serum alpha-fetoprotein > 200mg/dl in the case of hepatocellular carcinoma . Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma should conform to intermediate stage disease according to the BCLC ( 16 ) staging system ( Stage A4 or B ) and be otherwise eligible to receive TACE treatment . Patients must have had no chemotherapy or radiotherapy to the liver therapy for , their malignancy for at least 2 weeks ( or until response can be adequately assessed ) prior to treatment and must have recovered from all clinically significant side effects of therapeutic and diagnostic interventions .

People usually take medicines for the pain , but they may not work well and might cause side effects . A new strategy called Acceptance and Commitment Training ( ACT ) may help these people cope with chronic pain . ACT focuses on things like values and living in the moment . Objective : - To see if Acceptance and Commitment Training improves pain coping in people with NF1 pain . Eligibility : - People age 16-34 who have NF1 , 1 or more PN tumors , and pain that interferes with their daily functioning . Design : Participants will be screened with a physical exam , medical history , and questions about their pain . Participants will fill out questionnaires about their pain and feelings . Their heart rate will be measured via electrocardiogram ( ECG ) . Participants will be divided into 2 groups randomly . One will wait 8 weeks . The other will start training right away . Participants will have 2 two-hour sessions with an ACT trainer . They will learn techniques for setting goals based on personal values and other ways to cope with pain . They will get a workbook and a compact disc ( CD ) to take home for practice . Participants will do practice exercises at home between sessions . They will get weekly emails with a practice exercise . They will join video chat sessions via home computer with their trainer . All participants will return to National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) after 8 weeks for questionnaires and an ECG . The wait group will then start training . They will return 8 weeks later for questionnaires and an ECG . Six months later , they will complete questionnaires from home by computer .","BACKGROUND : Neurofibromatosis type 1 ( NF1 ) is a genetic disorder that affects approximately 1 in 3,500 individuals . A number of common clinical manifestations , including plexiform neurofibromas , can cause frequent and significant pain and impact quality of life . Often , NF1-related pain is not well-controlled with medication and many of the medications cause significant side effects . To our knowledge , only one prior study ( by our group ) has examined the effectiveness of a psychological intervention for chronic pain in adolescents and young adults ( AYA ) with NF1 . Acceptance and Commitment Therapy ( ACT ) , a newer generation of cognitive-behavioral therapy , focuses on encouraging individuals to engage in more adaptive ways of coping with pain . The goal of ACT is not to eliminate the person 's pain , but to optimize the person 's functioning despite their pain OBJECTIVES : -To compare pain interference mean score changes from baseline to 8 weeks between the ACT intervention group and the waitlist ( WL ) group . ELIGIBILITY : Patients 16 - 59 years of age with a confirmed diagnosis of NF1 and greater than or equal to 1 plexiform neurofibroma ( PN ) . The patient must obtain a mean score of 2.0 or higher or a score of 3 on three or more items on the Pain Interference Index , and report having pain that interferes with functioning for at least three months . The patient must have regular access to a computer or tablet with internet access . DESIGN : This is a psychological intervention study to determine the potential benefit of ACT on pain interference , with patients randomized to the ACT intervention or a wait-list control group . Patients will come to the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) for a 2-day visit ( Time 1 ) . After baseline assessments ( questionnaires and ECG ) are completed , participants in the ACT group will take part in two 2-hour ACT training sessions . At home , this group will receive weekly emails through week 8 , and will participate in further ACT training/educational sessions via video chat at weeks 2 , 4 , and 6 . All patients will return to the NIH at week 8 ( Time 2 ) to complete follow-up questionnaires and ECG . At this time , the WL group will cross over and receive the ACT intervention ( in-person sessions , weekly emails , and video chat sessions ) . All patients will complete questionnaires again from home six months following the completion of the intervention . To detect a change of .68 standard deviation on the primary outcome measure between the two groups at .80 power , 41 patients per group are needed .",2015-06-12,"May 24, 2022","INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR PARTICIPANT Patients must be between 16 and 59 years of age at the time of the baseline assessment .

The questionnaires are given at intake and at experiment end ( 3 months ) . Participants will receive ALC for 3 months . These findings will indirectly determine the effect of ALC on the function and inflammatory state of the pancreas . Currently , there is no specific therapy for chronic pancreatitis , and its pathophysiology is still poorly understood . It is known that chronic pancreatitis is caused by ongoing inflammation in the pancreas , yet , no pharmacological intervention exists that optimally addresses this .

Chinese University of Hong Kong,NCT02534571,To Compare a Hemostatic Powder TC-325 and Standard Treatment in the Control of Acute Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding From Nonvariceal Causes,Chinese University of Hong Kong,3,1,Acute Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding,Device,Endoscopic Application of a Hemostatic Powder TC-325,Treatment,,"Acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding is a common medical emergency . Bleeding peptic ulcers and other non-variceal causes constitute to about 95 % of all cases of bleeding . Endoscopic treatment stops active bleeding , reduces rate of further bleeding and leads to improved patients outcomes . Endoscopic treatment can be technically demanding especially with lesions in difficult anatomic positions and to endoscopists with less experience . TC-325 is a propriety mineral blend hemostatic powder used to compress external civilian and military traumatic injuries . Investigators reported the first endoscopic application of TC-325 in 20 patients with actively bleeding gastro-duodenal ulcers . Investigators were able to stop bleeding in 19 of them . Subsequent case series from others reported a similar rate in the acute control of bleeding . To further define the role of TC-325 as a mono-therapy , a comparison to the current standard in endoscopic treatment is required . A non-inferiority randomized trial is being proposed to compare endoscopic use of TC-325 as a mono-therapy to current standards ( i.e . hemoclips or thermo-coagulation with or without pre-injection with diluted epinephrine ) in hemostatic treatment in patients with acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding from non-variceal causes . The non-inferiority primary endpoint is control of bleeding over 30 days from randomization . Other outcome endpoints include further endoscopic , angiographic or surgical treatments , hospitalization , blood transfusion and mortality . Investigators also compare ease of therapy measured by procedure time and a 10 cm visual analogue scale rated by endoscopists . Endoscopic application of TC-325 is a simple and less skill dependent technique . It may prove useful in bleeding from anatomically challenging sites of the gastro-duodenal tract .","Impact and Objectives Long-term impact : Acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding is a common medical emergency . The majority of causes are non-variceal in etiology and are mostly peptic ulcers . Endoscopic treatment reduces further bleeding , surgery and deaths from the condition . The current endoscopic treatment to non-variceal causes includes.the use of hemo-clips and thermo-coagulation . Endoscopic treatment is skill demanding and can be challenging in difficult access areas in the gastroduodenal tract e.g . posterior bulbar duodenum . Endoscopic application of hemostatic powder ( labeled TC-325 ) is technically easy . The proposed randomized trial is the first to compare TC-325 to standard treatment . An non-inferior treatment of hemostatic powder TC-325 would mean wider application of endoscopic treatment as most endoscopists are able to use it . It can at least be used for acute control of bleeding allowing time for more definitive treatment . Objectives : To compare clinical efficacy of the hemostatic powder TC-325 to standard treatment in overall rate of hemostasis in patients with active bleeding from a non-variceal source in the upper gastrointestinal tract . Investigators aim to determine the initial rate of hemostasis and the rate of further bleeding after initial control in both groups . Investigators would like to define role of TC-325 as a mono-therapy when compared to standard treatment . The rate of further bleeding after initial control would also inform us if endoscopic application of TC-325 should be followed by a second look endoscopy with targeted treatment to the bleeding artery . To compare ease of application of hemostatic powder TC-325 to standard treatment . Background of Research , Research Plan and Methodology : a . Background of research Acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding ( AUGIB ) is one of the commonest medical emergencies . Mortality in patients with AUGIB remains high . In the National United Kingdom Audit of 2007 , the crude overall in patient mortality was 10 % . Mortality increases in patients with advanced age and significant comorbid illnesses . Endoscopic therapy greatly improves outcomes in patients with AUGIB . In pooled analyses of randomized controlled trials on endoscopic therapy in patients with nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding , endoscopic therapy significantly reduces not only further bleeding but also surgery and deaths . The National United Kingdom audit in 2007 found continuing delays in endoscopy and treatment in patients admitted with AUGIB . Only 55 % of patients judged to belong to the high risk group underwent endoscopy within 24 hours of their admissions , and only 74 % of high risk lesions were offered endoscopic treatment . The gap in service provision may be an organization issue . The lack of skills in endoscopic therapy may also contribute to this shortfall . An easy-to-use endoscopic treatment is likely to help generalize endoscopic hemostasis . The current standard of endoscopic therapy consists of the use of hemoclips or thermo-coagulation with or without pre-injection with diluted epinephrine . TC-325 is a proprietary , inert inorganic mineral blend powder approved by FDA for the purpose of hemostasis . In the United States the powder is used for compression treatment of bleeding from external injuries in both civilian and combat casualties . The powder is highly absorbent . When in contact with fluid or blood the powder rapidly concentrates clotting factors at the bleeding site and forms an adherent coagulum . In 2011 , Investigators reported the first endoscopic human application of the hemostatic powder TC-325 . In 20 patients with Forrest type I bleeding from their gastro-duodenal ulcers , Investigators were able to control bleeding in 19 of them . The single patient with refractory bleeding from an angular gastric ulcer underwent angiography to his left gastric artery and a pseudo-aneurysm was found arising from the article . The aneurysm was successfully embolized with coils by angiographic methods . None of these patients needed surgery or died when followed up for 30 days . These initial results were encouraging . In gastroduodenal ulcers with Forrest I bleeding , rate of further bleeding would be around 55 % if untreated by endoscopy . Subsequent to this pilot study , several series were published on the endoscopic use of TC-325 . The pooled rate in the initial control of bleeding with the use of TC-325 was 89.6 % . Rate of further bleeding after hemostasis was 19.2 % . The reported series consisted of patients with different case-mix but exclusively non-variceal in etiologies . Indications for use of TC-325 also varied in these series . The powder was used as mono-therapy , in combination to other endoscopic therapies or as a rescue therapy when conventional endoscopic treatment failed . In the absence of comparative studies , the role of TC-325 remains undefined . Herein Investigators propose a randomized controlled study to compare endoscopic use of TC-325 as a mono-therapy to current standards of hemostasis using either hemo-clips or contact thermo-coagulation with or without diluted epinephrine in patients with active bleeding ( Forrest type I ) from non-variceal upper GI causes . Investigators hypothesize that endoscopic application of TC-325 would not be inferior in the control of bleeding from non-variceal sources when compared to standard treatment . If such is the case , endoscopic use of TC-325 may be preferred over existing techniques because of simplicity in TC-325 application . It appeals especially to endoscopists with less experience in endoscopic hemostasis . In lesions of challenging anatomical positions e.g . posterior bulbar duodenum , TC-325 may prove superior .",2015-08-06,"October 10, 2019","Inclusion Criteria : patients with overt signs of upper gastrointestinal bleeding ( hematemesis , melena and/or circulatory instability ) documented bleeding ( Forrest I ) from a non-variceal upper gastrointestinal source ( gastro-duodenal ulcers , Mallory Weiss tear , cancers , Dieulafoy 's and other vascular lesions ) at endoscopy .

Under normal conditions , members of the TGFβ family maintain homeostasis in many organ systems . In normal and non-cancerous cells , TGFβ limits the growth of epithelial , endothelial , neuronal , and hematopoietic cell lineages through anti-proliferative and apoptotic responses . In addition , TGFβ exerts potent effects that influence immune function , cell proliferation/ functional differentiation , cell adhesion , extracellular matrix production , cell motility , angiogenesis , and cytokine production . TGFβ has been implicated as an important factor in the growth , progression , and metastatic potential of advanced cancers . Although TGFβ has been shown to suppress the growth of epithelial cells in the early stages of tumor development ( premalignant conditions ) , the effect on advanced cancers is more complex [ 1 , 5-6 ] . Increased production of TGFβ has been found in many neoplasms such as breast , prostate , gastric , renal , and epidermal carcinomas , and elevated plasma TGFβ levels in patients have been correlated with advanced disease , metastases , and lower survival rates [ 7-13 ] .

The study will enroll patients with high risk ALL relapse including early bone marrow relapse and second or greater relapse of any kind . Patients with relapsed LL will also be eligible . Bone marrow evaluation will be performed after blood counts recover to assess the rate of CR ( < 5 % bone marrow blasts ) and MRD status in children following this regimen . Further treatment with or without HSCT will be at the discretion of the primary physician .,"1.0 GOALS AND OBJECTIVES ( SCIENTIFIC AIMS ) 1.1 Primary Aims 1.1.1 To evaluate the feasibility and toxicity of using bortezomib in combination with the ALL R3 re-induction regimen in pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory ALL or LL . 1.1.2 To determine the rate of complete response and negative minimal residual disease status following bortezomib combined with R3 reinduction . 2.0 BACKGROUND Despite the progress that has been made in the treatment of ALL in children , relapse of disease remains a significant treatment problem . By itself , the number of patients with relapsed ALL would be the 4th most common childhood malignancy and overall survival in these patients is poor . Using conventional treatments , second remission rates after bone marrow relapse in ALL are 81-93 % and long-term event free survival ( EFS ) is only 27-50 % . Initial standard therapy for children following relapse includes a four drug reinduction strategy , typically using prednisone , vincristine , PEG-asparaginase , and doxorubicin . For children with first marrow relapse of ALL less than 36 months from diagnosis , this four drug reinduction strategy results in a CR rate of 68 % . However , 75 % of patients in CR2 had minimal residual disease ( MRD ) that was positive ( > 0.01 % ) at the end of reinduction . The presence of MRD in relapsed ALL is strongly associated with worse long term outcomes . For children with ALL that relapsed following a second ( CR2 ) remission , outcomes are dismal with 5 year disease free survival of 15 % . In 2010 , results were published of the ALL R3 trial from the Children 's Cancer and Leukemia Group in the United Kingdom and Ireland . This trial randomized children with first relapse of ALL to receive a four drug reinduction using either mitoxantrone or idarubicin as the anthracycline . The study was closed early due to a statistically significant improvement in survival for children randomized to mitoxantrone . Children who received mitoxantrone had a 3 year disease free survival of 64.6 % compared to 35.9 % in the idarubicin group . Toxicities in this study were not excessive , and children randomized to receive mitoxantrone had significantly less toxicity than those in the idarubicin group . Based on the results of this trial , the Children 's Oncology Group ( COG ) has begun using this reinduction regimen as the backbone for new clinical trials for children with relapsed ALL . Despite the improvement in outcomes for the children with relapsed ALL treated with mitoxantrone on the R3 study , there is still a need for continued efforts to improve outcomes in patients with ALL and LL that experience a relapse . This is particularly true for high risk groups such as those who have an early bone marrow relapse ( < 36 months from diagnosis ) , second or greater relapse or relapsed LL where long term survival remains less than 50 % Bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor that has demonstrated activity in a number of cancer types including acute leukemias . Bortezomib acts by inhibiting the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway resulting in the blockade of NF-κB activation and the stabilization of multiple proapoptotic proteins including p53 , p21 , p27 , and Bax . Collectively , these effects induce apoptosis and enhance the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy . In the Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program ( PPTP ) , bortezomib showed activity against a number of ALL cell lines . As a single agent , bortezomib was effective at inhibiting NF-κB but there was no clinical response in 9 heavily pretreated children with ALL . Proteasome inhibition is able to induce apoptosis , and may be best utilized in combination with other conventional chemotherapy drugs to help overcome resistance . Preclinical evaluation of bortezomib with a number of drugs commonly used in pediatric ALL therapy demonstrated synergy with dexamethasone and additive effects when given along with vincristine , asparaginase , and doxorubicin . In a phase 1 study of children with relapsed ALL of bortezomib combined with a four drug reinduction using dexamethasone , vincristine , doxorubicin , PEG-asparaginase and intrathecal therapy , bortezomib at a dose of 1.3 mg/m2 given on days 1 , 4 , 8 and 11 was well tolerated . The phase 2 study of this regimen was able to produce a complete response or complete response without platelet recovery in 73 % of patients . These results are encouraging as these were heavily pretreated patients treated with 2 or 3 previous regimens . Due to 3 deaths from infectious toxicities , the study was amended to require infectious prophylaxis with vancomycin , levofloxacin , and voriconazole . No further deaths were seen in children following this change . Other toxicities seen on this study include grade 3 peripheral neuropathy in 2 patients . This is a phase II study designed to investigate the combination of bortezomib with the mitoxantrone reinduction regimen used in the ALL R3 trial . The study will enroll patients with high risk ALL relapse including early bone marrow relapse and second or greater relapse of any kind . Patients with relapsed LL will also be eligible . Bone marrow evaluation will be performed after blood counts recover to assess the rate of CR ( < 5 % bone marrow blasts ) and MRD status in children following this regimen . Further treatment with or without HSCT will be at the discretion of the primary physician . 2.1 Bortezomib for Injection 2.1.1 Scientific Background Bortezomib for Injection is a small-molecule proteasome inhibitor developed by Millennium Pharmaceuticals , Inc. , ( Millennium ) as a novel agent to treat human malignancies . Bortezomib is currently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration ( US FDA ) for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma ( MM ) . It is also indicated for the treatment of patients with mantle cell lymphoma ( MCL ) who have received at least 1 prior therapy . In the European Union ( EU ) , bortezomib in combination with melphalan and prednisone is indicated for the treatment of patients with previously untreated MM who are not eligible for high-dose chemotherapy with bone marrow transplant . Bortezomib is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of progressive MM in patients who have received at least 1 prior therapy and who have already undergone or are unsuitable for bone marrow transplantation . By inhibiting a single molecular target , the proteasome , bortezomib affects multiple signaling pathways . The antineoplastic effect of bortezomib likely involves several distinct mechanisms , including inhibition of cell growth and survival pathways , induction of apoptosis , and inhibition of expression of genes that control cellular adhesion , migration , and angiogenesis . Thus , the mechanisms by which bortezomib elicits its antitumor activity may vary among tumor types , and the extent to which each affected pathway is critical to the inhibition of tumor growth could also differ . Bortezomib has a novel pattern of cytotoxicity in National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) in vitro and in vivo assays . ( 19 ) In addition , bortezomib has cytotoxic activity in a variety of xenograft tumor models , both as a single agent and in combination with chemotherapy and radiation . Notably , bortezomib induces apoptosis in cells that over express bcl-2 , a genetic trait that confers unregulated growth and resistance to conventional chemotherapeutics . The mechanisms of action leading up to apoptosis have been more clearly defined and include initiation of the unfolded protein response and direct/indirect effects on various molecular targets including cell cycle control proteins p27 and p21 , cyclins , signal transduction molecules , transcription factors c-jun and HIF1- , tumor suppressor protein p53 , angiogenesis factors , and many others . Bortezomib is thought to be efficacious in multiple myeloma via its inhibition of nuclear factor B ( NF-B ) activation , its attenuation of interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) -mediated cell growth , a direct apoptotic effect , and possibly anti-angiogenic and other effects .",2015-08-04,"July 23, 2019","Inclusion Eligibility Criteria Age : > 1 and < 40 years of age at the time of enrollment Diagnosis : Precursor B-cell ALL with bone marrow ( BM ) or combined BM/extramedullary relapse ; T-cell ALL with relapsed disease ; LL with relapsed disease , or ALL ( T or pre-B ) with primary refractory disease after at least two regimens Performance Score : 50 % for patients Prior Therapy Patients who relapse while receiving standard ALL maintenance chemotherapy will not be required to have a waiting period before entry onto this study .

The survival benefit of tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) including first-line sunitinib and pazopanib in mRCC has been demonstrated , but the majority of patients enrolled in the pivotal phase III studies had undergone nephrectomy . Therefore it is unknown if similar survival benefit could be achieved without CN with these new targeted agents . At the same time there is a need to better understand mechanisms of primary and secondary resistance to TKIs in mRCC patients and to identify eighter prognostic and predictive biomarkers to better define risk factors and potentially druggable targets .","Two randomized trials in the cytokine era clearly showed that CN had a role in mRCC increasing life expectancy . The survival benefit of TKIs including first-line sunitinib and pazopanib in mRCC has been demonstrated , but the majority of patients enrolled in the pivotal phase III studies had undergone nephrectomy.Therefore it is unknown if similar survival benefit could be achieved without CN with these new targeted agents . At the same time there is a need to better understand mechanisms of primary and secondary resistance to TKIs in mRCC patients and to identify eighter prognostic and predictive biomarkers to better define risk factors and potentially druggable targets . The hypothesis of this study is that CN followed by TKIs will improve overall survival ( OS ) when compared to TKIs alone in subjects with mRCC . Circulating blood biomarkers ( CBBs ) promise to become non-invasive real-time surrogates for tissue-based biomarkers . Circulating tumor cells ( CTCs ) shed from both primary tumors and metastases , and circulating tumor DNA ( ctDNA ) released into the bloodstream from dying tumor cells , are likely to capture the entire tumor heterogeneity providing a clear picture of the tumor genetic landscape . Moreover , CTCs fluctuations reflect and possibly anticipate treatment outcome . Through comparison of CBBs before and after disease becomes refractory to therapy , the investigators would be able to address challenging research questions regarding TKIs resistance mechanisms . This study was designed to compare clinical benefit as measured by Overall Survival ( OS ) , progression-free survival ( PFS ) , overall response rate ( ORR ) and safety provided by CN followed by TKIs vs upfront TKIs in mRCC subjects.To prospectively collect blood samples from patients at commencement of TKIs therapy and on development of resistance , with the purpose of analyzing CTCs and ctDNA mutational profile to highlight mechanisms underlying TKIs resistance . The investigators additionally aim to assess the role of CTCs as prognostic and pharmacodynamic biomarkers and prospectively collect demographic and clinical outcome data so that molecular and pathological analyses can be measured against clinical endpoints . Rationale for TKIs treatment choice : Pazopanib and sunitinib were compared to each other as a therapy for previously untreated patients with mRCC within the phase 3 non inferiority COMPARZ trial which represented the first-ever head-to-head comparison of first-line treatments for mRCC . Overall , the median PFS and OS with pazopanib compared to sunitinib were statistically non-inferior , showing that both agents are active and provide similar high quality care . For this reason the TKI will be assigned based on patients characteristics according to the guidelines of every single institution involved in the study . Statistical plan : The sample size was calculated in order to compare 5-year OS between subjects randomized to receive CN followed by TKIs and subjects randomized to receive TKIs ( main study endpoint ) . A total of 191 deaths will yield 80 % power to detect a hazard ratio of 1.5 of TKIs vs. CN followed by TKIs with an overall type 1 error of 0.05 ( two-sided log-rank test ) . Such a hazard ratio ( HR ) corresponds to an increase in the 5-year OS , from an anticipated value 10 % for TKIs to 21.5 % for CN followed by TKIs . The investigators estimate that approximately 270 patients ( 135 in each arm ) , recruited over 3 years and with a minimum follow up of 2 years , will be necessary to see the necessary number of deaths . An interim analysis of OS based on O'Brien-Fleming stopping rules is planned at 96 deaths at approximately 34 months after randomisation .",2015-08-04,"November 12, 2018","Inclusion Criteria : Written informed consent ECOG Performance Status 0-1 Favorable or intermediate MSKCC or Heng risk score Biopsy ( primary tumour or metastases ) confirming the diagnosis of predominantly clear cell RCC Resectable asymptomatic in situ primary ( asymptomatic primary is defined as the absence of symptoms which can be exclusively assigned to the primary tumor such as flank pain and/or gross hematuria necessitating blood transfusion . ) Tumour suitable to nephrectomy in the opinion of the urologist .

The investigators evaluated the efficiency of the combination of fish oil omega 3 fatty acids to different doses with the Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes ( TLC ) diet of the National Cholesterol Education Program on the profile of lipids and the corporal weight in patients with HIV treated with HAART .","The infection by Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) or Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ( AIDS ) , is a chronic condition transmissible and progressive type of viral cause , in which a link is very different between host and virus , which ultimately influences the appearance of opportunistic morbid processes or rare tumors , or both1 . With a prevalence of 3 cases for every 1000 people from 15 to 49 years , Mexico ranks 16th place in the prevalence of HIV/AIDS in adults in Latin America2 . The state of Jalisco , México , occupies the fourth place in terms of positive cases of HIV-AIDS , in this same plane , the municipalities of Guadalajara , Zapopan , Tlaquepaque and Puerto Vallarta in Jalisco , represent the main populations with the highest number of positive cases by HIV-AIDS . The HIV positive individuals with Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy ( HAART ) or without treatment are facing numerous challenges in terms of management of their health ; some of the most disturbing changes are visible in the shape and appearance of the body . In most cases this anatomical changes come accompanied by alterations in biochemical indicators : lipid levels ( cholesterol and triglycerides ) and insulin resistance4.These adverse effects may have important clinical implications , such as severe lactic acidosis , coronary artery disease and acute pancreatitis5 . In patients with HIV and HAART has published an incidence of hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia between 5 and 90 % depending on the series , although the true incidence is yet to be determined6 . Pharmacological interventions with statins or fibrates in patients infected with HIV are limited partially due to the drug interactions and increase in the frequency of adverse effects7 . Therefore , it is necessary to investigate new alternatives for the management of dyslipidemia in patients infected with HIV with HAART through changes in diet and supplements of fish oil omega 3 fatty acids . Methods Patients : The investigators enrolled 100 Patients positive to Human Immunodeficiency Virus or Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome , and had been receiving ≥2 Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy , and with diagnostic of dislipidemia according the Mexican Official Standard Norms of 2002 , for the prevention , treatment and control of dyslipidemias8 .

VA Office of Research and Development,NCT02455336,Fenofibrate Treatment in SCI,VA Office of Research and Development,2,1,Spinal Cord Injury,Drug,Fenofibrate,Treatment,,"Cardiovascular disease-related morbidity in persons with spinal cord injury ( SCI ) occurs earlier in life , at a greater prevalence than that of the general population , and is the primary cause of death after the first year of injury . During the chronic phase of SCI , a characteristic dyslipidemia emerges , which is characterized by low serum high density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL-C ) concentrations , with values often qualifying to be an independent risk factor for coronary artery disease , and elevations in serum triglycerides ( TG ) . Serum low density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations in those with SCI are usually similar to those of the general population . The current proposal in persons with SCI aims to determine the safety and efficacy of short-term fenofibrate treatment , an anti-lipid medication whose primary action lowers serum TG and raises serum HDL-C levels .","Although considered a modifiable risk factor for coronary artery disease ( CAD ) in the general population , the magnitude of physical activity required to promote cardiorespiratory fitness and a clinically meaningful change in blood-derived biomarkers of CAD is not achievable in those with a severe physical disability , such as with immobilizing paralysis from spinal cord injury ( SCI ) . During the chronic phase of SCI , a characteristic dyslipidemia emerges , with mean serum high density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL-C ) concentrations < 40 mg/dl , a threshold level for HDL-C that is appreciated to be an independent risk factor for CAD , elevations in triglycerides ( TG ) to concentrations at , or near , target values for the general population that trigger clinical intervention , and low density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) concentrations that are within the normal range . It should not be a surprise that cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) -related morbidity in persons with SCI occurs earlier in life , at a greater prevalence than that of the general population , and is the primary cause of death after the first year of injury . Population-based epidemiological studies are unavailable for clinical guidance because of the relatively low incidence rates for SCI . Clinical target values used to initiate treatment in the general population may be inappropriate in those with SCI because of their unique pathophysiology . In the absence of significant physical activity and lifestyle modifications , it would seem that appropriate pharmaceutical options are needed to properly manage markers of CVD-related risk in persons with SCI . To date , there is limited empirical evidence to support the use of lipid-lowering treatments in persons with SCI . Fenofibrate is a fibric acid derivate that activates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor and lipoprotein lipase , leading to enhanced elimination of TG from plasma . In clinical trials where fenofibrate was used as a monotherapy , serum TG concentrations fell 41-53 % , very low density lipoprotein ( VLDL ) fell 38-52 % , LDL-C decreased 6-20 % , and HDL-C improved by as much as 20 % . In consideration for the nature of dyslipidemia in persons with SCI , fenofibrate appears to be an appropriate first-line agent for treatment in this cohort , especially because most of those with SCI have LDL values that are within the clinically acceptable range . In the general population , standard clinical practice for lipid-lowering treatment with fenofibrate monotherapy follows a known and clinically accepted timeline to monitor safety and to determine therapeutic efficacy . It is recommended that , if after 2 months of continuous therapy there are no beneficial changes to the lipoprotein profile , that treatment be discontinued ( i.e. , non-responders ) . Similarly , several large clinical trials have demonstrated that the peak therapeutic effects of fenofibrate are observed after 12-16 weeks of treatment ( i.e. , responders ) . The proposed study will test the efficacy of administering fenofibrate to persons with SCI , a severely immobilized cohort that does not have established clinical practice guidelines to treat dyslipidemia and appears to have unique considerations that may be hypothesized to call for a more disease-specific approach for care . If successful , the treatment will reduce clinical markers of CVD-related risk by modifying the concentration and number of particles that are known to contribute to incident cardiac events and mortality . It is anticipated that the insight gained from this investigation will provide clinicians with a proof-of-concept for instituting appropriate use of lipid lowering agents to treat the dyslipidemia that has been well described in persons with SCI .",2015-05-14,"June 7, 2019","Inclusion Criteria : Male or female , age 21 to 69 ; Chronic ( e.g. , duration of injury at least 6 months ) , stable SCI ( regardless of level of neurological lesion ) ; American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale ( AIS ) designation of A , B or C ; and TG concentration 135 mg/dl ( paraplegia ) or 115 mg/dl ( tetraplegia ) .

Half the saline group will receive TC saline and half will receive EP saline . 30 HIV infected male and female volunteers aged 18-45 years , who have been on ART for at least 6 months with 2 or more HIV plasma viral load measurements < 50 copies HIV RNA/ml prior to enrolment . The investigational HIV-1 vaccine GTU®-MultiHIV B clade encodes for a MultiHIV antigen which is a synthetic fusion protein consisting of full-length polypeptides of Rev , Nef , Tat , p17 and p24 and containing more than 20 Th and CTL epitopes of protease , reverse transcriptase ( RT ) and gp160 regions of the HAN2 HIV-1 B clade . Vaccine is provided in sealed vials at 2mg/ml , and a single 1ml IM injection of 2mg GTU®-MultiHIV DNA IM ( into the thigh ) is required to deliver a 2mg dose . Individuals in Group 2 will receive a further 0.4mg GTU®-MultiHIV DNA in 0.2ml administered by TC , a novel needle-free method of vaccine delivery .","The investigators are exploring combination regimens with the overall aims of ( i ) optimising immune responses and ( ii ) developing safe and well tolerated strategies which will favour the development of T-cell responses that may enhance anti-HIV HIV therapy with the forward looking goal of working towards functional eradication of infection . The investigator proposes to combine the previously used IM and TC methods because preclinical data suggest that the combination of methods will favour the development of CD8 T cell responses . All groups will receive 6.0mg of the vaccine IM given in 3 doses over 12 weeks . Group 1 will receive the 6.0mg IM with electroporation ( EP ) and Group 2 will receive the 6.0mg IM without EP but together with an additional 1.2mg vaccine TC . The primary immunogenicity endpoint will be to determine whether either intervention group augments the cellular responses to vaccine specific peptides in relation to baseline . It is anticipated that none of subjects receiving saline placebo would have an increase in vaccine specific responses relative to those at baseline .

"Bama GeVe, S.L.U.",NCT02512601,Prospective Evaluation of the QoL of Patients With PTS Who Receive Compression Therapy and Sulodexide,"Bama GeVe, S.L.U.",4,0,Post-thrombotic Syndrome,Drug,Sulodexide,Other,,"This study aims to evaluate whether , in a standardised cohort of patients with mild to moderate PTS , monitored for a sufficiently long follow-up period , quality of life measured by generic instruments and disease-specific instruments evolves favourably in this patient profile . Study objective : to evaluate the evolution of quality of life in general and in the specific context of the disease of patients who have experienced an episode of deep-vein thrombosis ( DVT ) , are affected by post-thrombotic syndrome , are subject to compression therapy and receive an additional standard venoactive agent ( sulodexide 15 mg twice daily during 6 months ) .","Chronic venous insufficiency , or chronic venous disease ( CVD ) , after prior deep-vein thrombosis ( DVT ) , is diagnosed as post-thrombotic syndrome ( PTS ) . It has been calculated that PTS occurs in between 20 % and 50 % of patients after an episode of DVT , even after having received optimal anticoagulant treatment , and this disorder usually consolidates in the first 2 years after the acute thrombotic episode . The presentation of PTS varies from mild symptoms or clinical signs to severe presentations in approximately 10 % of cases , including chronic pain in the limbs that limits activity and ability to work , untreatable oedema and ulcers in the legs . The cornerstone of the treatment of consolidated PTS is compression treatment , especially in the form of elastic compression stockings , and frequent elevation of the leg , despite the low level of evidence , but these measures require the strictest possible therapeutic compliance on the part of the patient . There is still little evidence that `` venoactive '' agents are effective in PTS symptoms ; nevertheless , the use of medications in PTS is very widespread . In a study by González- Fajardo et al. , the use of compression stockings is described in 75 % of patients and , in a study by Lozano -Sánchez et al. , their use is described in 62 % of patients . In the latter study , venoactive drugs were used in approximately 90 % of patients . The diagnosis , staging , prognosis and evolution of the severity of the various entities grouped together under the heading of CVD , including PTS , are based mainly on scales and scoring systems . Objective evaluation of CVD severity tends to be based on the `` clinical , etiologic , anatomic and pathophysiologic '' ( CEAP ) clinical classification , the Venous Clinical Severity Score ( VCSS ) and the Villalta score . Nevertheless , at the present time it is recognised that the assessment of severity does not necessarily coincide with the perception that patients themselves have of their quality of life , which is estimated with generic questionnaires ( such as the abbreviated 36-item Short-Form Health Survey questionnaire Short Form ( SF-36 ) and disease-specific questionnaires ( such as the Venous Insufficiency Epidemiological and Economic Study questionnaire ( VEINES-QOL ) . Various studies used some of these scales , usually more than one . All the studies agree that patients with PTS have a lower QoL than those without PTS , and this is shown by both generic and specific instruments . Nonetheless , the population examined in the studies was extremely heterogeneous with respect to use of compression treatment , use of drugs and duration of observations . The problem that remains to be solved is whether the therapeutic measures applied lead to a change in the QoL measured by generic and disease-specific instruments over a relatively long treatment period . Achieving favourable changes in patients ' perception of quality of life remains fundamental for therapeutic compliance and for a suitable physician-patient relationship in the treatment of any chronic disease , and therefore in PTS . This matter can be properly examined , first , in a cohort of patients that is as standardised as possible with respect to the stage and seriousness of the disease and the use of compression treatment and pharmacological treatment . The standardisation of the stage and seriousness of the disease , as well as the means of standardising the compression treatment , can be achieved with appropriate inclusion and exclusion criteria . As pharmacological treatment is generally administered , sulodexide was chosen for purposes of standardisation . This is a venoactive treatment with antithrombotic , profibrinolytic and endothelium-protective activity , already being used in PTS patients with favourable results . The guidelines of the Society for Vascular Surgery , the American Venous Forum and the American College of Chest Physicians ( ACCP ) include it among the recommended pharmacological treatments , along with compression , for patients with manifest chronic venous disease . Standardisation of the determination of QoL is envisaged using the generic questionnaire SF-36 and the disease-specific questionnaire VEINES-QOL . In this way , this study aims to evaluate whether , in a standardised cohort of patients with mild to moderate PTS , monitored for a sufficiently long follow-up period , quality of life measured by generic instruments and disease-specific instruments evolves favourably in this patient profile . If this is the case , a different approach to the treatment of the disease will be necessary .",2015-07-27,"August 30, 2017","Inclusion Criteria : Patients ≥ 18 years , ≤ 75 years , of both genders and any ethnic group .

Nationwide Children's Hospital,NCT02512809,Isoflurane-induced Neuroinflammation in Children With Hydrocephalus,Nationwide Children's Hospital,3,0,Toxicity,Drug,Isoflurane,Prevention,,The investigators will quantify inflammatory biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) and serum of children with hydrocephalus who are undergoing ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement under isoflurane anesthesia .,"Background & Significance . Each year , millions of children receive general anesthesia . Isoflurane , a GABA type A ( GABAA ) receptor agonist is an inhaled anesthetic commonly used in clinical anesthesia practice worldwide . Anesthetics traditionally have been assumed to be safe as long as severe hypotension and hypoxia are avoided . Interfering with the balance of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters in the developing brain may interfere with the formation of synaptic connections and enhance the normal apoptotic processes that lead to neuronal pruning and may induce neuroinflammation . Such enhanced neuronal pruning and neuroinflammation could lead to excessive neuronal loss at critical times during brain development and consequently cause later learning disabilities . Recent reports of neurotoxicity induced with isoflurane have triggered significant concern about the safety of this agent . Investigations into neuroinflammation and apoptosis after anesthetic exposure in human children have been limited due to ethical and methodological concerns . Studies that have been done have been largely retrospective , population-based studies . Results from these studies have been mixed , some showing a decline in neurocognitive performance , some showing no change . Further , the vast majority of prospective , hypothesis-driven research has been undertaken in animal models . Developing a clinically relevant animal model and testing resultant hypotheses in humans are critical steps in determining the underlying cause of these changes as well as identifying possible therapeutic targets . The investigators hypothesize that piglets exposed to commonly used anesthetics will exhibit increased neuroinflammation when compared with controls . It is further hypothesized children undergoing neurosurgery with isoflurane anesthesia will show evidence of increased central nervous system inflammation . Finally , the investigators hypothesize that significantly less robust inflammation will be seen in patients undergoing MRI with general anesthesia ( no surgery ) , indicating a role of surgical stress in the modulation of isoflurane-induced neuroinflammation . Clinical/Translational Investigation ( NCH ) : Surgery Group . Patients aged 0-5 years undergoing general anesthesia for ventriculoperitoneal shunt ( VPS ) repair will have CSF and serum sampled at the beginning of surgery ( after induction but before surgical incision ) and at the end of surgery ( after closure but before emergence ) . Each of these patients will be randomized to a standardized anesthetic . An additional CSF sample will be taken prior to post anesthesia care unit ( PACU ) discharge . These samples will be analyzed as described above . Control Group . Patients undergoing diagnostic MRI under general anesthesia for non-neurologic pathology will receive a standardized anesthetic . Serum will be collected at the beginning and end of the procedure and will be analyzed for inflammation as above . Short term goals : Demonstrate that isoflurane has a role in modulation of neuroinflammation in humans . Determine if surgical stress also has a role in modulation of this inflammation . Develop a clinically relevant animal model for hypothesis-driven anesthetic neuroinflammation research . Long term goals : Identify which anesthetic regimens , if any , are safe for use in the developing brain . Identify therapeutic targets for prevention or treatment of anesthetic-induced neuroinflammation . Obtain independent federal funding for future research and establish an experimental neuroscience program on the Nationwide Children 's campus .",2015-02-23,"December 12, 2018","Inclusion Criteria ( HC study patients ) : Pediatric patients , aged 6 months-less than 11 years , diagnosed with hydrocephalus undergoing a primary surgical ( non-bedside ) shunting procedure with general anesthesia .

In recent years , soft tissue substitutes , such as acellular dermal matrix or collagen matrix have been proposed to increase the dimensions of peri implant soft tissues ; however , further studies have demonstrated that the allograft materials were less effective and less predictable than autogenous soft tissue grafts , in terms of increasing attached keratinized tissue , due to the considerable shrinkage and inconsistent quality of the attached tissue gained ; consequently soft tissue graft from the palate are currently considered the gold standard for augmenting peri implant soft . Some clinical studies proposed the association of contour augmentation by guided bone regeneration ( GBR ) with implant placement . The aim of these procedures is to restore the missing volume and to establish a facial bone wall of sufficient height and thickness to serve as a support for peri implant soft tissues ; in these terms , GBR could be considered important to increase the stability of peri implant soft tissue , preventing the marginal soft tissue shrinkage and the following exposition of implant . This could be a valid approach to stabilize coronal peri implant soft tissue and at the same time less traumatic than grafting procedures .",2015-07-03,"July 29, 2015",Inclusion Criteria : one missing tooth in the anterior maxilla facial keratinized mucosa thickness of at least 2mm Exclusion Criteria : heavy smokers systemic diseases,32,0,18 Years,75 Years
Medical City Children's Hospital,NCT02519335,Use of the Cardioprotectant Dexrazoxane During Congenital Heart Surgery: Proposal for Pilot Investigation,Medical City Children's Hospital,1,0,"Heart Defects, Congenital",Drug,Dexrazoxane,Treatment,,"Cardiopulmonary bypass and arrest of the heart during cardiac surgery are necessary to allow the surgeon to perform heart operations . However , these processes can cause injury to the heart which may worsen post-operative outcomes . In fact , the effects of these injuries may continue after surgery , and lead to a long-term decrease in heart function . Neonates and young infants are at particular risk for this occurrence . While much research has been done in adults looking for medicines that might protect the heart during surgery , few studies have been conducted in neonates and young infants . The investigators are testing Dexrazoxane , which has proven to be cardio-protective in pediatric cancer patients , in the hope that it may lessen cardiac injury during and after congenital heart surgery , and thereby improve outcomes in the neonatal and young infant population . In order to accomplish this , the investigators must first determine how Dexrazoxane can be safely administered to young children with congenital heart disease . Therefore , the investigators are performing a pilot study of 12 children to assess : how Dexrazoxane at 3 different doses is metabolized in the body of a child age 0-6 months during and after congenital heart surgery , and the safety of Dexrazoxane use in the neonatal and young infant population undergoing cardiac surgery .","Neonates and infants undergoing heart surgery with cardioplegic arrest experience both inflammation and myocardial ischemia-reperfusion [ IR ] injury . These processes provoke myocardial apoptosis and oxygen free radical formation which result in cardiac injury and dysfunction . Dexrazoxane is a derivative of EDTA that is approved for prevention of anthracycline-related cardiotoxicity . It provides cardioprotection through reduction of toxic reactive oxygen species [ ROS ] , and suppression of apoptosis . The deleterious effects of cardiopulmonary bypass [ CPB ] with cardioplegic arrest of the heart during congenital heart operations greatly influence postoperative morbidity and mortality . Neonates and infants undergoing cardiac surgery experience both a systemic inflammatory response , and myocardial IR injury as cardioplegic arrest is reversed . These processes provoke elaboration of cytokines and activation of the complement cascade , as well as oxygen free radical formation and induction of myocardial apoptosis ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) . Frequently , myocardial injury and cardiac dysfunction ensue , leading to low cardiac output syndrome and multi-system organ failure . The irreversible component of these injuries , in addition to the abnormal workloads imposed on the myocardium from the anatomic defects themselves , may have consequences for long-term cardiac function , and may in part explain contractile dysfunction observed late after congenital heart The investigators propose a pilot pharmacokinetic/safety trial of dexrazoxane in children 0-6 months of age , followed by a randomized , double-blind , clinical trial of dexrazoxane vs placebo during congenital heart surgery . The investigators will evaluate postoperative time to resolution of organ failure , development of low cardiac output syndrome , length of cardiac ICU and hospital stays , and echocardiographic indices of cardiac dysfunction . Results could establish the safety and clinical utility of dexrazoxane in ameliorating ischemia-reperfusion injury during congenital heart surgery .",2015-05-14,"July 24, 2018","Inclusion Criteria : age 6 months and under open heart surgery requiring CPB and use of cardioplegia parent/guardian consent for study obtained surgery planned Monday to Friday Exclusion Criteria : gestational age < 36weeks known syndrome or genetic abnormality , except Trisomy 21 single ventricle physiology concurrent enrollment in another research protocol no parental/guardian consent obtained ECMO utilization prior to surgery or necessary at the time of ICU admission",12,0,1 Day,6 Months

Given the strong evidence for the negative trajectory of individuals with co-occurring ADHD and substance use initiation , the goal of this study is to conduct a controlled examination of a brief , early intervention ( BEI ) for substance modified for adolescents with ADHD . Importantly , this intervention will address individuals who are at risk for problems with substance use , but do not yet meet criteria for severe SUD . Although brief interventions have been found to be effective in other populations , their efficacy in an ADHD population with emerging risk for substance use problems remains uninvestigated . This study aims to understand why some adolescents with ADHD and elevated risk for SUD respond to ( BEI ) and others do not . The investigators will test whether situational and individual characteristics predict substance use development and response to treatment . Further , this study will assess which types of additional treatment are most effective for youth who do not respond to the initial BEI . It is hypothesized that rates of adolescent substance use will be lower among adolescents who participate in study treatments .","The goal of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a brief early intervention ( BEI ) for reducing early alcohol and marijuana use in a group of 300 adolescents ( age 12-16 ) with ADHD . All adolescents will receive the BEI based on the Teen Intervene program with the addition of enhanced decision making skills . Due to the existing support for the intervention and concern for randomizing families with adolescents at risk for worsening substance use outcomes into a control ( no treatment ) condition for one to two years , no control condition is used in the current design at the first level of intervention . Similarly , due to the time required to see a potential effect of the treatment ( 6 months post-brief intervention ) , a wait-list control condition was not considered . Adolescents will be evaluated for treatment non-response at 6 , 9 , 12 , 15 , and 18 months post-treatment . Non-response is defined as non-normative use of alcohol , marijuana , or other drugs during the past 90 days . Tobacco products are excluded from consideration . Adolescents who demonstrate non-response to the initial BEI at any of the follow-up assessments will be randomized to one of the following conditions : 1 ) Continued monitoring of substance use with no additional treatment 2 ) Parent training and adolescent cognitive behavioral therapy ( PT/ACBT ) 3 ) PT/ACBT plus concurrent stimulant medication ( PT/ACBT + MED ) . Participants who are randomized will be assessed at 6 months post-treatment and again one year later .

It is approved for people with advanced kidney cancer . Researchers want to see if it also helps people with two other types of kidney cancer . Objective : - To see if everolimus is safe and effective in people with Birt-Hogg-Dube Syndrome ( BHD ) -associated kidney cancer or sporadic ( nonfamilial ) chromophobe renal cancer . Eligibility : - People ages 18 and over with BHD-associated kidney cancer or advanced sporadic chromophobe renal cancer . Design : Participants will be screened with : Medical history , physical exam , and blood and urine tests . Computed tomography ( CT ) scan or magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan . They will lie in a machine that takes pictures of their chest/abdomen/pelvis . They may also be screened with : Another scan , of the brain or neck . Bone scan . Positron emission tomography scan with fludeoxyglucose ( FDG-PET ) . Heart and lung tests . Tests for hepatitis . Participants will take a tablet once a day by mouth for up to a year . They will keep a diary of when they take the tablet and any symptoms . During the study , participants will have physical exams and urine and blood tests . They will have scans of the chest/abdomen/pelvis . They may have FDG-PET and bone scans . Participants will have tests for hepatitis and may have a tumor sample taken . Participants will have a follow-up visit 4-5 weeks finishing taking the drug . They will have a physical exam and blood tests . They may have scans and/or hepatitis tests . Participants will be called about every 3-6 months after the study ends to see how they are doing","Background : Birt-Hogg-Dube ( BHD ) is a hereditary cancer syndrome with clinical manifestations including cutaneous fibrofolliculomas , lung cysts/pneumothorax , and renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) . RCC occurs in approximately 30 % of patients with BHD . It presents at an early age of onset and is commonly bilateral and multifocal . Tumors associated with BHD can have variable histology , however approximately 85 % of these tumors have a chromophobe component ( either alone or part of a hybrid tumor mixed with elements of oncocytoma ) . The current management includes surgical resection with partial nephrectomy when tumors reach 3 cm . While significant morbidity can be associated with repeat , partial nephrectomy with this approach , most patients can maintain renal function and do not develop systemic disease . There are no proven systemic therapy options for BHD to date . Germline mutations in the gene Folliculin ( FLCN ) are the genetic hallmark of BHD and can be found in greater than 90 % of patients . FLCN is believed to function like a classic tumor suppressor gene with a second hit in the wild type allele ( somatic mutation or loss of heterozygosity ) occurring in the majority of renal tumors . BHD is in the family of hamartomatous disorders similar to Tuberous Sclerosis Complex ( TSC ) and Cowden Syndrome , and studies have found activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase ( PI3K ) /mTOR pathway in BHD renal tumors . FLCN is believed be part of a complex that interacts with 5 ' AMP-activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) and is involved with regulation of mTOR activity . In vitro and in vivo models of FLCN loss demonstrate activation of both mTOR complex 1 ( mTORC1 ) and mTOR complex 2 ( mTORC2 ) . Preclinical data from conditional FLCN knockout mice demonstrate that treatment with sirolimus can reverse renal manifestations . We hypothesize that mTOR inhibition with everolimus treatment will be clinically active in BHD associated RCC . Objectives : -To determine the overall response rate with everolimus treatment in subjects with BHD-associated renal tumors . Eligibility : -Patients with renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) associated with Birt-Hogg-Dube Syndrome ( BHD ) . Design : This is an open label , phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of everolimus therapy in patients with BHD associated renal tumors . Up to 16 evaluable patients will be enrolled . Tumor response rate will be measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) and efficacy analysis will be done . Secondary endpoints will evaluate growth rates ( cm/year ) while on therapy . Additionally , reduction in the size of lung cysts and cutaneous fibrofolliculomas will be evaluated .",2015-07-21,"March 7, 2019","INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients must have a clinical diagnosis of Birt-Hogg-Dub ( Copyright ) Syndrome ( clinical features consistent with BHD and /or a germline Folliculin ( FLCN ) mutation ) and the presence of localized , locally advanced or advanced , renal tumor ( s ) .

Omacetaxine will be given subcutaneously Q12 hours on Days 1-7 . The optimally safe and active dose ( OD ) will be determined using the EffTox design . EffTox is a Bayesian adaptive design that seeks to determine the optimal dose for further study in Phase II by considering a trade-off between efficacy and toxicity . The EffTox design begins by treating a cohort of three patients at dose level 1 . These patients ' efficacy and toxicity outcomes are used to update the posterior distributions for the probability of efficacy and toxicity and identify acceptable dose levels . The study terminates if no dose levels are acceptable . Otherwise , the acceptable doses are ranked using the Euclidean distance from ( 1.0 , 0.0 ) and the next cohort is treated at the dose with the minimum distance under the restriction that we may only escalate or deescalate by one dose level at a time ( e.g. , the second cohort can only escalate to dose level 2 or deescalate to dose level -1 ) . The second cohort is treated at the dose with the minimum distance and posterior distributions , and the list of acceptable doses and distances are updated as before . This process continues until at least 20 subjects are enrolled in the study . The dose with the minimum distance at study completion is considered the optimal dose for further investigation . If none of the dose levels are acceptable at study completion , an optimal dose level will not be identified and the drug does not warrant further investigation . Post induction therapy will consist of standard cytarabine consolidation chemotherapy or allogeneic stem cell transplantation based on pretreatment risk assessment .",2015-05-07,"July 1, 2021","Inclusion Criteria : Newly diagnosed , untreated patients with AML according to the WHO classification for AML .

University of Johannesburg,NCT02409264,The Effect of Individualised Homeopathic Treatment of Insomnia Disorder in Females,University of Johannesburg,2,1,Insomnia Disorder,Other,Individualised Homeopathic Remedy,Treatment,,"In South Africa , 27 % of adult males and 31 % of adult females experience insomnia . Insomnia may lead to feelings of fatigue and sleepiness , mood disturbances , cognitive difficulties , and may exacerbate symptomatology of co-morbid diseases . Current conventional treatment for insomnia includes both psychological and drug therapies . These conventional medications potentially may lead to dependency and withdrawal symptoms . Individualised homeopathic treatment is a process in which a homeopath selects the most appropriate remedy for the treatment of a condition in accordance with the fundamental principles of homeopathy . This treatment protocol may offer safe and effective treatment for insomnia disorder , however , more research is required on the subject . The aim of this study is to determine the effect of individualised homeopathic treatment of insomnia disorder in females using detailed case studies and the Insomnia Severity Index .","This study will be of an embedded mixed method case study design , conducted at the University of Johannesburg Doornfontein Homeopathic Health Clinic over a period of 8 weeks . Ten female participants , aged 18 to 45 years , will be recruited by means of non-probability purposive sampling via advertisements placed in the University of Johannesburg Homeopathic Health Clinic and in pharmacies around Johannesburg , with the relevant permission given . The nature of the study , as well as the requirements for participation will be fully explained and the volunteers will be asked to sign the Participant Information and Consent Form once they agree to participate . Potential participants will undergo a brief screening to determine if they meet the requirements for this study . The participants that meet the inclusion criteria will attend the initial consultation and those that do not meet the inclusion criteria will be referred to the Homeopathic Health Clinic . The consultation will consist of a comprehensive homeopathic case history , the conduction of relevant physical exams , including vital signs , and the completion of the Insomnia Severity Index ( ISI ) . The participant 's case will be analysed and computer repertorised , using the Complete Repertory of Mercurius homeopathic software ( Aeon Group ) , version 5.3.0.17 . The individualised homeopathic remedy will be selected by the researcher who will refer to the appropriate Materia Medica . The Homeopathic Dispenser will dispense the homeopathic remedy to the participant . Each participant will return for four follow-up consultations which will be two weeks apart . At each follow-up consultation the ISI will be completed and a follow-up case history and physical examination of the participants ' vital signs will be conducted . The participants ' symptoms will be re-evaluated and a remedy prescribed accordingly . At the final consultation in the 8th week , no remedy will be prescribed . Data will be collected and analysed by the researcher with the assistance of a statistician at Statkon , using non-parametric tests , including : frequencies and descriptives , the Friedman test , and Wilcoxon post hoc test .

"University Hospital, Toulouse",NCT02403947,MEsenchymal StEm Cells for Multiple Sclerosis,"University Hospital, Toulouse",1,0,Multiple Sclerosis,Drug,Mesenchymal stem cells,Treatment,Quadruple,"Multiple sclerosis ( MS ) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system ( CNS ) , which ultimately leads to myelin damage and axonal loss . The disease is complex and multifactorial , but the key pathogenic event appears to be an uncontrolled response of components of the immune system ( T and B lymphocytes ) to myelin proteins . No definitive treatment is available for MS , however immunomodulatory and immunosuppressant drugs act as disease-modifying agents ( DMDs ) . Unfortunately , the current treatments demonstrate partial efficacy in targeting the deleterious immune reactions . According to the present knowledge of the pathophysiology of MS , an ideal therapeutic strategy would be to modulate or suppress the aggressive immune process , to protect axons and neurons from degeneration , and to enhance repair and facilitate remyelination . A specific form of stem cells , called adult mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs ) , has shown remarkable ability to modulate the immune response . This study will evaluate the safety of injecting MSCs in people with MS .","MSCs have the remarkable ability to modulate the immune response mainly by inhibiting proliferation of T cells and to protect injured tissues through paracrine mechanisms . There is an urgent need to evaluate the real efficacy of MSC transplantation , and its possible position in the current therapeutic armamentarium . An international panel of MS neurology and stem cell experts , as well as immunologists formed an `` International Mesenchymal Stem Cells Transplantation '' ( MSCT ) Study Group with the aim to derive a consensus on what cells should be used for transplantation and develop a treatment protocol and an experimental program that will eventually attest to the efficacy of MSC transplantation and understand the mechanism that underlie the benefit . 12 patients with MS will be treated with IV injections of autologous isolated and expanded mesenchymal stem cells .

University of Pittsburgh,NCT02400580,IV Acetaminophen for Postoperative Pain Analgesia After Laparoscopic Hysterectomy,University of Pittsburgh,4,1,Pain,Drug,IV acetaminophen,Treatment,Triple,The objective of this study is to quantify the change in post-operative pain scores and narcotic requirements in women receiving pre and post-operative IV acetaminophen compared to placebo in women undergoing laparoscopic hysterectomy .,"Gynecologic surgery has been revolutionized by the incorporation of minimally invasive techniques . Procedures that once resulted in multiple day hospital admissions are now being performed in outpatient surgery centers . Common factors that contribute to delayed discharge are inadequate postoperative pain control and increased nausea and vomiting . A multi-modal pain management approach is considered optimal at controlling postsurgical pain , which includes combining different analgesics that act in varying mechanisms . By using medications that act synergistically , the overall analgesia requirement can oftentimes be decreased . Opioids have been found to be highly effective in controlling postoperative pain ; however , are associated with dose-dependent risks including nausea , vomiting , constipation , urinary retention , sedation , and respiratory depression . Subsequently , non-opioid options are frequently desired in an attempt to minimize narcotic intake . In the United States , intravenous acetaminophen was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) in November 2010 for the management of mild to moderate pain and the reduction of fever . Since this time , multiple studies have analyzed the role of intravenous acetaminophen in both acute and postoperative pain ; however , none have been specific to laparoscopic hysterectomy . The primary study published evaluating intravenous acetaminophen in laparoscopic hysterectomies also included multiple other laparoscopic procedures from a variety of specialties including general surgery , urology , and urogynecology . In addition , the intravenous acetaminophen was started on average 19 hours after the conclusion of the case once the patient controlled analgesic was discontinued . Improved postsurgical pain control achieved with intravenous acetaminophen may potentially lead to same day discharge after major laparoscopic gynecologic procedures . Same day discharge after laparoscopic hysterectomy has been shown to be a safe option with proper patient counseling and multi-modal pain medications . In addition , same day discharge is also associated with decreased health care expenditures . With continued efforts to cut hospital costs , the pressure to discharge patients earlier continues to be high . The investigators propose that intravenous acetaminophen will improve post-operative pain control and decrease narcotic requirements for patients undergoing laparoscopic hysterectomies . Furthermore , The investigators expect to find decreased postsurgical nausea and vomiting and potentially quicker discharge to home . This could have a large impact on the field of gynecologic surgery as major procedures that once required overnight admission may now succeed at same day discharge .",2015-03-18,"May 15, 2018","Inclusion Criteria : Women aged 18-75 Ability to read and write in English ( our post-operative pain log is only available in English ) Planning a laparoscopic hysterectomy ( includes total laparoscopic hysterectomy , laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy , laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy , with or without salpingooophorectomy ) Exclusion Criteria : Answering yes to any of the following questions : `` Do you have a history of liver disease , kidney disease , hepatitis C , history of liver failure , greater than 3 drinks per day or being have you ever been told by your doctor that they should not take acetaminophen '' History of cardiac arrhythmia History of jaundice Acute abdominal inflammatory or infectious process at time of surgery Known malignancy at time of surgery Known pregnancy at time of surgery Plan to perform additional significant surgical procedure at the time of hysterectomy such as extensive excision of endometriosis on bowel or bladder or pelvic reconstructive procedure > 6cm abdominal incision in order to remove the uterus at time of study-related hysterectomy Regular use of narcotic pain medication ( defined as use on most days of the week at any point in the past 3 months ) Allergy to acetaminophen Women who weigh less than 50 kilograms on the day of surgery .",183,1,18 Years,75 Years

The 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa is the largest to date . There are no approved treatments for Ebola . Researchers want to see if two new vaccines VRC-EBOMVA079-00-VP ( MVA-EbolaZ ) and VRC-EBOADC069-00VP ( cAd3-EBO ) are safe and able to induce an immune response against Ebola . Objectives : - To see if the two new vaccines are safe and if they cause any side effects . Also , to study immune responses to the vaccines . Eligibility : - Healthy adults ages 18-66 Design : Participants will get one or two study vaccine injections depending on the study group they are assigned to . Each injection will repeat the same schedule : A needle and syringe will inject the vaccine into an upper arm muscle . 1-2 days later , participants must call the clinic to report how they feel . For 7 days they will check their temperature with a thermometer given to them . They will look at the injection site , and measure any redness or swelling with a ruler . They will write down any symptoms they have . In the first 2 months , participants will have at least 6 clinic visits and 1 phone contact . At each visit , participants will be checked for health changes or problems . They will tell how they feel and if they have taken any medications . Blood and urine samples may be collected . Participants might need to have extra clinic visits and laboratory tests if they have health changes that need to be checked .","This Phase 1/1b study will examine dose , safety , tolerability and immunogenicity of an investigational MVA-vectored Ebola vaccine in healthy adults . The vaccine encodes wild type ( WT ) glycoprotein ( GP ) from Zaire strain of Ebola and will be administered intramuscularly ( IM ) with needle and syringe . The safety and tolerability of the MVA-EbolaZ will be evaluated at escalating doses of 1x10 ( 7 ) and 1x10 ( 8 ) plaque forming units ( PFU ) . Part 1 includes enrollment of vaccine-naive subjects to conduct a dose escalation of the MVA-EbolaZ vaccine and to evaluate the vaccine as a boost for the cAd3-EBO vaccine . In Part 2 of the study , up to 140 subjects who received the cAd3-EBO or cAd3-EBOZ vaccine in VRC 207 study will be boosted with MVA-EbolaZ . The hypotheses are that the study vaccines will be safe and elicit immune responses to Ebola GP , and that the prime-boost regimens will be safe and result in a more polyfunctional response to Ebola GP that is of greater magnitude and duration than response to either of the vaccines alone .",2015-04-03,"April 10, 2019","INCLUSION CRITERIA : Inclusion Criteria for Groups 1 , 2 , and 3 .

The ARTEMIS trial is a practical multicenter , cluster- randomized clinical trial that will assess the impact of copayment reduction by equalizing the copayment of clopidogrel and ticagrelor . ARTEMIS will assess prescribing patterns , patient medication adherence , and clinical outcomes up to one year . We hypothesize that reducing out -- of -- pocket cost for P2Y12 receptor inhibitor will lead to improved adherence . Additionally , copayment reduction of both generic and brand antiplatelet agents may lead to a reduction in MACE risk . This is in part due to greater adherence to an evidence -- based secondary prevention medication . Additionally the reduction in MACE may reflect greater selection of a more potent antiplatelet agent that has been shown to reduce MACE in randomized clinical trials , as provider choice of antiplatelet therapy will be primarily driven by risk- benefit assessment rather than the cost burden to the patient .","ARTEMIS is a prospective , cluster-randomized clinical trial that will evaluate whether patient copayment elimination significantly influences antiplatelet therapy selection and long-term adherence , as well as patient outcomes and overall cost of care after acute myocardial infarction .

The secondary aim is to determine the acceptability of PCA-DEX for anxiety symptom management by patients with burn injury and nursing staff caring for these patients . Objectives Primary Aim # 1 Safety : To examine the safety of PCA-DEX as determined by the proportion of patients successfully completing the pilot trial without adverse effect which include significant hypotension , bradycardia , or agitation from uncontrolled anxiety . Primary Aim # 2 Feasibility : The primary objective of this study is to establish feasibility of subject recruitment and protocol adherence in a pilot study of PCA-DEX in patients with burn injury requiring dressing changes . Feasibility will be defined by the following criteria : a ) number and proportion of patients who consent to enrollment , b ) proportion of eligible subjects enrolled prior to first dressing change , c ) number of days on protocol that patients successfully use the PCS device , d ) ability of burn nurses to adjust the pump and adhere to the infusion rates of the PCA-DEX protocol . Secondary Aim # 1 Patient Acceptability : A secondary objective of this pilot study is to have patients evaluate PCA-DEX in regards to patients ' willingness to use PCA-DEX prior to and during burn dressing changes to self-manage anxiety and their satisfaction ratings with anxiety self-management . Secondary Aim # 2 Nurse Acceptability : Another secondary aim of this pilot study is to evaluate the nursing staffs ' acceptability of the PCA-DEX protocol for patients ' to self-manage anxiety surrounding burn care dressing changes . Hypotheses # 1 : PCA-DEX protocol will be safe to administer during burn care dressing changes . # 2 : PCA-DEX will be feasible to implement on the Burn Center at OSUWMC . # 3 : Patients will favorably appraise PCA-DEX for the self-control of anxiety associated with burn care dressing changes , and be satisfied with PCA-DEX for the management of anxiety . # 4 : Nursing Staff will favorably appraise PCA-DEX while performing burn care dressing changes .","Study Procedures Dexmedetomidine PCA Protocol : The PCA-DEX dosing algorithm will consist of a loading dose ( 0.25 mcg/kg ) given intravenously over 10 minutes , administered 10 minutes prior to the start of burn wound care , followed by a continuous basal infusion of 0.4 mcg/kg/hr with 6 allowable patient-controlled self-boluses per hour ( 0.1 mcg/kg ) each with a 10-minute lock-out . Drs . Larry Jones and J. Kevin Bailey or their designate will write the PCA-DEX medication orders . Subjects will receive standard opioid therapy ( oral oxycodone/acetaminophen 5/325 mg 60 min . prior and IV morphine 4-12 mg or hydromorphone IV 0.5-1.5 mg 5 to 10 min . prior and buccal fentanyl 400 mcg as needed during burn wound care ) and can receive bolus supplemental sedative medications ( benzodiazepines ) as ordered by Drs . Jones or Bailey if needed in the judgment of the burn-care nurse . Subjects will be monitored closely by research personnel during the first burn wound care session from 1 hour prior to 1 hour after completion of burn wound care . Every heart rate and blood pressure recordings will be abstracted from the medical record from 1 hour prior to through 1 hour after completion of the daily burn wound dressing changes for days 1 through 5 . Alert adverse events will be reported by research personnel or the patient-care nurse to first the attending physician and then to the safety monitor . Nurse alert parameters to notify the attending physician and independent safety monitor include : heart rate ( HR ) 10 min ; systolic BP 140 mm Hg sustained for > 10 minutes ; diastolic BP 90 mm Hg sustained for > 10 minutes , respiratory rate 10 minutes or oxygen saturation 10 minutes ; or persistent inability to understand rationale for triggering the PCA device despite education and demonstration . If the study subject has evidence of sustained hemodynamic instability ( HR < 60 bpm , SBP < 90 mmHg or DBP < 50 mmHg ) during the daily pre-procedure assessment , the patient will not be eligible to receive study drug on that day . For that day the patient will receive standard of care as appropriate instead of the study intervention . The patient will then be reassessed prior to the subsequent study days to determine eligibility for study drug up through day 5 . Data Collection Measures and Procedures Study entry demographic and descriptive data : Data to be recorded includes : age , gender , race , ethnicity , admission weight , severity of burn injury , burn etiology , total body surface area burned and depth of injury , and all home and hospital medications . Daily Measures on Protocol . The following will be obtained from enrolled patients each day by a member of the research team . Overall anxiety and pain . The abbreviated Burn Specific Anxiety and Pain Scale ( BSAPS ) on day 1 , 1 hour prior to the first burn dressing change . Procedural Anxiety . Anxiety , defined as a state marked by apprehension , agitation , increased motor activity , arousal , and fearful withdrawal will be obtained from subjects . Patients will evaluate current anxiety level 1 hour before and 1 hour after each burn dressing change using a 100-mm Visual Analogue scale-anxiety ( VAS-A ) . Subjects will be asked to rate their current level of anxiety on the VAS-A in response to , `` How anxious are you feeling today ? '' A 100-millimeter vertical line will be anchored on each end by statements 'not anxious at all ' to 'the most anxious I have ever been ' . The VAS-A will have a vertical orientation , as it is more sensitive and easier for subjects to use , particularly for those with a narrowed visual field or when under stress . Subjects will be asked to mark their current anxiety level on the vertical line . Scores will be derived by the distance in millimeters from the bottom anchor to the mark placed by the subject , yielding interval level data . Reason ( s ) for not obtaining a daily anxiety assessment will be recorded . The proportion of those assessments completed and reasons for non-completion will be used to inform strategies to minimize missing data for our planned randomized clinical trial . Procedural Pain . Patients ' will evaluate current pain level 1 hour before and 1 hour after each burn dressing change using a 100-mm Visual Analogue Scale-Pain . Patients will be asked to rate their current level of pain on the VAS-P in response to `` How much pain are you having right now ? '' A 100-millimeter vertical line will be anchored on each end by statements of 'no pain at all ' to 'the most pain I have ever experienced ' . As with the VAS-A , the vertical orientation has been chosen due to increased sensitivity and ease of use for patients.Subjects will be asked to mark their current pain level on the vertical line . Scores will be derived by the distance in millimeters from the bottom anchor to the mark placed by the subject , yielding interval level data . Reason ( s ) for not obtaining the pain assessments will be recorded . The proportion of those assessments completed and reasons for non-completion will be used to inform strategies to minimize missing data for our planned randomized clinical trial . Protocol adherence . A checklist will be completed daily to monitor the number of days subjects are able to use the PCA device for up to 5 days . A checklist will also be used to monitor the ability of the burn-nurses to adhere to the PCA protocol per instructions . Daily adverse event monitoring . Research staff will record and report the presence of hypotension , bradycardia ( known adverse effects of dexmedetomidine ) , and protocol deviations related to drug , pump or both . Heart rate and blood pressure will be abstracted from the medical record . Research team staff or burn-nurses caring for PCA-DEX subjects will alert the attending physician and the safety monitor for HR 10 min ; systolic BP 140 mm Hg sustained for > 10 minutes ; diastolic BP 90 mm Hg sustained for > 10 minutes , respiratory rate 10 minutes or oxygen saturation 10 minutes during the period 1 hour prior through 1 hour after completion of burn wound dressing change on days 1-5 for any necessary intervention or protocol withdrawal .

LMU Klinikum,NCT02548611,Comparison of Loading Strategies With Antiplatelet Drugs in Patients Undergoing Elective Coronary Intervention,LMU Klinikum,4,0,Angina Pectoris,Drug,Prasugrel,Treatment,Single,Use of high loading doses of clopidogrel ( antiplatelet drug ) just before coronary interventions is associated with improved outcomes after coronary stenting . However the onset of platelet inhibition after clopidogrel loading takes 2 to 4 hours and its action if very variable . A way to overcome this limitation is loading with a more potent antiplatelet drug such as prasugrel .

Participants will be followed postoperatively during their entire hospital stay to determine the effectiveness of Pecs II block and opioids versus placebo Pecs II block and opioids as postoperative pain treatment .","Each year , 9400 new cases of breast cancer are diagnosed in Belgium . It makes breast cancer the most common cancer in women , good for more than one third of all cancer cases in women . Surgical excision of the tumour is a necessary and effective step to cure from the disease . Recent studies have demonstrated the positive effects of regional anesthesia on peroperative and postoperative pain . Paravertebral blocks have become popular as an alternative to the analgesia provided by the 'gold standard ' of thoracic epidural analgesia . However , both regional techniques have complications and slow learning curves that make them unsuitable for the large proportion of breast surgery patients who are treated on a day-stay basis . Recently , Rafael Blanco introduced the Pecs and Pecs II blocks , a practical alternative to both paravertebral and epidural blockade in the management of pain after breast surgery . The investigators introduced the Pecs II block in their clinical practice . This study compares general anesthesia with a Pecs II block to general anesthesia with a placebo Pecs II block for breast surgery . The objective is to evaluate analgesic effectiveness and changes in opioid consumption when applying a Pecs II block versus a placebo Pecs II block . Stage 1-3 patients having mastectomies or tumourectomies with axillary clearance will be randomly assigned to general anesthesia with a Pecs II block or to general anesthesia with a placebo Pecs II block .

Maastricht University Medical Center,NCT02540551,Sentinel Node Detection in Ovarian Cancer,Maastricht University Medical Center,1,0,Ovarian Neoplasms,Procedure,Injection of radioactive tracer combined with Patent Blue,Diagnostic,,"Recently the investigators have shown that the SN procedure performed through the injection of tracers into the ovarian ligaments is feasible and promising in patients with clinical early stage ovarian cancer ( OC ) . Injection of radioactive tracers resulted in the identification of SNs in all 21 patients . Before a multicentre prospective trial can be initiated , still some questions have to be answered , especially if a SN procedure still is feasable in patients with OC through injection of the tracers in the ovarian ligaments , when the ovarian tumour has already been resected , either during the same surgical procedure ( ovarian tumour resected for frozen section with a malignancy as result ) or at a second surgical procedure to complete the staging procedure ( by laparotomy or laparoscopy ) .","Rationale : As most cancers , ovarian cancer also spreads to regional lymph nodes . The concept of sentinel lymph node surgery is to see whether the cancer has spread to the very first lymph node or sentinel node ( SN ) . If the SN does not contain cancer , then there is a high likelihood that the cancer has not spread to other lymph nodes . This means that , at least theoretically , a radical lymphadenectomy could be omitted and thus the associated morbidity . The SN technique has been proven to be effective in other cancers such as breast cancer and malignant melanoma . In the gynaecological field it has been shown to be effective in vulvar cancer . Recently the investigators have shown that the SN procedure performed through the injection of tracers into the ovarian ligaments is feasible and promising in patients with clinical early stage ovarian cancer ( OC ) . Injection of radioactive tracers resulted in the identification of SNs in all 21 patients . Before a multicentre prospective trial can be initiated , still some questions have to be answered . Objectives : To determine whether or not a SN procedure in patients with OC is feasible through injection of the tracers in the ovarian ligaments , when the ovarian tumour has already been resected during the same surgical procedure ( ovarian tumour resected for frozen section with a malignancy as result ) during a second surgical procedure to complete the staging procedure ( by laparotomy or laparoscopy ) , which becomes actual when a previously resected apparently benign ovarian tumour appears to be malignant at definite pathology . To determine if blue colorization of the sentinel nodes after injection of blue dye is related to the time-interval between injection and retroperitoneal exploration ? To determine if the technique becomes more accurate by using a mobile gamma-camera guidance during the surgical procedure . Study design : phase I feasibility study . Study population : the following patients will be included : Patients with a high suspicion of an ovarian malignancy in whom a median laparotomy and a frozen section analysis is planned . Patients in whom previously an adnexal mass has been removed which appeared to be malignant , in whom a surgical staging procedure is planned . Intervention ( if applicable ) : Injection of blue dye and the radioactive-colloid in the ligamentum ovarium proprium and the ligamentum infundibulo-pelvicum . This will be done on the side of ( suspected ) malignancy . Main study parameter : Percentage of patients in whom it is feasible to identify SN 's in case the malignant ovarian mass has already been resected . Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation , benefit and group relatedness : in case the tracer is injected with the adnexal mass still in situ , the surgery is prolonged at maximum with 20-25 minutes due to the required incubation time after injection of the blue dye and radioactive isotope . A scintigram will be performed 24 hours after the surgery to determine whether residual radioactive lymph nodes can be detected . The scintigram will only be performed if the patient is capable to be transported to the nuclear department . No extra blood samples will be taken , no extra visits , physical examinations or other tests are necessary . There is no risk of tumour dissemination by injecting the tracers in the ovarian ligaments . There is a 0.07 to 2.7 % risk of an allergic reaction to the blue dye .

National Institutes of Health Clinical Center (CC),NCT02556333,Emtricitabine/Tenofovir Alafenamide as Salvage ART,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID),2,0,HIV,Drug,FTC/TAF,Treatment,,"Background : HIV attacks the immune system . Antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) is a combination of drugs used for treating HIV infection . For some people , ART drugs stop working against their HIV . Researchers want to see if a different form of the drug tenofovir ( an ART drug currently approved by the FDA ) , combined with another drug , may help people whose HIV is resistant to ART . This combination pill is called F/TAF Objective : To study the safety and efficacy of the drug F/TAF , when used with other ART , for people whose HIV infection has been hard to control with available medicines . Eligibility : People age 14 years and older who have HIV infection and are enrolled in the DOTCOM ( 14-I-0009 ) protocol . Design : Participants will be screened with physical exam , medical history , and blood and urine tests . Participants will stay in the hospital for at least 10 days . For the first 9 days , they will take F/TAF by mouth along with their usual ART drugs . In the hospital , they will repeat the screening tests . Participants will have a DEXA scan , an x-ray that measures calcium and other minerals in the bones . Participants will lie on a soft table while the scanner passes over the lower spine and hips . Participants will get a supply of F/TAF and some new ART drugs to take at home . Participants will have follow-up visits in 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , and 12 weeks . After the 12-week visit , they will come back about every 3 months for about 1 year . At these visits , participants will repeat the screening tests . They will discuss any problems taking their ART drugs . They may have another DEXA scan .","Despite the success of antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) , a subset of HIV-1-infected patients have uncontrolled viremia , multiple drug class resistance , and limited treatment options . Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( TDF ) forms part of most ART regimens , however its long-term use is associated with renal tubulopathy and reduced bone mineral density . Viral mutations ( eg , K65R , multiple thymidine analog mutations ( TAMs ) can confer resistance or reduced susceptibility to TDF . Tenofovir alafenamide ( TAF ) is an investigational oral prodrug of tenofovir . When compared to TDF , TAF demonstrated lower plasma tenofovir concentrations and more potent antiviral activity at approximately one-tenth of the dose . TAF has the advantage of reduced tenofovir exposure to the renal tubules and bone , potentially resulting in fewer kidney and bone effects . As with TDF , TAF has potent activities against hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) , and may be a treatment option for patients with HIV/HBV co-infections . Phase 2 trials have demonstrated the non-inferiority of TAF to TDF in treating HIV-1 infection in ART-naive patients . Smaller reductions in bone mineral density were measured with TAF than TDF . The most common adverse events were nausea and diarrhea . This single-arm , single-site , open-label trial will explore the safety and efficacy of TAF in a fixed combination with emtricitabine ( FTC ) ( F/TAF , Gilead Sciences Inc. ) as part of a salvage antiretroviral regimen for HIV-1-infected adults and adolescents ( greater than or equal to 14 years ) who experienced virologic failure . The study will recruit patients who have failed TDF-containing regimens or can not take TDF ( due to resistance mutations or risk of renal injury ) and for whom abacavir/lamivudine ( ABC/3TC ) is not an optimal alternative . Eligible patients will begin 9 days of inpatient directly observed therapy ( DOT ) with F/TAF plus their pre-enrollment background regimen . On Day 10 , patients will switch to F/TAF plus OBT while waiting for the results of Day 10 HIV RNA results . Patients with an HIV RNA decline of < 0.5 log10 from Day 1 to Day 10 will discontinue F/TAF , end their study participation , and continue OBT ( with TDF/FTC or ABC/3TC in place of F/TAF , as appropriate ) under the 14-I-0009 protocol . Patients with a greater than or equal to 0.5 log10 decline in HIV RNA will continue on F/TAF + OBT for 48 weeks , with periodic outpatient assessments of adherence , safety , renal function , bone mineral density , HIV RNA , and CD4 T cell counts . Switching of one or more drugs in an ART regimen due to inadequate viral response will require inpatient DOT under 14-I-0009 .",2015-09-18,"October 17, 2017","INCLUSION Age greater than or equal to 14 years Documented HIV-1 infection ( written documentation of positive standard ELISA or rapid HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody test with confirmatory Western Blot , or documentation of repeated HIV RNA of > 1,000 copies/mL ) Concurrent enrollment in the DOTCOM ( 14-I-0009 ) protocol For females of childbearing potential , willingness to use effective contraception for the duration of the study Willingness to be hospitalized for 10-15 days ( with potential for day passes ) Willingness to have blood samples stored for future research that may include genetic testing Multiple ART failure as defined by at least one of the following criteria : HIV RNA > 1000 copies/mL and documented virologic failure on at least 1 prior ART regimen and at least 2 consecutive HIV RNA plasma measurements of > 1,000 copies/mL , including the last documented value , while on the currently prescribed ART regimen for at least 6 months ; or Documented extensive resistance to at least 3 antiretroviral ( ARV ) drug classes , and persistent plasma viremia ( HIV RNA > 1,000 copies/mL for > 6 months ) despite multiple regimen changes .

In 60-70 % of cases it is related to high risk , moderate or mild prothrombotic risk factors . Accordingly , there are 2 types of complications from PVT : ( i ) gastrointestinal haemorrhage related to portal hypertension ; and ( ii ) recurrent thrombosis . Recurrent thrombosis its most dreaded complication as it may lead to intestinal infarction with a related mortality of 20-60 % and a high risk of intestinal insufficiency . Gastrointestinal haemorrhage related to portal hypertension occurs in 20 % patients/year . It is less frequent in patients treated with medical or endoscopic prophylaxis for variceal bleeding . Retrospective data shows that anticoagulation does not worsen the prognosis , and may conversely improve it . Thus , in patients at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding due to portal hypertension and a mild or moderate risk of recurrent thrombosis , the benefit-risk ratio of anticoagulation therapy is unclear . The aim of this open randomised trial is to assess the efficacy of Xarelto 15mg/day , a new oral factor Xa inhibitor , in the recurrence of thromboembolic event and the risk of major bleeding compared to an untreated group in patients with chronic portal vein thrombosis without high risk thrombophilia . The hypothesis of the trial is that treatment with Xarelto® would reduce the risk of recurrence of acute deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) regardless location , with limited increase in the risk of hemorrhage in patients with chronic portal thrombosis and no high-risk factors for thrombosis recurrence This is a national , multicentric , interventional study . 17 french centers already agreed to participate . 296 patients will be included on a 3 years period with 2 to 4 years treatment period .

Safety Evaluation : Assessment of treatment safety based on incidence of any treatment emergent/treatment associated adverse events prior to discharge and at 1 , 3 , 6 and 12 months post treatment . Efficacy evaluation : Clinical evaluations , including EDSS and 29-item Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale ( MSIS-29 ) will be performed at baseline before stem cell mobilization , prior to discharge at 1 , 3 , 6 and 12 months after stem cell therapy . The MS Functional Composite ( MSFC ) consists of the ( a ) Timed 25-Foot Walk , ( b ) 9 Hole Peg Test , and ( c ) Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test will be performed at baseline before stem cell mobilization and at 12 months after stem cell therapy . Gadolinium enhanced MRI scans of the brain will be performed at baseline before therapy and then 12 months after stem cell therapy . Follow-up scans will be performed on the same type of scanner used at baseline . Scans will be analyzed centrally . The 'baseline MRI scan ' will be the reference for brain volume changes . DATA COLLECTION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS : Descriptive analyses of the adverse events will be performed . Proportion of adverse events at each visit will be calculated using frequency distribution . The frequency , severity , timing and the potential relationship to the intervention will be assessed in order to characterize the safety of the intervention . The probability of overall event-free survival ( as well as progression-free , relapse-free , or MRI event-free survival ) at baseline through 1 year will be calculated . The end point of progression is defined as increased Expanded Disability Status Scale ( EDSS ) score greater than 0.5 from baseline . Analyses will be conducted using Kaplan-Meier estimates with Wald-type 90 % CIs based on Greenwood 's formula for SE . Descriptive analyses of all primary and secondary efficacy endpoints will be performed using descriptive statistics . Proportion of patients with clinically significant change in this efficacy measurement scales ( EDSS , MSIS , MSFC , MSFC-25 foot walking test , MSFC-Nine Hole Peg Test , MSFC-Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test ) and change in gadolinium enhancing lesions , new T2 lesions from previous visit will be presented as a proportion . The percentage of change in brain volume will be calculated from screening and analyzed by end point status at month 12 with an exact Wilcoxon rank sum test using mean scores when the results are identical.The null hypothesis tests whether the median percentage of change in brain volume among participants who met the endpoint by month 12 is equal to the median of those who have not met the end point by month 12 . Other primary and secondary efficacy endpoints ( EDSS , MSIS , MSFC , MSFC-25 foot walking test , MSFC-Nine Hole Peg Test , MSFC-Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test ) will be analyzed using a Wilcoxon signed rank test . Change from baseline outcomes for all the endpoints will be calculated for each patient who underwent stem cell transplant as the post transplant value minus the baseline value . The null hypothesis tests whether the median difference from baseline measurement in the values at the month 1 , month 3 , month 6 and month 12 visits was significantly different from zero , with baseline measurement defined as the screening assessment for the percentage of change in brain volume and the baseline visit for all other end points . To calculate MSFC , results from each of the 3 components will be transformed into a z score and averaged to yield a composite for each patient at each timepoint . The z scores that compose the MSFC score will be calculated using the reference population from the National Multiple Sclerosis Society Task Force database .",2015-04-08,"November 3, 2015","Main inclusion criteria : Males and Females between age 18 and 60 years with confirmed diagnosis of Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis made by a neurology expert/MS expert with lesions demonstrated on brain MRI that are consistent with MS and having an EDSS ( Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale ) score between 3.5 & 6 Inclusion Criteria : Males and Females between age 18 and 60 years Diagnosis of Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis made by a neurology expert/MS expert with lesions demonstrated on brain MRI that are consistent with MS Duration of disease : > 5 years Having an EDSS ( Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale ) score between 3.5 & 6 History of 2 or more relapses within last 2 years with increase in EDSS scale of > 0.5 sustained for > 4 weeks Failure to respond or intolerance to the currently available Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) immunomodulatory treatments ) : the lack of response to these treatments will be determined/defined by history of 2 or more relapses within last 2 years with increase in EDSS scale of > 0.5 sustained for > 4 weeks Must have proof of health insurance in country of residence Exclusion Criteria : Primary progressive , secondary progressive or progressive relapsing MS as defined by Lublin and Reingold , 1996 .

The safety of this therapy will also be studied .,"Study Drug Administration : If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study , you will take pacritinib at about the same time each day by mouth , 2 times each day . Your doctor will tell you when to start and stop taking pacritinib . You may be able to take the drug for about 2-6 months depending on how you tolerate the drug and when your transplant date is . If you do not receive your transplant , you may be able to continue taking the study drug as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best interest . You must swallow the capsules whole with a glass ( about 8 ounces ) of water . Do not open , break , or chew the capsules . If you vomit or miss a dose of pacritinib , take your next dose of pacritinib at your regular time . Do not `` make up '' a missed or vomited dose . You will be given a study drug diary to write down what time you take each dose of pacritinib . You need to bring the study drug diary , any leftover study drug , and any empty study drug containers with you to each study visit . The dose of pacritinib you receive may be lowered or stopped , if the doctor thinks it is needed . About 21 days after your last dose of pacritinib , you will given standard of care drugs and you will have an allogeneic stem cell transplant . Your doctor will explain this treatment and the stem cell transplant to you in more detail . You will be required to sign a separate consent form . Study Visits : One ( 1 ) time each month : You will have a physical exam . Blood ( about 2 teaspoons ) will be drawn for routine tests and to check your kidney and liver function . You will have an electrocardiogram ( EKG -- a test that measures the electrical activity of the heart ) . On Day 14 ( +/- 2 days ) of of Cycle 1 , blood ( about 2 teaspoons ) will be drawn for routine tests and to check your kidney and liver function . You can have this blood drawn at a local lab or clinic that is closer to your home . The results will be sent to the study doctor at MD Anderson . During Week 2 of Cycle 1 , a member of the study staff will call to ask you about any symptoms you may be having . This call should last about 5-10 minutes . Length of Study : You will be on study for up to 1 year after the transplant . You may be taken off study early if the disease gets worse , if you have any intolerable side effects , of if you are unable to follow study directions . Your participation on this study will be over after about 1 year of follow-up tests . End-of-Study Visit : Within about 7 days after your last dose of pacritinib , but before your stem cell transplant : You will have a physical exam and an ultrasound , MRI , or CT scan of your abdomen to measure your liver and spleen . You will have an EKG . Before your transplant , you will have a bone marrow biopsy/aspiration to check the status of the disease . Follow-Up Tests : You will have follow-up visits at about 1 , 3 , 6 , and 12 months after the transplant : You will complete 3 questionnaires about your symptoms and quality of life . It should take about 20-30 minutes to complete the questionnaires . At Month 3 , you will have a physical exam and an ultrasound , MRI , or CT scan of your abdomen to measure your liver and spleen . This will be repeated at Month 12 , if your doctor thinks it is needed . At Months 3 and 12 , you will have a bone marrow biopsy/aspiration to check the status of the disease .

Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center,NCT02415556,Memory Aid by Intranasal Insulin in Diabetes (MemAID),Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center,2,1,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,Drug,Regular Human Insulin,Treatment,Quadruple,"The main purpose of this study is to find the long-term effects of daily administration of 40 IU of intranasal insulin ( INI ) as compared to placebo ( sterile saline ) on cognition and memory in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus ( DM ) , and non-diabetic controls over 24 weeks with a follow-up period for 24 weeks . Four groups will be tested : DM group treated with INI ; DM group treated with placebo ; control group treated with INI and the control group treated with placebo . The INI or placebo will be delivered into the nose . The investigators are interested to see whether INI can improve memory and cognition and blood flow in the brain in the type 2 DM group as compared to placebo and to the non-diabetic group over a long-term period .","The investigators propose a randomized controlled trial determining the long-term effects of intranasal insulin ( INI ) on cognition and memory in type 2 diabetes ( DM ) and non-DM groups . The investigators hypothesize that : 1 ) INI-treated adults with DM have better memory and functioning of specific cognitive domains and faster walking during a dual task than those treated with placebo and the control group ; 2 ) Glycemic and insulin resistance and genetic markers for Alzheimer 's disease ( Apolipoprotein E4 [ ApoE4 ] ) may serve as predictors of positive responses to INI therapy ; 3 ) INI treatment neither adversely affects systemic glycemic levels or the cardiovascular system nor causes weight gain . Aim 1 : To determine whether INI-treated type 2 DM adults have a ) better memory and functioning of specific cognitive domains and b ) faster dual-task gait speed and better daily living functioning than the placebo-treated and non-DM groups . Four groups will be tested : 60 DM subjects treated with insulin ; 60 DM subjects treated with placebo ; 45 control subjects treated with INI and 45 control subjects treated with placebo . These 210 patients are expected to complete treatment and 168 are expected to complete study by the study completion anticipated date . The investigators will conduct a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled study in 120 older adults with type 2 DM and 90 non-DM controls examining whether 40 IU INI once daily over a 24-week period improves : Specific domains of visuospatial attention and memory , verbal learning ( primary outcomes ) ; Gait speed during a dual task ( which is an excellent predictor of overall health ) , daily living functionality , and depression as compared to the DM group receiving sterile saline and the non-DM groups . The non-DM groups will provide reference of INI effects in a clinical phenotype of cognitive decline and insulin resistance that occurs with normal aging . Aim 2 : To identify a phenotype and long-term trajectory predicting clinically relevant response to INI therapy based on glycemic control , insulin resistance , endothelial and genetic markers . The investigators will determine a phenotype predicting a clinically relevant response to INI therapy and identify time-dependent trajectories of INI effects on cognition in the DM group vs. the placebo and the non-DM groups . Clinical predictors will be based on associations between cognitive function and/or gait and demographic , glycemic control , insulin resistance , endothelial and genetic ( ApoE4 ) measures . The investigators will evaluate the dose-escalating trajectory of cognition , gait speed , and functionality during the 24 weeks of therapy and 24 weeks post-treatment and their dependence on the above-mentioned factors , and determine the time point when maximum effect was reached . INI therapy response is defined as a clinically relevant improvement on cognitive tests or in gait speed ( as a continuous variable ) or as responders vs. non-responders as compared to placebo within DM and non-DM groups ( as a categorical variable ) . MRI substudy : The investigators will explore the long-term INI effects on regional perfusion , vasodilatation , and resting functional connectivity in 40 DM subjects pre- and post- INI/placebo administration at the beginning and at the end of intervention and their relationships to cognitive outcomes . Regional perfusion and vasodilatation will be measured by pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling ( PCASL ) MRI at 3 Tesla , and resting-state functional connectivity will be quantified from low-frequency ( 0.01-0.08 Hz ) fluctuations ( LFF ) of the whole-brain blood-oxygen-level dependent ( BOLD ) functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( fMRI ) . Aim 3 : To determine the long-term safety of INI vs. placebo with regard to glycemic control ( fasting glucose , hemoglobin A1c [ HbA1c ] , hypoglycemic episodes ) , vital signs , and body mass . The investigators will obtain measurements of fasting glucose , insulin , vital signs , and body mass at baseline , 2-months , 4-months , and 6-months follow-up and keep weekly logs monitoring glucose and adverse events . Safety substudy : In the first 20 DM patients treated with subcutaneous insulin , the investigators will conduct continuous glucose monitoring ( CGM ) OR 5 finger sticks/day ( effective after 9/25/2017 ) for 1 week during baseline and during the first week of INI or placebo treatment to evaluate the INI effects on glycemic control , hypoglycemic episodes , and body weight .

They will have another echocardiogram . At the end of therapy , participants will have a physical exam and blood tests . They will be asked about how they feel and any medicines they are taking .","Background : Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 ( STAT ) 3 is considered to be a promising cancer drug target because of its pleiotropic involvement in tumorigenesis . STAT3 not only regulates the expression of many genes which are directly important for the survival of tumor cells , but it is also an important factor in non-tumor cells in the tumor microenvironment involved in immune evasion of tumor cells , angiogenesis , and metastasis . AZD9150 is an antisense oligonucleotide designed to target and down-regulate expression of human STAT3 mRNA . By focusing on patients with malignant ascites it will be more feasible for us to sample the tumor environment and to do it more frequently than , for example , conventional tumor tissue biopsies . Malignant ascites is a relatively common occurrence in ovarian and gastrointestinal malignancies , impacting greatly on quality of life .

University of Johannesburg,NCT02419209,The Effect of Individualised Homeopathic Treatment on Low Sexual Desire in Perimenopause,University of Johannesburg,2,1,Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder,Other,Sucrose pillules medicated with the Individualised Homeopathic Remedy,Treatment,,"Low sexual desire , or decreased libido , is one of the most prevalent sexual complaints in females . Menopause is defined as the physiologic cessation of menses brought on by a decrease in ovarian function and is established once menses have been absent for at least twelve months . Perimenopause refers to the period shortly before as well as the twelve months after the last menstrual period . The duration of perimenopause varies greatly and signs and symptoms usually begin appearing during a woman 's forties . A longitudinal study conducted in Seattle showed that women experienced a significant reduction in sexual desire during the late perimenopausal and early postmenopausal stages , with the biggest decline in sexual desire occurring from three years prior to two years after the final menstrual period . Despite being a prevalent female complaint , currently no standard treatment for low sexual desire exists . Homeopathy may offer a safe and effective solution for this common problem , however limited research has been conducted to date . The aim of this study is to explore the effect of individualised homeopathic treatment on low sexual desire in perimenopausal females using detailed case studies , the desire and arousal subscales of the Female Sexual Function Index ( FSFI ) as well as Item 13 of the Female Sexual Distress Scale - Revised ( FSDS-R ) .","This study is an embedded mixed method case study design and will take place at the University of Johannesburg Homeopathic Health Centre , Doornfontein Campus , over a period of twelve weeks . These twelve weeks will consist of four consultations per participant at four week intervals . Ten female participants aged 40-60 years who meet the inclusion criteria will be recruited by means of advertisements placed at the University of Johannesburg Doornfontein Campus as well as at pharmacies and health shops in the Gauteng area ( with relevant permission given ) . Once the volunteers agree to participate in the study , they will be requested to sign a Participant Information and Consent Form at the start of the initial consultation . Participants will also be requested to complete a screening questionnaire in order to determine whether they meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria . A complete case history will be taken for each participant who fits the inclusion criteria , using a detailed homeopathic case-taking form ; vital signs will be checked and any necessary physical examinations will be performed . Participants will also complete the relevant Female Sexual Function Index ( FSFI ) subscales and Item 13 of the Female Sexual Distress Scale- Revised ( FSDS-R ) . The appropriate individualised homeopathic remedy for each participant will be selected using Mercurius Repertorisation Software Complete Repertory 2014 and the appropriate homeopathic Materia Medicas , under supervision of the attending clinician . At the follow-up consultations the case will be re-taken and the homeopathic medicine will either be repeated or changed based on the response of the participant to the medication previously administered following the principles of homeopathic prescribing . A relevant physical exam will be conducted , and participants will complete the relevant subscales of the FSFI and item 13 of the FSDS-R at each of the four consultations . All data will be collected by the researcher during the course of the study . Qualitative data obtained from detailed case-takings will be used to write descriptive case studies . The FSFI subscales and FSDS-R Item 13 will be used to assess changes in desire and arousal across time and will be represented graphically . Due to the small sample size and qualitative nature of the cases no statistical analysis will be completed . The outcome of this study may possibly indicate the effectiveness of individualised homeopathic treatment in low sexual desire associated with perimenopause .

The disease is life threatening and may be acute or chronic and the first choice treatment for patients with acute GvHD ( Grade II or higher ) is the immunosuppressive corticosteroid hormone methylprednisolone . However , some GvHD patients may be resistant to this treatment leading to disease progression and a high rate of morbidity and mortality , primarily from infections and/or multi-organ failure . There are currently no other satisfactory therapies . BEGEDINA® is a therapeutic monoclonal antibody that recognises and binds to CD26 on CD4+ T lymphocytes . BEGEDINA® reduces the activity of CD26 in these cells and inhibits the immune response leading to improvement in patients that have shown steroid resistance . This study is therefore aimed at demonstrating that BEGEDINA® is a safe and effective treatment for steroid-resistant GvHD patients where no other such treatments are currently available .","This is a prospective , phase II/III , randomized clinical study to compare the efficacy and safety of BEGEDINA® ( Begelomab ) versus `` conventional treatment '' for treating steroid-resistant acute graft versus host disease ( GvHD ) . Despite prophylactic treatment , GvHD still develops in up to 30 % of allogeneic hemopoietic stem cell transplant ( HSCT ) recipients . GvHD is a life-threatening and complex immunological disease that may be acute or chronic . Acute GvHD affects mainly the skin , liver and gastrointestinal ( GI ) tissues with long-term survival directly related to the severity of skin , liver and gut involvement . First line treatment for patients with acute GvHD ( Grade II or higher ) is the immunosuppressive corticosteroid methylprednisolone . Although effective in over 50 % of patients , durable responses are observed in only a third of patients and it also confers a risk of severe infection . Steroid-resistant acute GvHD is associated with a high rate of morbidity and mortality , primarily from infections and/or multi-organ failure . Despite this , there are no authorized treatments for non-responders and GvHD remains largely an untreatable disease with limited survival and thus a great unmet therapeutic need . BEGEDINA® ( Begelomab ) is a murine immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) 2b monoclonal antibody against CD26 ( dipeptidyl peptidase-4 ; DPP4 ) and is produced by biotechnological means and is a new potential therapeutic approach . BEGEDINA® has been shown to bind to CD26 which is present on a subset of CD4+ T helper lymphocytes leading to down-regulation of CD26 signaling and inhibition of immune response and thus therapeutic improvements . BEGEDINA has been investigated in two completed clinical studies : a pilot study and a dose-finding study and so far showing promising efficacy , safety and tolerability . The primary objective for this study is therefore to determine the efficacy of BEGEDINA® versus conventional therapy in steroid-resistant acute GvHD . To satisfy this objective , two co primary hypothesis will be tested . The first is that the overall response rate consisting of the Complete Responders and the Partial Responders ( CR+PR ) at Study Day 28 will be higher in the BEGEDINA® treated subjects . The second is that the incidence of transplant-related mortality ( TRM ) at 6 months will be reduced in those subjects treated with BEGEDINA® versus those treated with conventional therapy . Additional secondary efficacy endpoints will also be assessed as a measure of effectiveness . In addition , some pharmacokinetics assessments will be performed . Adverse events ( AEs ) will be coded using MedDRA and the frequency , causality and intensity of AEs will be compared to conventional therapies . Further safety analysis will also include laboratory findings , vital signs , immunogenicity and other assessments . Finally , some exploratory analysis will also be performed . This will be a prospective , multicenter , randomized , open-label , phase II/III clinical study in which subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive BEGEDINA® treatment or the best conventional treatment available in their territory as no second line therapy is currently approved . It is planned to enroll 184 male or female adult subjects with an upper age limit of 65 years with steroid-resistant acute GvHD . BEGEDINA® will be administered at a dose of 2.7 mg/m2/day for 5 consecutive days from Study Day 1 through to Study Day 5 , and on Study Days 10 , 14 , 17 , 21 , 24 , and 28 . Thus , the expected duration for each subject will be approximately 12 months . The final statistical analysis plan ( SAP ) will be finalized prior to database lock . Baseline characteristics of the subject sample will be described using summary statistics . All statistical tests will be conducted at a 2-sided significance level of 5 % unless specifically specified . Multiple Imputation methods will be used as the primary method for accounting for missing data .",2015-03-24,"January 20, 2020","Inclusion Criteria : Age ≥18 and ≤65 years of age .

Medical College of Wisconsin,NCT02412475,Epigenetic Reprogramming in Relapse AML,Michael Burke,1,0,"Leukemia, Acute Myeloid",Drug,Decitabine,Treatment,,"Successful treatment for children and young adults with relapsed acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) continues to be a significant challenge . Despite relative improvements in survival for patients with newly diagnosed AML , an estimated 40-60 % will relapse with the majority eventually dying of their relapsed disease . Attaining a subsequent remission in patients who relapse is the initial critical step toward achieving a potential cure . As chemotherapy resistance is one of the primary drivers of poor treatment response and subsequent relapse in AML , identifying methods to reverse this resistance are desperately needed . This clinical trial is aimed at improving the remission re-Induction rates for children and adults with relapsed or refractory AML through epigenetic modifying agents that have the ability to reverse chemotherapy resistance . Decitabine , a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor ( DNMTi ) and Vorinostat , a histone deacetylase inhibitor ( HDACi ) , are two epigenetic modifying drugs that act on the methylation of proximal promoter regions of genes and on proteins involved in the wrapping of DNA around histones , respectively . Both processes play a critical role in regulating gene expression , and frequently these genes are involved in chemotherapy resistance . These agents are FDA-approved for treatment in adult hematologic malignancies , making this an opportune time to begin testing these novel therapies in pediatric leukemia trials . This study will investigate chemotherapy priming of relapsed/refractory AML using Decitabine and Vorinostat given for 5 days prior to standard re-Induction with Fludarabine , Cytarabine and G-CSF for children and adults .","Phase 1 Study Number of Patients : 12 to 24 evaluable subjects will be required to enroll subjects in all 4 dose levels .

Medical University of South Carolina,NCT02941692,Oxytocin for Couples Conflict Resolution,Medical University of South Carolina,2,1,Substance Misuse,Drug,Oxytocin,Other,Double,"Oxytocin is a promising new medication found to have positive effects on prosocial behavior , reduce negative affect such as fear and anxiety , and reduce stress-induced addictive behaviors . This study aims to investigate the extent to which a 40 IU dose of intranasal oxytocin improves couples ' conflict resolution skills and subjective , physiological , and neuroendocrine responses to conflict . Conflict resolution discussions will take place in the laboratory and will be videotaped .","Substance use disorders ( SUD ) are characterized by dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis ( HPA ) . The neuropeptide oxytocin , commonly administered as an intranasal spray , is a drug that has prominent anxiolytic and prosocial effects on human behaviors . While the mechanisms of action facilitating the behavioral effects of oxytocin in humans is complex and many questions about this process remain , there is a consensus in the existing literature that oxytocin modulates HPA axis reactivity to stressful social stimuli . Preliminary studies suggest that oxytocin is known to reduce couple conflict among normative couples . A more developed line of research indicates that oxytocin mitigates addictive behaviors in the context of various drugs of abuse . Given the high prevalence and severity of dyadic conflict among couples where one or both partner has substance abuse , and given the salience of dyadic conflict as a precipitant to substance use behaviors , it is critical to investigate the therapeutic effects of oxytocin among couples with substance use problems . Namely , oxytocin holds promise as a potential augmenter for conjoint couples therapies , particularly those targeting the reduction of substance use problems . However , only two studies have examined the effects of oxytocin on couples ' communication behaviors . Those two studies found that couples ' communication skills improved following the administration of oxytocin .

The idea stems from an earlier study conducted in Dr. Benet 's lab with the drug furosemide . The furosemide study yielded triplicate data that were unable to purely meet the BE statistical criteria set forth by the FDA due to the inherent study design . Furosemide is not an NTID to be considered by the FDA for BE studies , however . Hence , the investigators have proposed a new study to assess the BE statistical criteria with warfarin , an NTID with a draft guidance issued by the FDA . By providing the reference product ( brand name warfarin ) three times to each study participant and recording the relevant pharmacokinetic parameters for BE ( AUC and Cmax ) , the investigators can make three comparisons between the data ( R1 and R2 vs. R2 and R3 ; R1 and R2 vs. R1 and R¬3 ; R2 and R3 vs. R1 and R3 ) . The investigators have three concerns that can be tested here . Will normal within subject variability potentially lead to inequivalence of the reference product using the new NTID BE regulations ? Is it possible that the BE interval could be less than the United States Pharmacopeia ( USP ) content uniformity limits for warfarin ?

They will score in a blind manner the taste of 10 drugs commonly prescribed in nursing homes , crushed in jelly or apple compote . These volunteers will be 8 food professionals and 8 geriatric care professionals . Thanks to the MELA protocol , they will have a unique opportunity to communicate and propose solutions to this neglected aspect of malnutrition in elderly populations .","Background . Elderly people often suffer from chronic pathologies and they are given polypharmacy . In nursing homes , the residents take an average number of 6 to 8 active principles / day ( Reference Geriatrics ward , Nice University Hospital , France ) , the equivalent of 10 to 20 medicines / day . But 40 % of the residents have swallowing disorders or cognitive impairment : the nursing staff is obliged to crush tablets and capsules and to give them mixed in a compote , a dairy or a jelly , for instance . Some experts groups ( OMEDIT ) have published a list of drugs authorized to be crushed , because this practice can modify the pharmacokinetics of certain active principles , and render them inactive or even toxic . However , the gustative aspect of crushed drugs has never been investigated . Main objective . To identify from the advice of healthy volunteers , on the gustative aspect , which medicine it is acceptable or not recommended to add once crushed or opened in food . Secondary objective . To search for alternative solutions . Type of study . Phase I study on healthy volunteers . It is a cohort study , with a hedonic , descriptive test in a single group and a single one session , to test the taste of 10 drugs crushed in some jelly and apple compote . Volunteers participating in the study will be 16 healthy volunteers : 8 professionals of the restaurant , the catering , the food aromas , the nutrition and the dietetics , and 8 doctors , pharmacists , dental surgeons , nurses and/or nurse 's aides . Inclusion criteria : healthy volunteers over 18 years , without allergy known about 10 drugs to be tested . Pregnant women will not be included . Criteria of evaluation : Quantitative : mark from 0 ( bad taste ) to 10 ( no taste or no unpleasant taste ) for the jelly and compote specimens mixed with crushed drugs . Qualitative : description of the perceived aroma ( acid , bitter , sweet , salty , astringent , pricking , aromatic ) . Brief description of the methodology : The investigator shall test 10 drugs the most prescribed in the Korian group nursing homes , identified as being able to be crushed or opened . The assay will take place during a single one-morning session in a room specifically dedicated to clinical assays and with the help of a nursing staff trained for clinical assays ( Nice University Hospital ) . Medicine will be crushed in parallel in some jelly and apple compote : 10 single drugs , 1 mixture of 6 drugs and 1 comparator ( unmodified plain jelly and compote ) . Every volunteer will make these 24 tests blind and will fill a scoring sheet . He or she will spit out and have an oral rinse with some water between two tests ; the dose susceptible to be ingested will be about 1/500th of a unit dosage .

RWTH Aachen University,NCT02435095,Antipsychotic Induced Structural and Functional Brain Changes,RWTH Aachen University,4,0,Schizophrenia,Drug,Maintenance treatment,Treatment,Single,"Continuation of antipsychotic drug treatment for at least 12 months after remission of the first psychotic episode represents the gold clinical standard , and it is recommended by all international treatment guidelines . Numerous studies have shown that the risk of relapse is significantly increased , if drug treatment is terminated prematurely . However , only a minority of patients achieve functional remission , even if they fully comply with treatment . Long-term adverse effects of the currently available drugs , specifically brain grey matter loss and development of supersensitivity psychosis , might outweigh their benefits . Thus , the current standard of long-term maintenance antipsychotic treatment , which has the primary goal of relapse prevention , has to be questioned . Here the investigators hypothesize that intermittent treatment ( experimental ) with antipsychotics , which is directed exclusively against the positive symptoms of Schizophrenia , is associated with less loss in total grey matter volume than maintenance treatment ( control ) . Furthermore , the investigators hypothesise that this targeted treatment approach is associated with better functional outcome ( fewer negative symptoms , better cognitive performance , better quality of life ) than continuous antipsychotic treatment , although the latter is initially associated with fewer relapses.The aim of the present study is to compare two different drug therapies -maintenance therapy versus on-demand , intermittent therapy- in terms of their treatment 's success and the structural changes in the brain .","Patients with diagnosis of schizophrenia according to DSM-5 admitted to a hospital participating in the consortium will undergo magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) as soon as possible after admission . Ideally , this procedure is performed before initiation of antipsychotic treatment ( benzodiazepines are allowed ) . If not possible for clinical reasons , antipsychotic treatment will be started and the MRI will be acquired within three days of initiation of drug treatment . The choice of the antipsychotic will be made by the treating physician . All approved antipsychotics are permitted , including first-generation antipsychotics such as haloperidol or flupenthixol . This is based on the recommendation of the British NICE guidelines : `` In nine randomized controlled trials ( RCTs ) with a total of 1,801 participants with first-episode or early schizophrenia ( including people with a recent onset of schizophrenia and people who have never been treated with antipsychotic medication ) , the evidence suggested there were no clinically significant differences in efficacy between the antipsychotic drugs examined . '' ( NICE 2009 , p. 105 ) . However , since second-generation antipsychotics ( SGA ) are now considered first-line treatment for schizophrenia according to the German S3 guideline , it can be assumed that more than 80 % of all patients will be treated with an SGA . As soon as positive symptoms are sufficiently controlled , medication will be completely tapered off within four weeks . Sufficient control of positive symptoms will defined as follows : `` delusions '' ( Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale ( PANSS ) item 1 ) , `` hallucinatory behaviour '' ( PANSS item 3 ) , and `` suspiciousness/persecution '' ( PANSS item 6 ) have to be `` absent '' or `` mild '' ( scores 1 or 2 ) . The PANSS Positive score ( 7 items ) must not be above 18 . Patients in the experimental group who will not reach remission according to this definition will be switched to another antipsychotic according to clinical standards . Tapering of medication might be considered at a later time-point . Patients who can not be tapered off medication will be treated with the lowest possible dose . Treatment of subsequent exacerbations / psychotic relapses will follow the same rules .",2015-04-14,"November 23, 2020","Inclusion Criteria : Patients with diagnosis of schizophrenia according to DSM-5 Age 18-65 years Written declaration of consent Subjects being contractually and mentally capable to attend the medical staffs ' orders .

Multiple examples demonstrate that multi-agent treatments are routine clinical practice in other fields of medicine including chemotherapeutics for cancer , multi-therapeutics for myocardial infarction and broad spectrum antibiotics for pneumonia . At this time , it is unclear if a combination of tocolytic medications for preterm labor is more advantageous for women . If pregnancy is prolonged with combined tocolytic therapy , this could directly influence the treatment of preterm labor and potentially improve neonatal outcomes . There currently are no trials of combination regimens using widely used tocolytic agents , such as nifedipine and indomethacin .

Indiana University,NCT02436265,Low Dose IV Dexamethasone in Prolonging Caudal Anesthesia in Children Undergoing Genitourinary Surgery,Indiana University,4,0,Surgery,Drug,Dexamethasone,Treatment,Single,"Caudal injection of local anesthetic is a neuraxial technique routinely performed on young children for postoperative analgesia after lower abdominal and lower extremity surgical procedures . One of the major limitations of the use of single shot neuraxial injections for this purpose is the limited duration of action of the injected local anesthetic . Adjuvant medications , such as clonidine and epinephrine , have been added to the local anesthetic to prolong the duration of the neuraxial block , with varying results . Dexamethasone is a synthetic glucocorticoid steroid commonly used in the perioperative setting for a multitude of indications , including the prolongation of local anesthetic based analgesia . It has been shown that the administration of dexamethasone either intravenously or via perineural injection can significantly increase the duration of analgesia derived from a local anesthesia based peripheral nerve block . Literature also suggests that the effect of dexamethasone is equivalent whether given intravenously or perineurally . Interest in dexamethasone enhanced caudal analgesia exists and a previous study noted that caudal anesthesia can be prolonged by intravenous dexamethasone . The study was criticized for using a higher dose of dexamethasone ( 0.5 mg/kg ) than is routinely used in the pediatric population outside of airway procedures , which may expose patients to dose related side effects of dexamethasone . A large meta-analysis has suggested that 0.1 mg/kg is effective for analgesic prolongation , but no direct study of low dose intravenous dexamethasone in combination with caudal anesthesia has been performed .","As dexamethasone is an inexpensive and commonly used medication , it would be beneficial to know if a similar prolongation of analgesia occurs when a local anesthetic is given neuraxially in combination with low dose intravenous dexamethasone . This project will investigate the efficacy of low dose intravenous ( IV ) dexamethasone in prolonging the duration of post operative analgesia provided by an intraoperative caudal injection of local anesthetic . All patients will be enrolled in the study the day of surgery , in the preoperative waiting area . The study will be explained by an anesthesiologist with extensive knowledge of the protocol .

In the current protocols , which are more than 90 % effective , each child who is receiving a fecal transplant has to provide their own donor stool , usually from a parent or close relative . This requires considerable screening costs for each case and is logistically complicated as the donor must be present and must stool just prior to the transplant . The investigators hope to show that a small number of healthy donors can provide stool samples which can be frozen and banked and then thawed for use in numerous patients . The primary goal is to show that Clostridium difficile will be eradicated as effectively ( Greater than 90 % success ) when using the stool from the frozen donors . The study will also evaluate the inflammatory response and intestinal microbiome in young children aged 1-3 years with Clostridium difficile infections to better predict which ones will respond to fecal transplantation and which ones have incidental infections . For this question the investigators will gather stool samples to check for lactoferrin , calprotectin , and alpha1antitrypsin , and 16s ribosomal RNA analysis in children before and after the fecal transplants . The goal is to see if there is an intestinal microbiome that predisposes some children to getting sick from Clostridium difficile versus just having it incidentally .","The study is designed to enroll forty children aged 1-18 with recurrent Clostridium difficile Infection ( CDI ) . Recurrent CDI is defined as an infection that persists after three rounds of appropriate antibiotics .

We will recruit chronic HCV patients and healthy control patients for HBV vaccination . We will use RNA Sequencing ( RNA-Seq ) , a relatively new technology for simultaneously measuring the expression of all genes , to determine patients ' innate immune status , and learn how this innate immune signature is related to HBV vaccine response . We will then explore the mechanisms by which chronic HCV infection affects different immune cells and functions that are known to be important for an effective HBV vaccine response . These studies will enhance our understanding of the immune effects of chronic viral infection , establish factors that determine effective vaccine responses , and help guide vaccination strategies for HCV patients and other individuals with chronic inflammatory disease .","Vaccines have been responsible for preventing millions of deaths and extending the average human lifespan . Effective vaccines stimulate the cells of the immune system to activate genes and associated functions that bring about protective immunity . If we can better understand the factors that influence vaccine success versus failure , we may be able to improve current vaccines and/or develop new vaccines against prevalent infectious diseases . Certain groups of people do not respond well to particular vaccines . For example , vaccines can be less effective in immunocompromised patients , elderly individuals , and people with chronic inflammatory diseases . Often it is these groups of people that have the greatest need for protection against infectious disease . People chronically infected with hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) are at increased risk of serious liver disease . As a result , they should receive the hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) vaccine , which can protect them from infection by HBV , another virus that targets the liver . However , people chronically infected with HCV do not respond to the HBV vaccine as effectively as healthy people without HCV . Chronic HCV infection is not thought to cause general problems with the immune system , and the reasons for this poor vaccine response are poorly understood . Previous work has shown that chronic HCV infection leads to production of chemical ( `` innate immune '' ) signals that can affect function of the immune system , but it is currently unknown how this might impact vaccination .",2015-04-24,"February 20, 2020","Inclusion Criteria : Willing to receive three doses of an FDA-approved Hepatitis B vaccine Volunteer chronically infected with HCV ( as demonstrated by serology and/or viral load laboratory studies ) Healthy volunteer without significant medical problems Exclusion Criteria : Received any vaccine within a month prior to study vaccine Positive serum antibody against Hep B surface antigen and/or core Hep B core antigen HIV positive For HCV-negative , healthy volunteers : History of HCV infection or positive HCV antibody test Participation in another clinical study of an investigational product currently or within the past 90 days , or expected participation during this study In the opinion of the investigator , the volunteer is unlikely to comply with the study protocol Any clinically significant abnormality or medical history or physical examination including history of immunodeficiency or autoimmune disease ( in addition to HCV infection , for HCV group ) Currently taking systemic steroids or other immunomodulatory medications including anticancer medications and antiviral medications Any clinically significant acute or chronic medical condition requiring care by a primary care provider ( e.g. , diabetes , coronary artery disease , rheumatologic illness , malignancy , substance abuse ) that , in the opinion of the investigator , would preclude participation Unable to continue participation for 156 weeks History of previous Hepatitis B vaccination ( s ) Male or female 62 years of age Is pregnant or lactating History of Hepatitis B infection Clinical , laboratory , or biopsy evidence of cirrhosis",24,0,18 Years,62 Years

T-cells are white blood cells that are important to the immune system . The T cells for this study ( called regulatory T-cells , or Tregs ) will be from a donor who is not related to you . Before the Tregs are given to you , they may be changed in the laboratory to make use of sugar that is found in small amounts in blood cells through a process called fucosylation . They are then called fucosylated Tregs . Adding more sugars to the Tregs in the laboratory is designed to help the Tregs find their way faster to the bone marrow , which may help low blood counts to recover faster . The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if it is safe and practical to give fucosylated Tregs to patients who will receive a matched related donor ( MRD ) , a matched unrelated donor ( MUD ) , or cord blood transplant . Researchers also want to learn if these Tregs may prevent or reduce the effects of graft-versus host disease ( GVHD ) . GVHD can result from a reaction of the transplanted cord blood cells against certain tissues in the body . This is an investigational study . Fucosylation of Tregs is not an FDA-approved process . It is currently being used for research purposes only . Fludarabine , melphalan , cyclophosphamide and rituximab are FDA approved and commercially available to be given to patients with leukemia or lymphoma having a cord blood transplant . Total body irradiation is delivered using FDA-approved and commercially available methods . Up to 47 patients will take part in this study . All will be enrolled at MD Anderson .","Central Venous Catheter Placement : You will first have a central venous catheter ( CVC ) placed . A CVC is a sterile flexible tube that will be placed into a large vein while you are under local anesthesia . Your doctor will explain this procedure to you in more detail , and you will be required to sign a separate consent form for it . The chemotherapy , some of the other drugs in this study , the Tregs , and the MRD , MUD or cord blood transplant will be given by vein through your CVC . Some blood samples will also be drawn through your CVC . The CVC will remain in your body for about 2-5 months . Study Treatments : If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study , you will be assigned to a dose level of Tregs based on when you joined this study . You may receive fucosylated or non-fucosylated Treg cells . Two dose levels of fucosylated Tregs will be tested . Up to 3 participants will be enrolled in Dose Level 1 , and up to 17 will be in Dose Level 2 . The first group of participants will receive the lower dose level . The next group will receive a higher dose than the first group , if no intolerable side effects were seen . The next 10 participants will receive non-fucosylated Tregs at Dose Level 2 . The last 34 patients enrolled in the study will be will be randomly assigned ( as in the flip of a coin ) to 1 of 2 study groups and will have an equal chance of receiving either fucosylated or non-fucosylated Treg cells . You will receive 1 of 2 preparative regimens before your transplant . These regimens are used to prepare your body to receive the transplant . Your study doctor will decide which regimen is best for you . Regimen # 1 : On Day -12 , you will receive rituximab by vein over 4-6 hours , if you are receiving it . This will depend on the disease that you have . On Day -9 , you will be admitted to the hospital and given fluids by vein to hydrate you . On Day -8 , you will receive fludarabine and cyclophosphamide by vein over 1 hour . You will also receive mesna by vein over 30-60 minutes before the cyclophosphamide dose and then every 4 hours for a total of 5 doses . Mesna is given to lower the risk of side effects to the bladder caused by cyclophosphamide . On Days -7 , -6 , and -5 , you will receive fludarabine by vein over 1 hour . On Day -4 , you will receive a single treatment of low-dose total body irradiation as part of the standard of care for stem cell transplants . You will receive a separate consent form that describes this procedure and its risks . On Day -1 , you will receive the Tregs by vein over 30-60 minutes . On Day 0 , you will receive your stem cell transplant through the CVC over about 30 minutes to several hours depending on the donor type of stem cell transplant you receive . Regimen # 2 : On Day -12 , you will receive rituximab by vein over 4-6 hours , if you are receiving it . This will depend on the disease that you have . On Day -6 , you will be admitted to the hospital and given fluids by vein to hydrate you . On Days -5 , -4 , -3 and -2 , you will receive fludarabine by vein over 1 hour . On Day -2 , you will receive melphalan by vein over 30 mins . On Day -1 , you will receive the Tregs by vein over 30-60 minutes . On Day 0 , you will receive your stem cell transplant through the CVC over about 30 minutes to several hours depending on the donor type of stem cell transplant you receive . Supportive Drugs : You will be given standard drugs to help decrease the risk of side effects . You may ask the study staff about how the drugs are given and their risks . Starting on Day -3 , you will receive sirolimus by mouth once a day . You will receive mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) as a tablet by mouth 3 times a day . If you are not able to take the MMF tablet by mouth , you will receive MMF by vein over 2 hours . If you do not have GVHD at Day 100 , the dose of MMF will be gradually lowered . If you have GVHD , MMF may be stopped 7 days after the GVHD is controlled . If you do not have GVHD at Day 180 after your transplant , the dose of sirolimus will be gradually lowered . Your doctor will discuss this with you . You will receive filgrastim as an injection under the skin 1 time a day , starting on Day 0 for cord blood transplant or Day 7 for a matched related or MUD transplant , until your blood cell levels return to normal . Filgrastim is designed to help with the growth of white blood cells . Study Visits : As part of standard care , you will remain in the hospital for about 4 weeks after the transplant . After you are released from the hospital , you will continue as an outpatient in the Houston area to be monitored for infections and transplant-related complications . On Days -10 , -1 , 0 , +1 , +3 , +7 , +14 , +21 , and then at 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 , and 12 months after the transplant , blood ( about 3 tablespoons ) will be drawn to check your immune function , response to the T cells , inflammatory responses , and for GVHD markers . If possible , the blood will be collected during standard of care blood draws so that no additional needle sticks will be needed . About 1 , 3 , 6 , and 12 months after the transplant : You will have a physical exam . You will be checked for possible reactions to the transplant and study drugs , including GVHD . Blood ( about 4 teaspoons ) will be drawn for routine tests , to check for cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) , and for genetic tests to learn if your body has accepted the donor cells . Urine will be collected for routine tests . If the doctor thinks it is needed , you will have a bone marrow aspiration to check the status of the disease . To collect a bone marrow aspiration/biopsy , an area of the hip or other site is numbed with anesthetic , and a small amount of bone marrow and bone is withdrawn through a large needle . If you have lymphoma or Hodgkin 's Disease and the doctor thinks it is needed , you will have a CT scan of your neck , chest , abdomen , and pelvis to check the status of the disease . Length of Study : You will be on study for up to 1 year . You will be taken off study early if the disease gets worse , if intolerable side effects occur , if not enough T cells can be created , if you are unable to follow study directions , or if your doctor thinks it is in your best interest .",2015-04-15,"January 6, 2021","Inclusion Criteria : Patients with high risk hematologic malignancies , including those with induction failure and in relapse .

Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai,NCT02428920,Grenada Heart Project - Community Health Action to Encourage Healthy Behaviors,Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai,3,1,Health Behavior,Behavioral,Peer Groups,Prevention,,"The Grenada Heart Project ( GHP ) conducted an observational study within a randomly selected adult sample of Grenadians in 2008-2009 . The aim of the study was to assess the clinical , biological and psychosocial determinants of the cardiovascular health in Grenada , in order to develop and implement a nationwide cardiovascular health promotion program . The sample of 2,827 adults was randomly selected from the national electronic voter list . The main outcome measures were self-reported cardiovascular disease and behavioral risk factors , anthropometric measures , blood pressure ( BP ) , point-of-care testing for glucose and lipids , and ankle-brachial index . Analysis of the data revealed prevalence rates of obesity , hypertension and diabetes significantly exceeding those seen in the U.S . Since the completion of this assessment , an additional effort has contributed significantly to the current project . A parallel community health-promotion project was carried out in Cardona , Spain called the `` Cardona Integral Fifty-Fifty '' project with 80 subjects . The preliminary results of the Cardona study have a shown that peer motivation may significantly improve healthy behaviors and thus modify cardiovascular risk . The GHP CHANGE community -based intervention aims to promote positive behaviors and focus more on what creates health , rather than what prevents sickness . It is built on the foundations of social support , assessing whether people going through similar challenges will support each other , work together to identify and address barriers to success , and motivate each other to move forward . In this program we test for the impact of promotion of healthy lifestyle behaviors through peer motivation on blood pressure , physical activity , eating behavior , weight , and smoking .","This culturally-tailored intervention program will take place over a 12-month period in the following four regions on the island : St. David 's Parish St. Andrew 's Parish St. George 's Parish St. John's/St . Mark 's Parish ( combined ) •The program will involve approximately 400 randomized participants ( 100 from each region ) . Participants , aged 18-70 , from each parish will be divided into one of two groups : Intervention Group arm ( peer support ) or Control Group arm ( individual study ) . The investigators will identify study participants previously enrolled in the Grenada Heart Project , with at least one vascular risk factor , as defined by the Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines which include : elevated BP , increased blood glucose level , increased waist circumference , minimal reported physical activity , minimally reported fruit and vegetable intake , or current smoking habits . Given a 10 % refusal rate and 10 % failure rate in the run-in phase , 120 participants from each site will be invited randomly , from the high risk group , to recruit for participation in the study . All eligible participants are invited to attend an informational half-day session , during which a general overview of the program is presented and participants have an opportunity to have any questions answered . During this session , eligible and interested individuals complete the written consent forms . Upon consenting , participants are informed of their randomization arm ( education intervention or group intervention ) and entered into a run-in phase . All participants receive a notebook , as well as certain health literate materials , provided by the American Heart Association . The educational materials will promote management of risk factors and the notebook will provide an avenue for recording of lifestyle behaviors , such as health goals , BP values , and eating habits . •Participants enrolled in the run-in phase will complete the following assessments at three time points ( baseline , 6-months , and 12-months ) : Anthropometric measurements GHP data collection form International physical activity questionnaire ( iPAQ ) Lifestyle Assessment [ modified SF-36 questionnaire tailored to the Grenadian population ] Point-of-care testing using an LDX analyzer ( solely for the 12 month assessment ) . The investigators have developed a `` GHP Health outcomes Score '' which captures a person 's health profile on a 0-to-3 point scale related to smoking habits , overweight , sedentary lifestyle , and hypertension During the run-in phase , participants will attend a series of core lifestyle and risk factor education workshops related to motivation for change , nutrition ( two sessions ) , smoking cessation , physical education and BP control . Only those participants who attend 4 of the 6 sessions will be eligible for randomization . Eligible participants will be randomized to the intervention arm or to the control arm , stratified by parish . In the group intervention arm a group leader will be selected internally within the support groups , who will receive additional training from the research team in regards to group motivation and facilitation . Those randomized into the Intervention arm will be organized into peer groups of approximately 10 persons .

For patients with swallowing difficulties , administration of whole tablets can be problematic and tablets are cut or crushed to ease administration . In addition , if HIV patients develop opportunistic infections , patients can become severely ill and may end up on the intensive care . Patients at the intensive care might not be able to swallow medication . Therefore it is useful to know if it is possible to administer TRI through a different route , like a feeding tube . If TRI can be crushed or dissolved and given through a catheter it is also useful to know if it can be given with drip feed . Currently there is no information about crushing TRI tablets . Depending on the biopharmaceutical characteristics of a drug formulation , crushing tablets can lead to altered pharmacokinetics of drugs . This has been shown for some of the antiretroviral drugs , such as ritonavir , lopinavir , efavirenz and tenofovir . It is important to know whether pharmacokinetics are influenced by crushing of tablets as low concentrations are associated with virologic failure . Therefore higher doses or switching to other HIV-drugs might be needed . In addition , higher Cmax and/or exposure can lead to toxicity . As a result therapeutic drug monitoring is advised , or crushing the drug is a contra-indication based on the available data . It has been shown that DTG plasma concentration is influenced by food , with higher AUC en Cmax after a high-fat meal compared to administration in a fasted state . During clinical development , however , dolutegravir intake was studied without regard to food intake . Therefore , it is recommended that dolutegravir can be taken with or without food . In addition , it has been shown that simultaneous oral ingestion of antacids and dolutegravir gives a decrease in Cmax and AUC of dolutegravir . This interaction is not shown for co-ingestion with omeprazole , which makes it unlikely that this interaction is caused by a pH-lowering effect influencing the absorption of dolutegravir . It is probably a local gastrointestinal complexation phenomenon , similar to what has been observed with other HIV integrase inhibitors . A possible pharmacokinetic interaction between dolutegravir and complexation formers may be expected . Especially considering the active binding sites of dolutegravir which bind magnesium metal ion cofactors . It is currently unclear if certain foods or liquids containing high amounts of magnesium or other cations , like drip feed , can cause this same interaction . Therefore this study will be conducted to investigate whether crushed and suspended TRI and crushed and suspended TRI with drip feed are bioequivalent to taking TRI as a whole .",2015-09-30,"December 4, 2020","Inclusion Criteria : Subject is at least 18 and not older than 55 years of age at the day of screening .

Currently , there are no methods to fix the abnormal gene , however , animal studies suggest that the symptoms of RTT can be treated . Ketamine is a sedative or anesthetic , depending on the dose . The drug is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) and is commonly used in children and adults . Animal studies and case reports in humans suggest that ketamine may reduce the symptoms of Rett syndrome . The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of ketamine for treating breathing and behavioral symptoms of RTT .","Families will be asked to maintain current prescription medications during the expected three-month duration of the study . However , clinically indicated medication alterations will naturally be permitted and recorded . Each participant will experience four study days , separated by about a month . On three of the study days participants will be given Ketamine , and on the other day they will be given saline placebo . Studies will be conducted in the Cleveland Clinic 's General Clinical Research Unit which is an NIH-sponsored unit designed for studies such as this . Subjects will be admitted on the first day of each study sequence , and discharged the subsequent day . Study subjects will arrive at approximately 8:00 AM .

Medical College of Wisconsin,NCT02568007,Effects of Cyproheptadine on Growth and Behavior in Pediatric Feeding Disorders,Medical College of Wisconsin,4,0,Feeding Behaviors,Drug,Cyproheptadine,Treatment,,"The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of standard dosing of cyproheptadine for both cycled and continuous administration , as compared to no medication , on appetite stimulation and growth in the pediatric gastroenterology feeding team patient population . The secondary aim is to evaluate the effect , if any , of the suspected tachyphylaxis that is commonly associated with cyproheptadine use . The third aim will be to examine the type and duration of side effects of cyproheptadine in this population . The ultimate goal will be to create a standardized protocol for cyproheptadine therapy in children with feeding disorders and suboptimal growth .","BACKGROUND , SIGNIFICANCE , AND RATIONALE Failure to thrive or inadequate weight gain is a frequent complaint amongst patients seen by general pediatricians and pediatric gastroenterologists . The reasons behind this diagnosis vary widely including , but not limited to feeding disorders of diverse etiologies , poor environmental structure and inadequate intake , medication side effects , swallowing disorders , and a variety of underlying organic diseases . For most feeding disorders , behavioral feeding techniques and strategies to increase caloric intake is utilized to correct the suboptimal growth . However , feeding disorders are sometimes so imprinted that behavioral interventions may be insufficient to promote ideal growth or , if sufficient for growth , are inadequate in helping children avoid or graduate from nutritional support such as enteral tubes . For this reason , medications that promote and stimulate appetite and weight gain are frequently used in children with feeding disorders . In pediatric gastroenterology practice , cyproheptadine is the most commonly used drug for appetite stimulation , weight gain , and feeding intolerance in younger children with feeding disorders . A first generation histamine and serotonin antagonist , cyproheptadine is thought to promote appetite stimulation and weight gain by increasing insulin-like growth factor-1 ( IGF-1 ) concentration . It may also interact with receptors in the ventromedial hypothalamus and exert hormonal effects . While the exact mechanism of action is still being investigated , several studies have evaluated the benefits of cyproheptadine in select patient groups , including patients with cystic fibrosis , cancer , undernourished children , and children with feeding disorders . These studies have all reported that cyproheptadine promotes weight gain and stimulates appetite . Reported side effects of cyproheptadine in these studies are primarily related to drowsiness which tends to significantly improve or resolve within two weeks of use . Another undesired effect is the development of drug tolerance , i.e . tachyphylaxis . To avoid this , it is common clinical practice to cycle on and off the medication a few weeks each month . While a few studies report outcomes of the use of cyproheptadine in children with feeding disorders or failure to thrive , these studies have enrolled only small patient cohorts and there are no randomized trials in children enrolled in a feeding team program . Two recent studies examined the role of cyproheptadine in patients who are undernourished or followed in pediatric feeding programs . However , a randomized study examining the effects of continuous cyproheptadine versus a fixed cycled medication dosing versus abstaining from medication has not been performed in the pediatric gastroenterology population . OUTCOME MEASURES : Number of Participants in Study : The total number of patients required for this study is 75 ( 25 in each group ) . The groups consist of three treatment arms : continuous use of cyproheptadine cycled cyproheptadine or no drug intervention This number was derived from looking at past statistical data from other studies and using similar power , alpha error , and beta error . Investigators used Analysis of Variance ( ANOVA ) analysis for multiple groups looking at repeat measures within factors . Alpha error was 0.05 , Power 0.95 . Data Collection : The following categories of data will be collected ( see subsections list below ) : medical record number ( MRN ) , demographics , feeding behavior , side effects experience from use cyproheptadine , 24 hour diet recalls , medical history , and anthropometrics . Demographic Information : Data will be collected as part of the demographics questionnaire . This includes participant 's age , sex , ethnicity , identification of primary caretaker , caretaker 's relation to participant , caretaker education level , and caretaker marital status . Feeding Behavior Questionnaire : Patients/parents will complete the Mealtime Behavior Questionnaire ( MBQ ) . Participants ' guardians will complete the Mealtime Behavior Questionnaire ( MBQ ) . This is a validated , 31-item , parent-report questionnaire assessing the mealtime behavior structure in young children above 2 years . The questionnaire measures variables including : food refusals/avoidance food manipulation mealtime aggression and choking/gagging/vomiting related to meals . Each behavior is assigned a frequency scale with 1 corresponding to `` never '' and 5 corresponding to `` always . '' The MBQ then consist of a total score and four subcategory scores ( listed above ) . 24 Hour Diet Recall : Guardians of participants will be questioned weekly regarding oral intake ( type of food consumed and amount ) over the past 24 hrs . Caloric intake will be calculated based on these recalls and compared across duration of study . Cyproheptadine Side Effect Questionnaire : Guardians will undergo weekly questionnaire looking at common side effects of cyproheptadine . A list of side effects will be read to the participant 's guardians with positive ( yes ) or negative ( no ) replies if the participant has experienced individual side effects since the last survey . Medical Information : Data collected will include anthropometrics at initial and final visit ( weight , height , BMI , mid-arm circumference , upper arm skin fold ) , current and past medical diagnoses and surgeries , current medications , current gastrointestinal symptoms , dependence on tube feeds RISK CATEGORY : Research not involving greater than minimal risk to the children . KNOWN SIDE EFFECTS OF CYPROHEPTADINE : Cyproheptadine has both antihistamine and antiserotonergic and has side effects related to these mechanisms . These side effects include drowsiness or sleepiness , confusion , excitement , fatigue , insomnia , hallucinations , blurred vision , tinnitus , dizziness , tachycardia , increase perspiration , appetite stimulation , weight gain , constipation , diarrhea , changes in frequency of urination , thickening of secretions , and dry mucus membranes . Over-dosage can results in atropine-like effects as well as central nervous depression , convulsions . SECURITY OF DATA COLLECTED : All investigators have received Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ( HIPAA ) training and a certificate of completion for the Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative ( CITI ) training course on the protection of human research subjects before starting the review . Information derived from questionnaires , data collection will be compiled on one central data collection form . These forms will be coded ( have a special identifier number that is linked to patient 's MRN ) . The central database used for data collection will be password protected . A separate secure ( password protected ) database will link the coding number to the patient 's MRN . Only the principal investigator ( PI ) , co-investigators and the members of the study team will be gathering the data and have access to the study database . Paper records will be locked in file cabinets within the Gastroenterology office area and electronic records will be stored in password-protected computers . Each subject 's identifying number and related electronic data will be kept on a secured , password-protected database that provides access only to the PI and research staff . Only authorized research personnel will have access to the databases and paper records . PROVISION FOR THE PROTECTION OF PRIVACY OF SUBJECTS ( confidentiality , health and financial risks ) AND TO MAINTAIN THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF DATA : Data will be stored on Medical College of Wisconsin secured shared drives . PROVISIONS FOR MONITORING DATA TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF SUBJECTS ; AND ADDITIONAL SAFEGUARDS TO PROTECT THE RIGHTS AND WELFARE OF SUBJECTS WHO ARE LIKELY TO BE VULNERABLE : The PI will monitor the health of all patients in the study per standard clinical practice . Primary and Co-investigators will monitor protocol adherence and supervise data collection , entry , and analysis . ANTICIPATED BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROTOCOL ( value or desired outcome / advantage ) TO HUMAN RESEARCH PARTICIPANTS AND SOCIETY ( medical , psychosocial , altruistic ) Anticipated direct benefits of this study include the improvement in appetite/behavior and growth amongst the patients receiving cyproheptadine . These benefits may also be present in group abstaining from cyproheptadine due to standard education that is given to all groups . However , the investigators anticipate these benefits to be significantly lower in this group as compared to patients who are on cyproheptadine . Long-term benefits include the creation and utilization of a protocol outlining the use of cyproheptadine in feeding team patients . The results of this study will also address the side effect profile of cyproheptadine in this population . It may also further investigators ' knowledge of the treatment approaches that are most successful , allowing physicians to develop standardized care to better serve these patients and their families . STOPPING POINTS THAT WOULD NOT ALLOW THE STUDY TO CONTINUE AS PROPOSED : Stopping points for the study include achieving adequate information on enough of the goal subjects , inability to obtain enough data , or patients/caregivers electing to discontinue the study . DESCRIBE HOW THE CONSENT ( AND ASSENT , IF APPLICABLE ) PROCESS WILL TAKE PLACE . INCLUDE A LIST OF APPROPRIATELY TRAINED PERSONNEL WHO WILL BE INVOLVED . Written informed consent for participation will be obtained from guardians for their child 's participation . Consent will be obtained by study personnel at the participant 's appointment in the GI Clinic . Participants ' consent will allow for accessing information collected for program evaluation/clinical purposes . Participants ' guardians will have the option of having the consent document read aloud to them to facilitate understanding . Copies of signed consent documents will be given to participants ' guardians . Consent will be obtained by the study 's principal investigator , co-investigators , or members of the research team . As additional research staff or team members are added , their names will be submitted to the International Review Board ( IRB ) as a protocol amendment to allow them to obtain consent . PROCEDURES TO BE EMPLOYED IN ANALYZING DATA ( including a power analysis ) AND THE ANTICIPATED SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROPOSED STUDY Analyses will be conducted with Statistical Package for the Social Sciences ( SPSS ) and Statistical Analysis System ( SAS ) software programs . Probability levels of < .05 will be used as cut offs for statistical significance . Descriptive analyses will examine distribution normality and the extent to which parametric test assumptions are met . Descriptive analyses will also provide summary information about participant characteristics . Pearson correlations will be used to examine relationships between continuous variables , while chi square analyses will examine associations between categorical variables . The key significance of this study is the analysis of the effect that cyproheptadine has on stimulating weight gain and improving behaviors associated with feeding . In addition , it will help give clear comparison between the use of continuous versus cycled cyproheptadine . Cyproheptadine has been suspected to have tachyphylaxis after a couple weeks and many practitioners implement cycling of medication without clear evidence supporting this practice . Investigators expect after this study to be able to design a protocol regarding use of cyproheptadine in feeding team patients .

Subjects will be randomized to one of 4 doses of T3D-959 . Subjects will be evaluated for changes from baseline in cerebral metabolic rate of glucose ( FDG-PET imaging ) , functional connectivity of the hippocampus ( BOLD-fMRI ) , and cognitive function ( ADAS-Cog11 and DSST ) as well as assessed for safety and tolerability to T3D-959 . An expanded access extension is planed to provide access to study medication to subjects who have completed the main study and requested continued use .","T3D-959 is an orally-delivered , once-a-day administered , small molecule dual nuclear receptor agonist that has been shown in animal and Phase 1 studies in normal human subjects to be safe and well tolerated . The purpose of this clinical study in AD patients is to demonstrate mechanistic proof of concept that T3D-959 , can produce desired changes in cerebral glucose metabolism and functional connectivity that may indicate potential for cognitive improvement . The therapeutic approach to be tested is based on two suppositions ; ( A ) ameliorating multiple pathologies in the disease with a single therapy may provide a superior clinical benefit than therapeutic approaches which target a single pathology and ( B ) correcting insulin resistance in the brain , ( highly correlated with AD and potential key driver of AD pathophysiology ) and peripherally may be disease remedial . The brain requires integral insulin signaling for metabolic homeostasis and neuronal plasticity . Insulin resistance disrupts energy balance and signaling networks needed for a broad range of functions . Impaired insulin signaling in neurons enhances apoptosis , promotes oxidative cell death induced by Abeta1-42 , increases secretion of Abeta1-42 , blocks removal of extracellular Abeta oligomers and increases plaque loads . A growing body of evidence suggests that brain insulin resistance promotes or possibly is the trigger of key pathologies in AD and is supported by observed changes in levels of insulin signaling molecules in AD forebrains and associated changes in memory . Pre-clinical studies in animals have demonstrated the insulin sensitizing activity of T3D-959 and ability to improve multiple pathologies of AD in a rat model of disease . This non-placebo controlled trial will be conducted in one to three clinical centers . Thirty six ( 36 ) patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer 's disease will be randomly assigned to once daily , orally administered treatment with 3mg , 10mg , 30mg or 90mg doses of T3D-959 .

The potential for initial caries to develop into manifest lesions has motivated studies on the use of sealants to arrest the progression of caries on both occlusal and approximal tooth surfaces . Therefore , the aim of the present study was to follow-up and examine after 3.5 years , the efficacy of sealing caries-free or non-cavitated mesial surfaces of first permanent molars abutting lesions on the distal surfaces of second primary molars . The null hypothesis tested here was that preventive and therapeutic sealants do not prevent the development or slow the progression of dental caries over a period of 3.5 years in comparison to non-sealed control surfaces .","The study population comprised 121 schoolchildren aged 8 to 10 years in a high-caries community in Valparaiso , Chile .

Ganetespib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth . Studying samples of blood and tissue in the laboratory from patients receiving ganetespib may help doctors learn more about the effects of ganetespib on cells . It may also help doctors understand how well patients respond to treatment .,"Ganetespib is a small molecule inhibitor of HSP90 that is currently being studied in several ongoing clinical trials . Investigators have demonstrated that ganetespib sensitizes colorectal cell lines to the effects of chemo radiotherapy in vitro . Ganetespib may have an anti-tumor effect in head and neck cancer . The investigators propose this pilot study as a first step to examine the activity of ganetespib in patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck ( SCCHN ) who have a planned surgical resection . Ganetespib has not been investigated in SCCHN . This protocol is a window of opportunity trial that will be looking at whether there is a rationale for pursuing this agent in future development of clinical trials that would then focus on therapeutic interventions with or without radiotherapy . There are therefore no clinical trials currently opened using ganetespib in SCCHN and listed on ClinicalTrials.gov . It is not clear if patients who receive this drug prior to surgery will benefit from this intervention . In this study , ganetespib will be administered twice weekly ( doses approximately 72 hours apart ) for 2 weeks , followed by surgery the day after the last dose of the study drug . There will be 3 dose levels , 80 , 100 and 150mg/m² as highest dose . These doses were chosen based on the following considerations . In a Phase 1 study ( protocol 9090-01 ) investigating a twice-weekly ganetespib treatment schedule , doses up to 173 mg/m² were well tolerated , with manageable diarrhea and fatigue being the most common adverse events . Extensive correlative studies and pharmacokinetic ( PK ) /pharmacodynamic ( PD ) modeling of preclinical data suggest that in humans the effective dose range for ganetespib is 70-150 mg/m² . Therefore , 80 mg/m² is within the range of ganetespib effectiveness and 150 mg/m² twice weekly is a well-tolerated dose .",2015-01-06,"July 22, 2016","Inclusion Criteria : Patients must have pathologically-confirmed , resectable , squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity , oropharynx , larynx or hypopharynx Disease may be stage I , II , III or IVa ( as long as it is deemed resectable by the surgical team ) Tumor must be surgically resectable and curable with conventional surgery Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0-2 Patients must give documented informed consent to participate in this study Absolute-neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1500/mm³ Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm³ Total bilirubin ≤ within upper limit of normal ( ULN ) Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) and aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) ≤ 2.5 x ULN Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN Lipase levels < 1.5 x ULN Amylase levels 470 ms ( average of triplicate electrocardiogram [ ECG ] recordings ) ; a consistent method of QTc calculation must be used for each patient 's QTc measurements ; QTcF ( Fridericia 's formula ) is preferred Serum potassium , magnesium , or calcium levels in the following ranges : Potassium 5.1 mmol/L Magnesium 2.4 mg/dL Calcium 10.5 mg/dL",3,0,19 Years,79 Years

Most of this change comes from a combination of medicines that is yielding high cure rates . But its long-term effects are uncertain . One problem is that a lot of people need the treatment , but only a few specialists can give it . The success rate for Hepatitis C treatment by primary care doctors , nurse practitioners , or physician assistants is largely unknown . Researchers want to see how provider type affects treatment outcomes . They will conduct a large , community-based study in the District of Columbia . Objectives : - To see if people can be treated for Hepatitis C safely and successfully in community-based health centers . Eligibility : - Adults who need treatment for chronic Hepatitis C infection . Design : Participants will be screened with blood tests . Their current medicines will be reviewed . Participants will give researchers access to their medical records . Researchers will follow participants through these records . Participants will see a primary care or infectious disease provider . The provider will tell them about their treatment . They will be told how often they will visit the provider and how often they will have their blood drawn . They will get a calendar of study visits . Participants will take Harvoni for 8 , 12 , or 24 weeks . They will visit their care provider monthly . Participants will have monthly follow-up visits for up to 3 months after they finish their medicine . Participants will have yearly follow-up visits with their care provider for up to 10 years .","Treatment for hepatitis C has been revolutionized in the last 2 years with the advent of combination antiviral therapy yielding high cure rates ; although , the long term effects of treatment remain uncertain . Use of these medications has been limited to clinical trial settings typically by highly specialized care teams in tertiary care hospitals . As the prevalence of hepatitis C is significant , there exists a significant imbalance between patients who require treatment and specialists who provide treatment . Success rates in treatment of hepatitis C by primary care doctors or physician extenders , such as nurse practitioners or physician assistants , is largely unknown . As such , we propose the first community-based , large scale , longitudinal study of directly acting antiviral ( DAA ) -based treatment for chronic hepatitis C , set in the District of Columbia . Within this study , approximately 600 HCV genotype 1 monoinfected and HCV/HIV coinfected subjects will be treated with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir ( 90 mg/400 mg ) fixed dosed combination for 8-24 weeks , based on the medication labeling instructions , and followed for both immediate ( SVR12 ) and long term ( comorbid disease , cirrhosis , hepatocellular carcinoma , transplantation and mortality ) outcomes over a 10 year study period . The study will be conducted exclusively in the District of Columbia clinics associated with the NIH DC Partnership for AIDS/HIV Progress ( DC PFAP ) , which serves a population comprised primarily of minorities , with a high degree of negative predictors of treatment response . In this study , participants will be assigned to treatment either by ( 1 ) an ID or hepatology specialist , ( 2 ) primary care provider , or ( 3 ) physician extender . Please see Figure 1 study schema for an approximate distribution of subjects . Each of these provider groups will undergo uniform training on treatment of hepatitis C and management of adverse events prior to initiation of study . All subjects will sign informed consent and agree to treatment and follow up phases of the study . During the course of the study , subjcts will be clinically evaluated based on American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases ( AASLD ) / the Infectious Diseases Society of America ( IDSA ) guidelines for the management of hepatitis C. Clinical data from subjects will be captured in a city wide cohort database , which will store guideline-driven data points from each clinic visit within the network . Through this trial we will explore the efficacy of managing hepatitis C subjects with directly acting antiviral therapy in an urban , community-based setting , and investigate the effect of provider type ( specialist , primary care , or physician extender ) on treatment outcome . We will detail the safety and tolerability of this treatment . We will assess variability in treatment outcomes between monoinfected and HIV-coinfected subjects . Finally , we will evaluate the public health impact of large-scale treatment of HCV infected subjects in preventing long-term clinical outcomes . As the first interferon ( IFN ) - and ribavirin ( RBV ) -free , urban community-based treatment utilizing new standard of care criteria , this study will serve as a model for implementation of similar practice patterns globally .",2015-01-14,"July 16, 2018","INCLUSION CRITERIA : Male or female at least 18 years of age at time of screening who is determined to be eligible based on evaluation by a treating provider , Documentation of genotype 1 ( GT-1 ) infection , liver fibrosis staging by any AASLD/IDSA guideline approved measurement , and HIV status determination .

Sickle cell disease is a disorder in which red blood cells ( RBCs ) are abnormally shaped . This can result in painful episodes , serious infections , and damage to body organs . One medication used to treat sickle cell disease is hydroxyurea . Hydroxyurea therapy offers significant benefits for infants , children , and adolescents with sickle cell anemia . These include a reduction in the frequency of pain crises and acute chest syndrome ( inflammation of the lungs ) . Hydroxyurea has been given to many HbSC patients but HbSC patients were not included in the large clinical trials used to test hydroxyurea in SCD , so less is known about how HbSC patients respond to hydroxyurea . The purpose of this research study is to see if hydroxyurea , a medication given to many children with the most common type of sickle cell , those who are homozygous for the sickle mutation ( HbSS ) , helps children who have HbSC . The investigators will see if it helps by giving a questionaire when the medication is started , and then every two months at a clinic visit . The questionaire , called the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory ( PedsQL™ ) Sickle Cell Disease Module version 3.0 , measures quality of life .

This is called acute graft-versus-host-disease ( GVHD ) . Researchers want to see if bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells ( BMSC ) can help treat GVHD . BMSC can travel in the body and help repair tissue . The BMSC in this study were grown from bone marrow from healthy volunteers . Objectives : - To test whether BMSC are safe to use soon after GVHD is diagnosed and to see how the body s immune system responds to BMSC . Eligibility : - People over 4 years old who had a stem cell transplant at NIH and now have acute GVHD . People who have had certain previous immunosuppressive therapy may be ineligible . Design : Participants will be screened with medical history , physical exam , and blood tests . They will have a GVHD exam , including skin and stool tests . They must have a functioning central line . Participation will last 11 weeks : 4 8 weeks of cell infusions , then follow-up for the rest of the weeks . Up to 12 cell infusions : Participants will come to the clinic twice weekly . They will get medicine to prevent side effects ( like Tylenol and Benadryl ) . BMSC will be given through a small plastic tube in an arm vein or through an IV catheter . It will last 20 60 minutes . Participants will be monitored for 1 hour . Follow-up visits : Up to twice a week , participants will have physical exam and blood tests . They may have a GVHD exam . Participants who have a tissue biopsy outside the study will be asked to send a sample to the study .","This is a pilot study evaluating the addition of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell ( BMSC ) infusions to corticosteroids for the early treatment of acute graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) . Acute GVHD is a major complication following allogeneic stem cell transplant . GVHD occurs when T-lymphocytes in the donor graft respond to signals from recipient cells and cause tissue damage . This process can lead to organ injury , increased risk of infection , and graft failure . Corticosteroids have been used as the primary therapy for acute GVHD for decades , and guidelines currently recommend their use as front line treatment . Recent prospective data from the Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network shows that GVHD will be cured in about half of patients with steroids alone . Patients who do not respond to steroids are considered steroid-resistant , and this is associated with much worse survival . It is possible to predict which patients will go on to have steroid-resistant GVHD by measuring the plasma concentration of the molecule called suppression of tumorigenicity 2 ( ST2 ) . BMSC infusions have been used to treat steroid-resistant acute GVHD successfully , but despite a track record of safety , little is known about the use of BMSC in the early treatment setting . The main objective of this study is to explore the feasibility of administering BMSC within 5 days of diagnosis of acute GVHD . Our study will for the first time use the ST2 biomarker to more accurately assign acute GVHD to steroid refractory or sensitive , and explore changes in ST2 and other biological markers of BMSC function and their correlation with clinical response . In the process of this study , we will assess the safety and feasibility of early treatment according to our regimen , obtain estimates of efficacy at important GVHD therapy time points , and determine if treatment with BMSC can prevent the progression of GVHD in patients with high risk of GVHD progression as measured by biomarkers . The Cell Processing Section of the Department of Transfusion Medicine at the Clinical Center NIH has developed a BMSC repository at NIH . The NIH BMSC are a third party , early passage product based on the EU manufacturing approach . The NIH BMSC cellular product was administered safely to transplant recipients with steroid-resistant acute GVHD in a phase I study ( protocol 12-H-0010 , IND # 14596 ) conducted from March 2012 to October 2012 at NIH . This pilot study is a continuation of the previous study and open to allogeneic stem cell transplantation recipients at NIH ( age greater than or equal to 4 yrs ) with de novo acute GVHD requiring systemic therapy either directly after allogeneic transplantation or following treatment with donor lymphocyte infusion . Subjects will receive BMSC infusions ( target dose of 2 times 10 ( 6 ) BMSC/kg for up to 12 doses ) in addition to standard upfront therapy with corticosteroids . The primary endpoint will be the proportion of patients without a treatment-related severe adverse event ( TRSAE ) at day +56 . Responses will be assessed at day +28 and +56 from the initial diagnosis . Responses will be correlated to changes in GVHD biomarkers including ST2 , Reg3a , TNFR1 , and IL-6 . Subjects will be enrolled at first diagnosis of acute GVHD , and the first BMSC infusion will be given within 120 hours of the first dose of corticosteroids . BMSC infusions will be given twice weekly for the first 4 weeks . Subjects with a complete response at the end of week 4 will not receive further infusions . All other subjects will receive BMSC infusions weekly for four additional weeks . Safety will be monitored continuously with a stopping rule for toxicity based on the treatment-related serious adverse event rate . Research samples will be drawn at regular intervals to explore biological correlates of response and to investigate the mechanism of action of BMSC .",2015-03-04,"April 8, 2019","INCLUSION CRITERIA : History of any grade acute GVHD requiring systemic therapy after allogeneic stem cell transplant or DLI . -- Subjects must have received an allogeneic stem cell transplant at NIH and be diagnosed with acute GVHD . Acute GVHD is defined using the NIH consensus definition inclusive of classic acute ( less than or equal to 100 days after transplant or DLI , presence of acute GVHD features , absence of chronic GVHD features ) AND persistent/recurrent/late onset acute ( > 100 days after transplant or DLI , presence of acute GVHD features , absence of chronic GVHD features ) . Subjects with stage I and II skin only ( overall Grade I ) or isolated upper gastrointestinal involvement are eligible if the treating physician deems that systemic corticosteroid treatment is indicated . Biopsy confirmation of GVHD is desirable , but not required for study entry because enrollment should not be delayed awaiting biopsy or pathology results . Patients must be diagnosed with a first episode of acute GVHD requiring systemic corticosteroids and associated with preceding administration of a cellular therapy including stem cells and donor lymphocyte infusion . Patients who were treated for GVHD associated with another cellular therapy product ( e.g . prior allogeneic transplant or DLI ) will be allowed into the study . Previous immunosuppressive therapy The patient must have received no systemic immune suppressive therapy for treatment of new acute GVHD ( e.g . pentostatin , etanercept , denileukin difitox , etc . ) , except for a maximum 120 hours prior corticosteroid therapy . This does not include immune suppressive therapy for GVHD prophylaxis ( e.g . calcineurin inhibitor , sirolimus , MMF , etc. ) . It is expected that most patients will be receiving GVHD prophylaxis as part of their transplant regimen , thus patients developing acute GVHD while on GVHD prophylaxis will still be considered eligible . Concurrent or addition of locally-acting steroid therapy ( skin creams , oral budesonide , or any other locally-acting steroid preparation ) is allowed . There is one exception to the above stipulations : Use of the oral medication MMF ( in addition to systemic corticosteroids ) for the treatment of acute GVHD will be allowed . MMF is commonly given early in the treatment of acute GVHD , but it has not been shown to improve outcomes compared to steroids alone in a randomized , prospective study ; therefore , treatment with MMF will not exclude patients from BMSC treatment . Age : Age greater than or equal to 4 years old will be allowed . Birth control : Subjects of childbearing or child-fathering potential must be willing to use a medically acceptable form of birth control , which includes abstinence , while they are being treated on this study . Informed consent : Signed informed consent and/or assent is required . Assent and educational materials will be provided to , and reviewed with , patients under the age of 18 . The informed consent process will begin at recognition of patient eligibility . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Breast feeding or pregnant females ( due to unknown risk to fetus or newborn ) .

University of Pennsylvania,NCT02371889,"A Randomized, Double-blind Placebo-Controlled Pharmacogenetic Study of Topiramate in European-American Heavy Drinkers",University of Pennsylvania,2,1,Alcoholism,Drug,Topiramate,Treatment,Triple,"The purpose of this study is to advance the effort to develop personalized pharmacotherapy for alcohol use disorders ( AUDs ) . The investigators propose to conduct a 12-week , prospective , randomized clinical trial of the moderating effect of rs2832407 on the efficacy of TOP in reducing heavy drinking ( HD ) in 200 individuals of European descent with DSM-5 AUD . The investigators will stratify the randomization on genotype and oversample rs2832407 * C homozygotes , the most TOP-responsive genotype , to ensure comparable numbers of patients in the four medication x genotype groups . The investigators will use daily data collection to examine changes in relevant process variables ( e.g. , alcohol expectancies ) and their interaction with genotype and medication group as predictors of HD . The proposed study is innovative in that it will be the first prospective test of a pharmacogenetic hypothesis involving TOP ; it will use daily reports to examine expectancies and how they interact with medication and genotype to predict HD ; and it will enroll DSM-5 AUD patients whose goal is either to reduce or stop drinking , which will increase the study 's external validity .","This is a 12-week , prospective , randomized clinical trial of the moderating effect of rs2832407 on the efficacy of topiramate in reducing HD in 200 individuals of European descent with DSM-5 AUD . The investigators will stratify the randomization on genotype and oversample rs2832407 * C homozygotes , the most topiramate-responsive genotype , to ensure comparable numbers of subjects in the four medication x genotype groups . The investigators will compare the efficacy of topiramate to placebo in reducing the frequency of HDDs in subjects with AUD using a two-arm , parallel-groups design . Subjects will either have a goal of reducing their drinking to safe levels or abstinence . The investigators will use daily data collection to examine changes in relevant process variables and their interaction with genotype and medication group as predictors of HD . At each visit , all subjects will receive Medication Management ( Pettinati , Weiss et al . 2004 ) , which was developed for the COMBINE Trial and which the investigators modified to be relevant for both reducing heavy drinking and promoting abstinence . Random assignment to treatment group and double-blind conditions will be maintained throughout the study . Raters will be trained in the reliable use of all assessments . The investigators will use serum GGTP and percent disialotransferrin ( % dCDT ) , an improved assay for carbohydrate deficient transferrin , to validate subject reports . Following a one-week pre-treatment assessment period , subjects will receive 12 weeks of treatment , after which there will be a 6-day taper period , during which subjects will reduce their dosage of topiramate gradually and then discontinue it completely . Daily reports during the treatment period will be obtained using interactive voice response ( IVR ) to identify subjective correlates of medication effects and to monitor medication use . Following the 12-week treatment period , subjects will be asked to return to the clinic for 3-month and 6-month post-treatment follow-up visits to evaluate the durability of treatment effects . Two hundred men and women of European descent will be randomized to study medication . Subjects will be recruited using referrals from treatment programs throughout Philadelphia ; IRB-approved advertisements on mass transit , on local radio and television stations and in newspapers , social media , and broadcast email messages at institutions that offer such a service and by posting/distributing recruitment materials in community and college settings . Respondents will initially be evaluated by telephone prior to an in-person visit to the Treatment Research Center of the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine . The investigators will select subjects based on their genotype to ensure comparable numbers of individuals who are rs2832407 * C-allele homozygotes and A-allele carriers .

Among patients insufficiently controlled with metformin multimorbidity and polypharmacy is common that makes the patients frail for cardiovascular complications related to hypoglycemic events . This exploratory double blind randomized active controlled study is designed to assess the effects of a treatment with therapeutical dosage of sitagliptin versus therapeutical dosage of glimepiride as add on therapy in patients with T2DM patients inadequately controlled on metformin monotherapy . Examinations will be performed as a 5 day recording of subcutaneous glucose concentration ( CGMS ) and holder ECG ( AMEDTEC ) at baseline and after a 12 weeks treatment with sitagliptin or glimepiride as active comparators used in combination with metformin . With recording of nocturnal hypoglycemia and arrhythmias it is aimed to evaluate favorable glycemic profile under treatment with sitagliptin compared to glimepiride . The primary objective is risk of serious HE for both drugs . The glycemic profile of sitagliptin as add-on therapy to metformin seems to be favorable compared to sulfonylureass such as glimepiride . Treatment with sitagliptin as add-on to metformin therapy causes less glycemic fluctuations and may be associated with lower oxidative stress and down regulation of low grade inflammation .

The objectives are therefore to assess parameters of beta cell survival ( including new biomarkers ) , insulin production and glucose control and the feasibility of this approach and thereby provide the basis for future , larger/expanded , longer-term verapamil studies and the off-label use of this approved drug for Type 1 Diabetes ( T1D ) .","Loss of pancreatic beta-cell mass is a key factor in T1D , but therapies to halt this process are not available . The investigators have discovered thioredoxin-interacting protein ( TXNIP ) , as a promising target in this regard and have now found that the commonly used anti-hypertensive drug and calcium channel-blocker , verapamil , effectively lowers beta-cell TXNIP expression in rodent beta-cells and human islets , promotes beta-cell survival and rescues mice from T1D . This makes verapamil a potentially attractive drug for T1D , but prospective clinical data are lacking . The investigators primary objective is therefore to conduct a randomized , placebo-controlled , double-blind study of the efficacy and safety of verapamil in adults with recent-onset T1D and to demonstrate that subjects on oral verapamil daily for 12 months will have improved insulin production ( as an indirect measure of beta-cell mass ) .

There are no pharmacological treatments approved for the treatment of ARDS . This pilot trial will study the safety and efficacy of Treprostinil sodium by inhalation for preventing the progression of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure to positive pressure ventilation and/or ARDS in patients at high risk .","ARDS is defined by acute hypoxemia , respiratory failure and the presence of bilateral lung infiltrates . ARDS is a syndrome of inflammation and increased permeability that may coexist with left atrial or pulmonary capillary hypertension . Several recent trials in ARDS / ALI ( Acute Lung Injury ) have generated interest in the use of Prostacyclin ( PGI2 ) and prostacyclin analogs in improving oxygenation in ARDS / ALI . PGI2 is an arachidonic acid metabolite naturally produced in the lung by endothelial cells , dendritic cells , smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts . PGI2 is a potent selective pulmonary vasodilator and inhibitor of platelet aggregation . The cellular effects include smooth muscle relaxation , inhibition of cell migration , decreased dextran permeability in epithelial cell cultures in vitro , decreased high tidal volume mechanical ventilation injury in mice and inhibition of fibroblast adhesion and differentiation . PGI2 has broad anti-inflammatory activity , inhibiting the production of Tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNFα ) , interleukin 1 beta ( IL-1β ) , interleukin 6 ( IL-6 ) and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GMCSF ) in human alveolar macrophages . The study objectives are : To assess the feasibility of a randomized trial of treprostinil inhalation in patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure not requiring positive pressure ventilation .

Eczema lesions may appear as collection of fluid in the skin ( vesicles ) or as gross thickening of the skin ( lichenification ) with redness . It is also associated with crusting , scaling , cracking , and swelling of the skin . Usually , it does not need medical treatment . However , a more severe form of eczema is referred to as atopic eczema or atopic dermatitis which occurs in childhood or early adulthood . The overall prevalence of this condition in Northern Europe is 15-20 % of children aged 7-18 years . Atopic eczema greatly affects the quality of life of the individuals and in fact accounts for the highest scores when compared with other dermatological diseases . A child with eczema experiences itch and sleep disturbances , ostracism by other children , the need for special clothing and bedding , avoidance of physical activities such as swimming and the need for frequent application of ointments . Eczema is commonly treated with antihistamine pills and creams or ointments . Antihistamines and steroid creams control the itching and rash caused by severe eczema . It is also recommended that the skin be well lubricated to prevent it from becoming dry . A systematic review of randomized clinical trials on atopic eczema summarized the interventions for treating the condition which include pharmacological drug type ( topical steroids ) , similar intervention type ( dietary measures ) or convenience ( non-pharmacological treatments ) . Shea butter , which contains stearic acid , linoleic acid , and catechins ( antioxidants ) , is processed from nut of the Vitellaria paradoxa tree . It is traditionally used as lotion for the skin and hair as it is considered an emollient and skin conditioning agent . It has also been of importance in soothing arthritic pains , reducing swelling , treating skin problems , and as antiseptic for wounds . Shea butter is also found in topical formulations used for inflammatory dermatoses such as psoriasis and atopic dermatitis . Shea butter consists of triterpene cinnamates and acetates and these were found to have anti-inflammatory activity which can help in the reduction of edema associated with eczema . Human clinical studies have demonstrated shea butter as skin aging treatment which regenerates skin and gives smoother , clearer skin . Wrinkles from photoaging were also diminished . Another trial showed that shea butter has cicatrizing action in 70 % of cases of hand dermatitis , sun burns and scars . A cream with shea butter was also demonstrated to promote good moisturization of the skin compared to placebo . Macadamia nut oil is one of the most heart-friendly oils . It contains vitamin E , omega-3 , omega-6 , oleic , linoleic , and palmitoleic acids . Macadamia oil decreases low density lipoprotein levels and increases high density lipoprotein levels thus reducing risk of heart diseases . There are various benefits of macadamia oil on skin . It provides moisturization and anti-aging effects . Palmitoleic acid , which is commonly found in the skin , decreases as people age . Macadamia oil helps replace the lost compound to maintain youthful skin . Blemishes and scars are also removed with the help of macadamia oil . It has anti-inflammatory activity and antioxidant effects thus reducing free radicals on the skin and providing healing of skin conditions such as sunburns .

In this study , metformin will be compared to a placebo . A placebo is not a drug . It looks like the study drug , but it is not designed to treat any disease or illness . It is designed to be compared with a study drug to learn if the study drug has any real effect .","Study Groups : If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study , you will be randomly assigned ( as in a roll of dice ) to 1 of 2 groups . This is done because no one knows if one study group is better , the same , or worse than the other group . You will have a 1 out of 3 chance of being in Group 1 and a 2 out of 3 chance of being in Group 2 . If you are in Group 1 , you will take placebo pills . If you are in Group 2 , you will take metformin pills . Neither you nor the study staff will know if you are receiving the study drug or the placebo . However , if needed for your safety , the study staff will be able to find out what you are receiving . Study Drug Administration : You should take the pills 2 times a day at about the same time every day , preferably with food ( for example , with breakfast and dinner ) . You will start taking the pills about 12 days before your paclitaxel treatment starts . This is called the `` adaptation period . '' It is meant to allow your body to get used to the study pills . The study staff will check you for allergic reactions or other negative reactions to the pills during this period . If you are not tolerating the pills , you will be taken off study . About every 3 weeks while you are receiving paclitaxel , you should bring the study drug/placebo container ( along with any leftover pills ) to the clinic . The study staff will count the number of pills you have taken . Study Visits : Every week during the study , either during your clinic visit or by phone , the study staff will ask you about any side effects you may be having , if you have taken the study drug/placebo , and how many pills you have taken so far .

"University of Colorado, Denver",NCT02366845,Prospective Validation of a Plasma Transfusion Dosing Algorithm in Patients With Chronic Liver Disease,"University of Colorado, Denver",4,1,Liver Disease,Biological,Fresh Frozen Plasma,Treatment,Single,"This study plans to learn more about transfusion of a human blood component called plasma in patients who have liver problems . Patients are asked to be in this study because they have liver disease and therefore may require the transfusion of plasma . The dose of plasma required to reach certain blood clotting laboratory targets is usually determined by clinicians . Due to the complexity of the patient 's blood clotting disorder , determining the appropriate dose of plasma is very difficult . The investigators have developed a dosing table based on information from other patients with liver disease and the investigators are testing it to see if it is a more accurate dosing tool then clinician chosen dosing of plasma in patients with liver disease who need one or more plasma transfusions","Clinicians currently transfuse plasma to International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) targets without an understanding of the dose response characteristics of plasma in bleeding patients with liver disease . Epidemiologic studies show that INR is infrequently corrected to target INR values after clinician chosen plasma transfusion doses in patients with liver disease . Plasma transfusion is frequently given to patients prior to procedures and during active bleeding in this patient population though there are no dosing guidelines to aid clinicians in reaching INR targets in patients with liver disease . Previous studies suggest that patients with liver disease may need more plasma then patients without liver disease to correct any given pre-transfusion INR ( INR value measured before plasma transfusion ) to the same post-transfusion INR target ( INR value measured after plasma transfusion ) . Current physician dosing of plasma is variable and rarely successful at reaching stated INR targets . The INR thresholds , commonly used triggers for plasma transfusion by Gastro-Intestinal ( GI ) , Hepatology and critical care physicians at our institution range from 1.5-3.0 in bleeding or pre-procedural patients with liver disease representing tremendous variability . When we evaluated plasma transfusion dosing practices in bleeding patients with liver disease over 8 years , we demonstrated that these same physicians rarely met stated theoretical targets . Over or under dosing plasma in these patients may lead to serious clinical complications.The target INR goal was to be within ±0.1 after the first round of FFP transfusion , and was selected because underdosing can result in prolonged bleeding , delayed procedure times , and more rounds of FFP transfusion . Furthermore , overdosing can result in excess cost , increased portal pressures , bleeding , transfusion associated circulatory overload ( TACO ) , and transfusion related acute lung injury ( TRALI ) .",2015-02-04,"October 7, 2019","Inclusion Criteria : Subjects will be eligible to participate in the study if they meet all of the following criteria : Admission to the University of Colorado Hospital or Denver Health hospital and the clinical care team plans to transfuse the patient plasma to target a specific INR value .

Cure is not possible but the virus can be controlled with the use of antiviral medicines , . Researchers think that adding a second antiviral medicine might help . Objective : - To understand how peginterferon might help treat people with chronic hepatitis B . Also , to see if peginterferon is safe to use with other antiviral medications . Eligibility : - Adults age 18 and older who have chronic hepatitis B and had therapy with 1 or more oral medicines for hepatitis B for at least 4 years . Design : Participants will be screened with physical exam and medical history . They will complete health questionnaires about their levels of fatigue and pain . They will have blood and urine tests . They may have an eye exam . Participants also will have a Fibroscan . A test to measure how stiff your liver is . Eligible participants will have a liver biopsy . Blood will be drawn . Participants will be admitted to the NIH Clinical Center . They will be injected with the study drug .

At the final visit , they will also have a Fibroscan .","Chronic hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) infection is a leading cause of liver associated morbidity and mortality . Currently available first-line therapies for treatment of chronic hepatitis B include pegylated interferon-alpha and the nucleos ( t ) ide analogues ( NUCs ) entecavir and tenofovir . These were shown to effectively suppress viral replication , but their ability to induce durable off-treatment response is limited to a small subset of patients . Combination treatment with peginterferon and NUCs has been attempted in several randomized controlled trials , with no apparent advantage over either agent given alone . In these studies however , treatment with peginterferon was initiated either simultaneously or shortly after NUCs administration . The efficacy of peginterferon following long-term viral suppression with NUCs was only tested in one small pilot study , nevertheless showing 60 % hepatitis B s antigen ( HBsAg ) loss rate . The underlying mechanisms responsible for improved efficacy of peginterferon in this setting are unknown and warrant further investigation . In this single arm study we propose to evaluate the efficacy and mechanisms associated with response to peginterferon add-on therapy following a minimum of 192 weeks of viral suppression induced by NUCs in a group of chronic HBV infected patients . Sixty patients with either hepatitis B e antigen ( HBeAg ) positive ( n=30 ) or negative ( n=30 ) chronic HBV infection will be enrolled to this study . After medical evaluation and pretreatment liver biopsy , treatment with subcutaneous injections of pegylated interferon alpha-2a 180 g per week will be given for a total of 24 weeks , followed by an off-treatment evaluation period of 48 weeks . A second liver biopsy will be performed six hours following the first peginterferon injection . Primary end-point for this study will be the change in interferon-stimulated-genes response before and after first interferon injection in responders versus non-responders to treatment . The responsiveness to IFN-based therapy of treatment responders vs nonresponders will additionally be evaluated by studying intrahepatic and peripheral blood natural killer cells . The study will also assess HBeAg and HBsAg loss and seroconversion rates in comparison to historical controls treated with either peginterferon or NUCs monotherapy . Finally , we will assess whether treatment responders develop an HBV-specific T cell response similar in quantity and quality to that of patients who spontaneously resolve HBV infection .",2015-02-14,"August 23, 2019","INCLUSION CRITERIA : Inclusion criteria : HBeAg positive group Age > 18 years and older , male or female .

Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai,NCT02369510,Does the Addition of Epinephrine Prolong the Duration of Spinal Anesthesia for Repeat Cesarean Section?,Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai,4,1,Spinal Anesthesia,Drug,Low-dose epinephrine,Supportive Care,Triple,"The purpose of this study is to investigate whether the addition of a medication called epinephrine to spinal medications prolongs the duration of the anesthesia . The medication standardly used in spinal anesthesia is a local anesthetic ( bupivacaine ) and an opiate pain medication ( morphine ) . These medications typically last about 2 hours . The investigators want to determine if adding epinephrine to the spinal medications prolongs the anesthetic without side effects . A longer duration of anesthesia may be useful in prolonged repeat cesarean section . Epinephrine is known to prolong the action of some local anesthetics , but the investigators want to specifically study combining it with the medications the investigators use regularly for cesarean section . You may qualify to take part in this research study because you are having a repeat cesarean section . Repeat cesarean sections sometimes last longer than 2 hours . The investigators want to determine if epinephrine will prolong the anesthetic .","Spinal anesthesia with bupivacaine is a commonly used anesthetic in the obstetric population . It is most frequently carried out as a single shot intrathecal injection . This method can be utilized for both labor analgesia and surgical anesthesia for cesarean section . One of the concerns in using a single shot spinal injection for surgical anesthesia is the duration of adequate surgical conditions . This concern is especially relevant to repeat cesarean sections , as each subsequent procedure has the potential to be more complex than the prior and , therefore , prolonged . A reliable way to prolong surgical anesthesia provided by single shot spinal injection of bupivacaine could prove invaluable in the setting of repeat cesarean section . It has been well documented that adding epinephrine to intrathecal lidocaine will increase its duration1 , but the evidence for augmenting the duration of anesthesia provided by adding epinephrine to bupivacaine is much more equivocal and less robust .

Rush University Medical Center,NCT02341963,A Pilot Clinical Trial of Oral Ketamine for Acute Pain Management After Amputation Surgery,Rush University Medical Center,1,0,Acute Pain Management,Drug,Oral Ketamine,Treatment,,The purpose of this pilot study is to test the safety of oral ketamine to treat acute pain after amputation surgery . The objective of the proposed research is to conclusively determine if oral ketamine is a safe alternative analgesic to opioid for acute pain in subjects undergoing elective amputation of the lower extremity . All participants will receive oral ketamine .,"A prospective open-label clinical trial to decrease the incidence of expected side effects of oral ketamine dose administered presurgery and postsurgery , in 10 subjects undergoing elective amputation of the lower extremity . The primary outcome measure is the incidence of adverse events . Secondary outcome measures are decreased acute pain levels and decreased incidence of stump and phantom limb pain at 6 months . Enrollment of participants will occur at Rush University Medical Center ( Rush ) , Chicago , Illinois . Consented participants will be included in the study undergoing elective amputation of the lower extremity from all causes . Rationale for using oral ketamine for acute pain after amputation surgery : The common analgesic , morphine , has a narrow therapeutic window and numerous side effects.1 Ketamine , is a chemically stable compound , non-opioid with analgesic properties at low doses . In addition , ketamine stimulates the cardio-respiratory system which is of great benefit in injured patients.2-4 Ketamine is generally administered by the intravenous ( IV ) route and provides analgesia via antagonism of the N-Methyl-D-Asparate ( NMDA ) receptor . Ketamine has the added benefit of a wide therapeutic safety index . IV ketamine has been shown to provide postoperative analgesia in many clinical trials ; in particular to reduce opioid consumption.5 Severe acute pain has been shown to progress to chronic pain due to central sensitization.6 Perioperative IV ketamine has been shown in limited studies to decrease the incidence of chronic pain after surgery . However , the IV route of administration of ketamine has limitations due to difficulties with IV placement in certain tactical situations . Therefore , the use of oral ketamine ( non-opioid ) for the purpose of acute pain management after trauma or surgery is highly desirable . Pharmacokinetic studies : Oral ketamine may seem disadvantageous because of 17 % bioavailability , mainly due to first-pass drug metabolism in the liver . However , there is not a wide variability in bioavailability from patient-to-patient ( mean 16.6 % , Standard Error ( SE ) = 2.8 % ) and hence a predictable oral dosing can be achieved . Although investigators have tested formulations with sublingual or buccal transmucosal administration of ketamine , in practice they fail to increase the ketamine bioavailability versus oral ketamine . Ketamine as nasal spray is problematic for acute use , since the amount of drug is difficult to control using an atomizer . Day 1 ( day of surgery ) Before Surgery : An analgesic dose of the oral ketamine ( 1.0 mg/kg ) will be administered one hour before surgery in the preoperative holding area . If the subject is experiencing any adverse events ( e.g . hallucinations ) from the 1.0 mg/kg pre-surgery dose of ketamine , then any further ketamine dosing will be delayed until the following day ( Day 2 ) . In addition , subsequent subjects will receive a 33 % reduction of the pre-surgery dose ( i.e . 0.67 mg/kg ) . After Surgery : In the recovery room , when subjects are able to swallow , and if there were no adverse events from the pre-surgery ketamine dose , oral ketamine ( 1.0 mg/kg ) will be administered ( but no earlier than 8 hours after the pre-surgery dose ) . No doses will be administered after midnight . If adverse events have not resolved by the next morning ( Day 2 ) , then oral ketamine will be discontinued . In addition , subsequent subjects will receive a 33 % reduction in the recovery room dose and/or the last dose of Day 1 . Day 2 ( first post-op day ) Subjects will receive oral ketamine ( 1.0 mg/kg ) 3 times/day . The first dose will be administered at 6 AM .If a subject experiences any adverse events after the first dose , but one that resolves within 8 hours after that dose , the second dose will be reduced by 33 % ( 1.0 mg/mg to 0.67 mg/kg ) . If a subject experiences any adverse events after the second dose , but one that resolves within 8 hours , the dose will be reduced again by 33 % ( 0.67 mg/kg to 0.45 mg/kg ) . If this dose reduction protocol does not eliminate adverse events , then oral ketamine will be discontinued . In addition , subsequent subjects will receive a 33 % reduction in the Day 2 oral ketamine doses Day 3 ( second post-op day ) ( Tapering Down Period ) Subjects will receive oral ketamine at half of the previous day final dose ( 0.5 mg/kg if no dose reductions have occurred ) , 3 times a day . For example , if the subjects ' dose is already at 0.45 mg/kg from the previous day reductions , then the third day dose will be 0.23 mg/kg . The first dose will be administered at 6 AM . Even on the third day if there are adverse events after any dose , but one that resolves within 8 hours after that dose , we will continue to reduce the dose by 33 % . If this dose reduction protocol does not eliminate adverse events , then the subject will not receive any more ketamine . In addition , subsequent subjects will receive a 33 % reduction in the Day 3 oral ketamine doses . While in the hospital for 3 days , should breakthrough pain occur , all subjects will receive standard of care pain control medication . All subjects will be discharged according to standard discharge protocol . Anticipated Adverse Events If a subject experiences adverse events , subjects will be closely monitored every hour until the event resolves . Adverse event duration and resolution time will be recorded . If the adverse event resolves , the next scheduled dose will be reduced by 33 % . Each adverse event will be assessed by the Principal Investigator and a clinical relevance determination will be made .",2015-01-12,"February 24, 2021","Inclusion Criteria : Adults of at least 18 years of age , but not older than 80 years Due to undergo elective major amputation of the lower extremity ( above the knee amputation ( AKA ) , below the knee amputation ( BKA ) , total knee amputation ( TKA ) , transmetatarsal amputation ( TMA ) , toe amputation ) from all causes .

The estimated direct and indirect cost of HF in the United States ( U.S. ) for 2006 was ~ $ 29.6 billion . Despite the significant resources expended on the treatment of this disease , outcomes remain poor . The five-year survival for individuals diagnosed with HF is less than 50 % , and in end-stage HF , the one-year survival may be as low as 25 % regardless of medical therapy . Recent studies suggest that the failing heart is not refractory to treatment , as was previously believed . For example , the observation that a small percentage of subjects with left ventricular assist devices can be permanently weaned from their device strongly suggests that damaged hearts are capable of recovering lost function . Celladon Corporation ( Celladon ) is investigating gene transfer as a method to restore calcium ion ( Ca++ ) cycling in HF patients . The gene therapy vehicle uses a recombinant adeno-associated viral vector ( AAV ) , which consists of an AAV serotype 1 capsid and contains the human sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca++ ATPAse ( SERCA2a ) complementary DNA ( cDNA ) flanked by inverted terminal repeats derived from AAV serotype 2 ( AAV1/SERCA2a ) . MYDICAR® refers to AAV1/SERCA2a drug product intended for administration by percutaneous delivery . Phase 1/2 clinical trials have demonstrated initial safety and evidence of improvement in clinical outcomes at MYDICAR doses of up to 1 x 10^13 DNase-resistant particles ( DRP ) . The trial described here is designed to investigate the safety profile and preliminary activity of MYDICAR at a dose of 2.5 x 10^13 DRP ; this dose is 2.5-fold higher than previously investigated doses .",2015-01-15,"January 30, 2017","Inclusion Criteria : Unless otherwise specified , screening must be performed within 30 days prior to enrollment ( phase 1 ) or enrollment/randomization ( phase 2 ) except as noted below .

Azienda USL Modena,NCT02349945,FSH Receptor Polymorphism p.N680S and Efficacy of FSH Therapy,Azienda USL Modena,2,1,Male Infertility,Drug,follitropin alpha,Treatment,Single,"CONDITION : Idiopathic male infertility In men with idiopathic infertility , the sperm DNA fragmentation index ( DFI ) within 12 weeks of FSH therapy and 12 weeks follow-up improves depending on the FSHR genotype as assessed by the non-synonymous SNP rs6166 ( wild type or p.N680S ) . This is a phase II b , multicenter , prospective , open label , one arm , clinical trial stratified according to the patient 's genotype . INTERVENTION : FSH therapy ( 150 I.U . sc every other day for 12 weeks ) in infertile men who are homozygous for the wild-type FSHR or the p.N680S allele of the FSHR . Duration of intervention per patient : 12 weeks Primary efficacy endpoint : Sperm DFI . Number of patients with an improvement in DFI > 60 % Key secondary endpoint ( s ) : pregnancy , semen parameters , serum levels of inhibin B and AMH .","Male factor infertility is responsible for about 50 % of cases of involuntary couple infertility and remains idiopathic in about half of the cases . At present , there are no consistently effective treatments for male idiopathic infertility . Since follicle-stimulating hormone ( FSH ) is fundamental for spermatogenesis , recombinant hFSH is empirically used for male infertility treatment . The response to FSH , however , is highly variable and while sperm parameters improve in some patients , about 50 % of the subjects do not clearly respond to FSH . Several studies were performed in the past and a recent Cochrane meta-analysis showed that FSH treatment of male idiopathic infertility overall significantly improves pregnancy rate . Nevertheless , no predictive marker of response to FSH , allowing a stratified therapeutic approach , was identified so far . The sperm DNA fragmentation index ( DFI ) provides an estimation of genetic integrity of spermatozoa and was shown to improve significantly after FSH treatment . Therefore , DFI could be used as a pharmacodynamic marker of FSH in the male . In women , the response to FSH varies depending on the FSH receptor ( FSHR ) genotype , as determined by the non-synonymous SNP rs6166 , which exchanges the amino acid Asn to Ser in codon 680 . This SNP is very common , with a minor allele frequency of 0.4 . Women homozygous for Ser at amino acid position 680 of the FSHR are less sensitive to endogenous and exogenous FSH compared to those homozygous for Asn and require more FSH for multiple follicular growth and maturation in assisted reproduction . The investigators hypothesize that the variable response to FSH in unselected infertile men is due to a different individual sensitivity to FSH as determined by the common FSHR polymorphism rs6166 . In particular the investigators will test the hypothesis that men homozygous for Asn at 680 ( wild type ) will respond better to exogenous FSH treatment in terms of sperm DFI compared to men homozygous for Ser , assessing sperm DFI as pharmacodynamic parameter of FSH . Men with idiopathic infertility and normal serum FSH levels , candidate for treatment with FSH , will be recruited . Men with a sperm DFI > 15 % will be included in the trial if carriers of the homozygous Asn/Asn or Ser/Ser at aminoacid position 680 . The FSHR genotype will be assessed centrally and the physician will only receive the information whether the patient is eligible for entering the trial ( i.e . homozygous ) but both the physician and the patient will remain blind to the genotype . Human recombinant FSH ( Gonal-f , Merck Serono ) will be self-administered sc at the dose of 150 IU every other day for 12 weeks , followed by 12 weeks of observation ( follow up ) . Changes in sperm DFI will be the primary end point and compared between the two arms . In addition , the effects on pregnancy rate and other clinical and hormonal parameters will be evaluated . Should this pilot , proof-of-principle trial demonstrate that the response to FSH in male idiopathic infertility depends on FSHR genotype , larger interventional trials aiming at assessing the effects on pregnancy rate will be justified .",2015-01-16,"July 11, 2016","Inclusion Criteria : age 20-50 years idiopathic male factor infertility for at least one year ; homozygous FSHR allele at codon 680 ( wild type : Asn/Asn or Ser/Ser ) ; sperm DFI > 15 % ; normal serum FSH levels ( < 8 IU/L ) normal serum LH , testosterone , prolactin and estradiol levels normal ovulatory female partner These men might have impaired ejaculate parameters ( decreased sperm count and/or decreased proportion of sperm with progressive motility and/or decreased proportion of sperm with normal morphology ) of unknown aetiology .

The standard of care at most institutions is to leave the tonsillectomy wound bed exposed to heal on its own over one to two weeks . At many institutions , surgeons inject or topically apply local anesthetics such as bupivacaine hydrochloride to the tonsillectomy wound bed to help reduce post-operative pain . At other institutions , surgeons apply a layer of fibrin sealant , which is derived from the proteins that help form blood clots in blood , to the tonsillectomy wound bed in order to cover the site and reduce irritation and exposure of the wound bed . Use of fibrin sealant has the additional benefit of potentially reducing postoperative bleeding ( hemorrhage ) rates .

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of infusing bupivacaine anesthetic into the fibrin sealant prior to application to the tonsillectomy wound bed .

In this way , the combined product would function as a sort of `` medicated bandaid '' covering the painful wound bed and slowly delivering an entirely safe total dose of bupivacaine into the wound bed to reduce post-operative pain . The hypothesis of this study is that the application of the bupivacaine-infused fibrin sealant will 1 ) reduce post-operative mean pain scores in children undergoing tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy using a validated pediatric pain scoring system , 2 ) reduce post-operative hemorrhage rates , 3 ) reduce post-operative vomiting , 4 ) reduce total doses of post-operative pain medication and narcotic pain medication required , and 5 ) expedite recovery as determined by return to normal diet and activity level . The questions specific for this study include : 1 ) Does bupivacaine-infused fibrin sealant significantly reduce mean postoperative pain scores compared to fibrin sealant alone and compared to leaving the wound bed open to heal ? , 2 ) Does bupivacaine-infused fibrin sealant significantly reduce mean postoperative tonsil hemorrhage rates compared to fibrin sealant alone and compared to leaving the wound bed open to heal ? 3 ) Do children receiving bupivacaine-infused fibrin sealant require less pain medication compared to fibrin sealant alone or to leaving the wound bed open to heal ? , 4 ) Do children receiving bupivacaine-infused fibrin sealant return to normal diet and normal activity sooner compared to fibrin sealant alone or to leaving the wound bed open to heal ? , 5 ) Do the parents of children receiving bupivacaine-infused fibrin sealant make less calls to the clinic or the physician on call compared to fibrin sealant alone or to leaving the wound bed open to heal ? After discussion of the risks and benefits of performing tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy per routine , parents will be offered ( if child meets inclusion criteria elaborated below ) to participate in this research study . This discussion will take place either during the clinic encounter when the patient is signed up for their surgical procedure or on the day of surgery . The Informed Consent Statement will be reviewed with the parent/patient and either the surgical staff , resident investigators , or clinic nursing personnel included in the IRB proposal will be the individuals performing the discussion with the parents . If parents are agreeable to participating in the study and all questions have been asked and no exclusion criteria met , then the child will be enrolled . The child will be randomized to one of the three treatment arms elaborated in this application . Randomization arms include either : 1 ) leave wound bed open to heal , 2 ) application of unaltered fibrin sealant , and 3 ) application of bupivicaine-induced fibrin sealant . Children will undergo tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy per routine , but at the conclusion of the surgical procedure will have either of the 3 treatment options performed as above . For some children who have clinical concern for sleep disordered breathing or obstructive sleep apnea on a sleep study , the surgical procedure may also involve a direct laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy performed prior to tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy . During the laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy , the airway from the level of the mouth to the branches of the windpipe into each lung are inspected with small rigid cameras ( endoscopes ) ; if floppiness/collapse ( laryngomalacia ) of the supraglottis ( tissue above the vocal cords ) is observed , the child will undergo a laser supraglottoplasty to remove the floppy tissue and relieve the obstruction . If a child has laryngomalacia and supraglottoplasty is performed , the child will then be excluded from the study . Exclusion at this time is based on the creation of an additional wound bed in the throat which could weaken our ability to determine if application of fibrin sealant or bupivacaine-infused fibrin sealant is effective . If during direct laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy , no laryngomalacia is observed and no supraglottoplasty is performed , then the child will continue into the treatment arm into which they were randomized . After inclusion , randomization , and proceeding with treatment based on the study arm to which the child was randomize , all parents/participants will received standardized post-operative discharge instructions with regard to pain medicine regimens and diet as well as an envelope containing pain assessment questionnaires to be completed 3 times daily for 10 days as a means of documenting pain scores among other data points . The parents will receive a pre-addressed , pre-stamped envelop to facilitate return of their data to the researchers . Currently our clinic nurses call the family of patients approximately 2-3 weeks after surgery to inquire as to how the child is doing and to ensure that if the family desires a follow up appointment that one will be made . Parents of children included in this study will receive a similar phone call during the same approximate time frame either by the clinic nurses or by the surgical staff or resident investigators , but additional specific questions regarding post-operative bleeding and pain control will be documented for research purposes . Additionally , during this phone call , parents will be reminded to complete and return their post-operative pain assessment sheets in the provided pre-addressed , pre-stamped envelopes they received on the day of surgery .",2015-01-15,"August 4, 2018","Inclusion Criteria : 1 .

Based on recent studies , pyridostigmine may be an effective adjuvant treatment for people with Pompe disease , as it increases the functional impact of this neurotransmitter . Hypothesis : the use of pyridostigmine in Pompe disease will improve transmission of acetylcholine across the neuromuscular junction , skeletal muscle function , respiratory function , and quality of life .","Pompe is a rare disease , which occurs in approximately 1 per 40,000 births . It is a progressive and often fatal neuromuscular disorder resulting from mutation in the gene for acid alpha-glucosidase ( GAA ) , an enzyme necessary to degrade glycogen . Accumulation of glycogen in multiple tissues results in cardiac , respiratory and skeletal muscle dysfunction . Enzyme replacement therapy ( ERT ) is currently the only treatment available , and although it prolongs survival , adjuvant therapies are needed to help alleviate the dire symptoms of Pompe disease . Recent data has revealed that degradation of the neuromuscular junction ( NMJ ) occurs in Pompe disease . Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors ( AChEI ) are substances that inhibit the AChE enzyme from degrading acetylcholine at the NMJ , and thus increase the functional impact of this neurotransmitter . AChEI are established as a beneficial therapy for individuals with primary diseases of the NMJ , such as myasthenia gravis . Recently , administration of an AChEI was demonstrated to improve NMJ pathology in both mice and individuals affected by other congenital myopathies , including autosomal centronuclear myopathies ( CNM ) , X-linked myotubular myopathy ( XLMTM ) and mutation of tropomyosin 3 ( TPM3 ) . Specifically , both NMJ transmission and motor function were improved . These studies demonstrate that AChEI can be beneficial in myopathy associated with NMJ pathology . In this study , we will study the acute effects of pyridostigmine on neuromuscular transmission , as well as the prolonged effects on respiratory function , skeletal muscle function and quality of life over a 90 day treatment period . This project focuses on developing an adjuvant treatment to ERT that targets dysfunction at the NMJ .

"University of Maryland, Baltimore",NCT02354703,Pharmacogenetic Study of Ondansetron in Alcohol Use Disorder,"University of Maryland, Baltimore",2,1,Alcohol Use Disorder,Drug,Ondansetron,Treatment,Quadruple,The primary study objective is to determine the efficacy of ondansetron ( 0.33 mg twice daily ) administered orally for a period of 16 weeks in reducing risky drinking among currently drinking subjects with alcohol use disorder who have selected genotypes at the serotonin transporter and receptor genes . The secondary objective is to assess the safety and tolerability of ondansetron in subjects with alcohol use disorder who have selected genotypes at the serotonin transporter and receptor genes .,"Alcohol use disorder ( AUD ) is a heterogeneous and chronic relapsing disorder that includes both acute ( binge drinking ) and chronic ( frequent heavy drinking ) dimensions . Perhaps because of this heterogeneity , the therapeutic effect size of the approved medicines for the treatment of AUD has been small . In an effort to overcome the heterogeneity of response to a particular medication , recent studies have instituted a personalized approach to therapy . Major breakthroughs in pharmacogenetics have made it possible to identify discrete subgroups of the AUD population according to genetic profiles in order to target the subjects who are most likely to respond to treatment with a particular agent . In addition , genetic variation contributing to the risk of alcohol dependence may be differentially associated with treatment response Thus a successful personalized medicinal approach should ensure that targeted subgroups achieve an optimal treatment response with high predictability . Such an approach holds the potential to identify not only robust responders to treatment but also those who might have minimal or modest adverse effects from the putative therapeutic medication . From a practical clinical standpoint , a personalized medicine approach starts with a genetic screen to identify the `` right '' subject , who can then be treated with the appropriate medication , with a high probability of a positive treatment outcome and , therefore , a substantial impact on public health .",2015-01-23,"December 16, 2021","Inclusion Criteria : Men and women who have given written informed consent Aged 18 to 70 The subject has a breath alcohol concentration ( BrAC ) = 0.00 % at the screening visit and or = 9 will be evaluated by the PI or designee to determine eligibility .

University of Pittsburgh,NCT02355743,rtPA in in the Prevention of CVAD-Associated Thrombosis and Infection in Pediatric Patients With Short Bowel Syndrome,Lynn Malec,4,1,Short Bowel Syndrome,Drug,rtPA lock therapy,Prevention,,"The primary research question is , in patients with short bowel syndrome requiring central venous access device ( CVAD ) for long-term total parenteral nutrition , is once weekly recombinant tissue plasminogen activator ( rtPA ) lock therapy more effective than routine care using heparin flushes in reducing the incidence of line-associated thrombosis and infection .","Central venous access devices ( CVAD ) are used routinely in chronically ill pediatric patients for administration of medications , parenteral nutrition and laboratory testing . Several complications resulting from the use of long-term CVADs , namely venous sepsis and thrombosis , can significantly increase associated morbidity and mortality . CVAD-associated thrombosis occurs in up to 50 % of children with long-term CVAD use and this is especially common in patients requiring life-sustaining long-term total parenteral nutrition ( 1 ) . Catheter thrombosis may arise from fibrin sheath formation around the catheter tip , intraluminal blood clot within the catheter , or venous thrombosis obstructing the vein and occluding the catheter tip . Within 24 hours and typically within 2 weeks of placement of a CVAD , a fibrin sheath forms around its tip ( 2-5 ) . Development of intraluminal thrombosis or venous thrombosis is less predictable . There is a growing body of evidence linking the development of CVAD-associated thrombosis and line-related infection . It is known that proteins within the thrombus including fibronectin and fibrinogen attract bacteria , specifically staphylococcal species .

Then , the drug will be stopped for two months for observation of change of proteinuria .","Immunoglobulin A ( IgA ) nephropathy is the most common type of primary glomerulonephritis worldwide . Several studies indicated that 6-43 % of IgA nephropathy patients would develop end-stage kidney disease ( ESKD ) over a period of 10 years . The clinical risk factors for progression are hypertension , protienuria , impaired renal function and histologic lesions at presentation . There is no well accepted optimal therapy for patients with IgA . Current established therapies include full RAS inhibition and optimal blood pressure control for patients with proteinuria and/or hypertension . Hydroxychloroquine has been used for many years to treat malaria . It is also used to treat systemic lupus erythematosus , rheumatic disorders like rheumatoid arthritis and Sjögren 's Syndrome . Recently , several studies found that Hydroxychloroquine could reduce the risk of ESRD in patients with lupus nephrits . The mechanism of the treatment was n't well known so far . Some investigators found that Hydroxychloroquine increases lysosomal pH in antigen presenting cells . In inflammatory conditions , it blocks toll-like receptors on plasmacytoid dendritic cells ( PDCs ) . Toll-like receptor 9 ( TLR 9 ) , which recognizes DNA-containing immune complexes , leads to the production of interferon and causes the dendritic cells to mature and present antigen to T cells . Hydroxychloroquine , by decreasing TLR signaling , reduces the activation of dendritic cells and the inflammatory process . The pathogenesis of IgA nephropathy included the deposition of immune complex containing IgA in mesangium and causing local immune activation and injury to kidney .

Maimonides Medical Center,NCT02388321,Pediatric Ketamine Study for Pain Management,Antonios Likourezos,4,0,Pain,Drug,Ketamine,Treatment,Quadruple,Direct comparison of intranasal sub-dissociative dose ketamine with intranasal fentanyl for the treatment of moderate to severe pain in pediatric patients in the emergency department .,"Intranasal ( IN ) delivery of analgesic agents provides rapid and convenient drug administration without the need for needles . In children , the placement of an intravenous line often increases anxiety and pain , requires nursing time , and can be very difficult to achieve , so the IN route is particularly advantageous . IN delivery of fentanyl has become increasingly more common in pain management for children in many settings , including pre-hospital and emergency department ( ED ) settings . Over the past decade , many studies have demonstrated that intranasal fentanyl is as effective as intravenous morphine to treat acute moderate to severe pain . Intranasal fentanyl has become standard of care in some pediatric EDs with the advantage of avoiding intravenous line placement . However , adverse effects attributed to IN fentanyl are similar to those of other opioid analgesics : hypotension , sedation , and occasionally respiratory depression . Ketamine is a noncompetitive N-methyl D-aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor antagonist that blocks the release of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate and provides anesthesia , amnesia , and analgesia by decreasing central sensitization and `` wind-up '' phenomenon . Due to its high lipid solubility , ketamine rapidly crosses the blood-brain barrier , provides rapid onset of action ( peak concentration at 1 minute after intravenous push ) and rapid recovery to baseline ( duration of action 5-15 minutes after intravenous push ) . At sub-dissociative doses , either used as an adjunct to opioid analgesics or as a solo agent , ketamine provides effective analgesia while preserving airway patency , ventilation , and cardiovascular stability . Ketamine has been less studied for pain management , however it has been safely used via different routes of administration in children . Studies dating back to 1990 's use ketamine at doses as high as 6 mg/kg intranasally in children for pre-medication prior to surgery or for sedation with little or no reported adverse effects . A hospital in Australia is currently conducting a clinical trial comparing IN fentanyl 1.5 ug/kg to IN ketamine 1mg/kg for the treatment of pain caused by isolated musculoskeletal injury . The intention of our study is similar to this , however the investigators will not limit the patients to those with only musculoskeletal pain and a more simplified pain scale will be used . To assess pain , the investigators will use the standard pain scale that is currently used in our Pediatric ED in order to minimize the need to re-train any of our staff with a different pain scale . The scale incorporates the Numerical rating scale ( 0-10 scale ; NRS ) and the Wong-Baker faces pain scale ( 6 faces corresponding to 0,2,4,6,8,10 ; WBS ) . While prior studies have used different pain scales , primarily the visual analog scale ( VAS ) , the scales that the investigator currently use have been validated in children in 2009 .",2015-02-09,"May 7, 2018","Inclusion Criteria : Children aged 3-17 , weighing less than 50kg present to the pediatric ED with moderate-severe acute pain ( defined as pain greater than or equal to 6/10 ) .

University of Oxford,NCT02385513,PCV10 Immunogenicity Study Nepal 2015,University of Oxford,4,1,Streptococcus Pneumoniae,Biological,10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine,Prevention,,"A single centre open-label , parallel group , randomised controlled trial , recruiting healthy Nepalese infants aged 40-60 days , who present to the immunisation clinic at Patan Hospital , Kathmandu , Nepal , randomised to receive a 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ( PCV10 ) at either ; 6+10 weeks and 9 months OR 6+14 weeks and 9 months The study will enroll 152 healthy Nepalese infants in each treatment arm ( 304 in total ) . Demographic and clinical data will be collected on an electronic case report form to allow monitoring remotely . Participants will receive the study vaccine according to their allocated treatment arm in addition to their other routine vaccines . The investigators will collect 3 blood samples for analysis of serum antibody responses to the PCV10 vaccine serotypes throughout infancy ( see Table 1 ) . The data collected will be analysed in order to determine whether the 6+10 schedule is non-inferior to the 6+14 schedule in generating immune responses against the vaccine serotypes above the ≥0•35μg/mL threshold . These data will then be used to inform decision-making around augmenting the currently recommended 6+14 schedule to a 6+10 schedule in Nepal . The investigators will collect a nasopharyngeal swab at 2 time points to look at carriage of pneumococcus over time and to assess differences between the 2 groups . This is of critical importance because much of the programmatic impact of PCV is ultimately conferred by reductions in carriage at the community level and indirect effects resulting from that nasopharyngeal ( NP ) protection .","BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE Streptococcus pneumoniae is the predominant cause of bacterial pneumonia , meningitis and septicaemia in children worldwide , and disproportionately affects children from developing countries . Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines ( PCVs ) reduce pneumococcal disease burden by direct protection and by reducing nasopharyngeal carriage , thereby preventing transmission and inducing herd protection . In Nepal , invasive pneumococcal disease ( IPD ) is responsible for a substantial disease burden in children . Surveillance conducted since 2005 at Patan Hospital , Kathmandu indicates the majority of IPD is due to serotypes 1 , 5 and 14 , and that the greater proportion occurs in late infancy and toddlerhood.7 Vaccine introduction began in January 2015 with PCV10 . GAVI ( Gavi , The Vaccine Alliance ) has funded an impact assessment programme ( including IPD , pneumonia , nasopharyngeal ( NP ) colonization and health economics ) , which is underway . A randomised controlled trial conducted by investigators at Patan Hospital in collaboration with the Oxford Vaccine Group , using a 10-valent PCV , demonstrated a two-dose prime ( at 6 and 14 weeks ) and 9-month booster to have non-inferior immunogenicity at 18 weeks and 10 months and superior immunogenicity in early childhood ( 2-4 years of age ) compared to a conventional three-dose priming only schedule ( 6 , 10 , and 14 weeks ) . This two-dose prime and boost schedule , with an 8 week interval between the priming doses , has been adopted as an acceptable schedule by the World Health Organization ( WHO ) and recommended in late 2014 by the Nepal Ministry of Health as a result of the study . However the WHO have also recommended the introduction of a single inactivated poliomyelitis virus vaccine at 14-weeks of age in order to mitigate the risk of outbreaks from vaccine derived serotype 2 poliomyelitis virus , to protect against serotype 2 poliomyelitis virus once countries switch to bivalent OPV ( oral polio vaccine ) from trivalent OPV , and to enhance immunogenicity to poliomyelitis vaccine serotypes 1 and 3 . This has created a programmatic dilemma and concerns around vaccine coverage as a result of requiring three injections at the 14-week visit . Thus the Nepalese Ministry of Health , based on these concerns around public acceptance and feasibility have decided to move the second PCV10 priming dose from 14 weeks to 10 weeks of age . Given this decision it is essential to evaluate the immunogenicity of the intended schedule , comparing it to the schedule that has been shown to provide a level of immunogenicity that would predict substantial program impact on disease and colonisation . This importance is further increased given that the Nepal PCV10 impact study is currently underway and the limited data on two-dose priming schedules with a one-month interval between priming doses in other settings shows a reduction in immunogenicity . Therefore this study will be undertaken in order to evaluate the immunogenicity of the 10-valent PCV priming at 6 and 10 weeks being implemented by the Nepal Ministry of Health , compared to priming at 6 and 14 weeks of age in healthy Nepali infants . In both groups a PCV10 booster will be given at 9 months of age . Nepal Nepal is a low-income country in South Asia with a population of 25.8 million people and an estimated under 5 year mortality of 54/1000 live births . Access to health care varies considerably within the country , but as few as 18 % of children under 5 years with pneumonia are taken to health care facilities . The capital city , Kathmandu , resides in a large valley , which in 2011 had a total population of about 1,744,240 people , with approximately 10 % of these being children under 5 years of age . The majority of children in Nepal receive immunisation through local government outpatient clinics . The national Expanded Programme of Immunisation ( EPI ) schedule being followed in Nepal currently includes Bacillus Calmette-Guérin ( BCG ) at birth , diphtheria-tetanus-whole cell pertussis-hepatitis B-Haemophilus influenzae type b ( DTwP-HBV-Hib ) and oral Polio ( OPV ) vaccines at 6 , 10 and 14 weeks of age , IPV at 14 weeks of age , measles and rubella vaccine at 9 months of age , Japanese Encephalitis ( JE ) vaccine at 12-23 months of age ( in endemic regions only ; Kathmandu is one of these regions ) and tetanus toxoid during pregnancy . Vaccine coverage is high in Nepal with over 90 % of infants receiving DTP , by 14 weeks of age in the past 3 years . PCV10 vaccine at 6 and 10 weeks and a booster at 9 months of age was initiated in the new birth cohort only ( i.e . no catch up program is being instituted ) as of January 2015 with roll-out beginning in the west of the country and expected to reach the whole of the country by late 2015 . The Patan Academy of Health Sciences and Patan Hospital will lead this study in Nepal . Patan Hospital is one of only two hospitals in Kathmandu with paediatric referral and inpatient services and is based in Lalitpur , in the south of the City . Over 300 children commence immunisation at the 'Under 14 clinic ' in the Patan Hospital paediatric outpatient department each month . Pneumococcal Disease in Kathmandu On-going surveillance of IPD serotypes has been occurring at Patan Hospital in Kathmandu since 2005 , identifying all paediatric admission from whom pneumococcus is isolated from normally sterile body fluids . This programme was initially funded through PneumoADIP as part of the South Asia Pneumococcal Alliance ( SAPNA ) with extensive collection of clinical , radiological and laboratory data , demonstrating pneumococcus to be a significant cause of disease in children in Kathmandu , and is currently funded by the World Health Organisation . Analysis of these data up until late 2012 , show a predominance of non-vaccine serotypes in early infancy , followed by a shift towards vaccine serotypes , particularly serotype 1 , in late infancy and into childhood . The finding of serotypes 1 , 5 and , 14 to be the most frequent disease causing isolates is in keeping with data summarized in the Global Serotype Project which demonstrated serotype disease order of frequency in low-income countries was 14 , 5 , 1 , 6B , 19F , 23F and 6A . The age distribution of vaccine type disease reinforces the importance of initiating vaccine coverage early in infancy such that early boosting at 9 months may be performed to maintain coverage into early childhood . Immunogenicity of PCV10 in Kathmandu We previously conducted an open-label , parallel group , randomised controlled trial at Patan Hospital , Kathmandu , Nepal from June 2010 to November 2011 with follow-on between February and October 2013 . In this study we compared the then WHO recommended PCV schedule of three priming doses in early infancy ( 6 , 10 , and 14 weeks ) to a two-dose prime ( 6 and 14 weeks ) and boost at 9 months of age . We demonstrated using the ten-valent PCV ( PCV10 ) that the two-dose prime with booster at 9 months provided analogous immunogenicity to the three-dose prime schedule during early infancy , with improved protection through early childhood . Global Polio Eradication Initiative Over the last decade the oral poliomyelitis vaccine ( OPV ) has been extremely efficacious in preventing wild-type polio disease across the world , including Nepal . The OPV used in the routine vaccine schedule contains three serotypes of weakened poliomyelitis virus ( types 1 , 2 and 3 ) , and has facilitated the eradication of wild-type poliomyelitis in Nepal . On very rare occasions disease may occur as a result of circulating vaccine derived polio viruses ( cVDPV ) , particularly of serotype 2 . Thus , in countries such as Nepal , there is the situation where wild-type disease has been eradicated yet there remains a rare risk of vaccine derived disease outbreaks . This had led to the proposal to switch to a bivalent OPV ( types 1 and 3 ) , globally . This can not happen however , unless populations are protected from type 2 disease through some other means . Furthermore the inactivated poliomyelitis vaccine ( IPV ) , which is administered as an intramuscular injection , generates immunity using killed strains of the three poliomyelitis serotypes , and thus does not produce vaccine type disease or result in the emergence of cVDPV outbreaks . This has led the WHO to recommend the introduction of IPV in order to interrupt and mitigate the risk of cVDPV type 2 disease , prior to the phasing in of the bivalent OPV and cessation of OPV-type 2 use . In Nepal a single dose of the IPV at 14 weeks of age in addition to the routine schedule of trivalent OPV , has now been implemented ( September 2014 ) . Nepal was the first GAVI ( Gavi The Vaccine Alliance ) country to introduce IPV , and is ready to participate in the globally synchronized switch to bivalent OPV that will be coordinated by WHO in 2016 . IPV is given at 14 weeks of age ; the proposed PCV10 schedule of 6 weeks , 14 weeks , and 9 months of age meant that children would receive three injections at 14 weeks of age ( IPV , PCV10 and dose 3 of DTwP-HBV-Hib vaccine ) . The perception by the health care providers and the Ministry of Health is that this will not be acceptable and will lead to reduced vaccine coverage . Therefore the Nepal Ministry of Health has introduced in January 2015 PCV10 on a schedule of 6 weeks , 10 weeks , and 9 months of age . Based on locally available IPD data and a prior immunogenicity study in Kathmandu , pneumococcal conjugate vaccination utilising PCV10 with two priming doses at 6 and 14 weeks followed by a 9-month booster has been demonstrated to be the WHO preferred schedule in comparison to a three-dose prime only schedule . However the WHO have also recommended the introduction of a single dose of IPV at 14 weeks of age in order to eradicate poliomyelitis serotype 2 vaccine strain disease . Local experts anticipate a poor uptake of vaccine at 14 weeks of age due to the increase in number of injections from one to three at this time-point . The Nepali government has thus suggested moving the 14 weeks PCV10 priming dose to the earlier 10 week time-point , however there are no immunogenicity data to support this decision . Therefore this study will aim to compare the immunogenicity of giving the two PCV10 priming doses at 6 and 10 weeks to that of 6 and 14 weeks . In addition this study will also evaluate the adverse event profile following the 14 weeks of age visit in the two treatment arms .",2015-03-05,"January 9, 2018","Inclusion Criteria : Male or Female , aged 40-60 days at time of first study vaccination Parent/ guardian of participant is willing and able to give informed consent for participation in the study .

Sir Mortimer B. Davis - Jewish General Hospital,NCT02385500,Fesoterodine on Urgency Episodes in Parkinson's Disease Population,Sir Mortimer B. Davis - Jewish General Hospital,4,0,"Urinary Bladder, Overactive",Drug,Fesoterodine,Treatment,Double,"Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) causes several non-motor autonomic symptoms including lower urinary tract dysfunction . Their symptoms can be managed with antimuscarinics with variable efficacy . Fesoterodine offers a new therapeutic molecule to target the symptoms of urinary frequency , urgency and nocturia in this patient population . The purpose of this protocol is to compare the impact of fesoterodine to placebo on urinary urgency and nocturnal sleep problems in a heterogeneous population of PD patients in a cross-over fashion . A representative number of patients with baseline overactive bladder ( OAB ) symptoms and Parkinson 's disease will be recruited to receive either the active drug or placebo for the first phase of eight weeks . The groups will then be crossed-over during the second phase of eight weeks . The main outcomes assessed will be the urgency episodes on a 3-day voiding diary , as well as the nocturnal sleep problems will be the Parkinson 's Disease Sleep Scale ( PDSS ) .","Study purpose and rationale : Patients with Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) commonly develop lower urinary tract symptoms as their disease severity progresses . The most frequent symptoms are nocturia ( night time urinary frequency ) , urinary frequency and urgency . ( 1 ) The effects on voiding function of levodopa and dopamine agonists for the treatment of motor symptoms in patients with PD are not clearly understood because studies conclude conflicting results . ( 2 ) Their overactive bladder ( OAB ) symptoms are primarily managed with antimuscarinics with variable efficacy , and there is concern for possible heightened central side-effects such as cognitive or motor deterioration in this patient population . ( 3 , 4 ) Current standard of care for PD patients with lower urinary tract symptoms requires a full evaluation with history and physical exam . This is followed by a microscopic urinalysis , a 3-day bladder diary along with several questionnaires . According to their symptoms , some patients may require a non-invasive uroflowmetry and assessment of post void residual , while others will undergo a full urodynamic studies . Management of their voiding symptoms will require initial conservative measures and behavioral modifications ( reducing caffeinated drinks and smoking cessation , optimizing fluid intake , weight loss ) and bladder training . If this fails to improve their symptoms , oral pharmacotherapy will be offered with antimuscarinics or beta-3 agonists . The purpose of this protocol is to compare the impact of fesoterodine to placebo on urinary urgency and nocturnal sleep problems in a heterogeneous population of PD patients in a cross-over fashion . Although OAB can be effectively treated , there is compelling and scientifically sound methodological reasons for its use as participants in the study will not face additional risks of serious or irreversible harm from exposure to placebo . Placebo controlled trials are the most rigorous test of treatment efficacy for evaluating a medical therapy and will require fewer subjects than active control trials . Lastly , anticholinergic studies have shown to have a very large placebo effect and are only partially effective in treating voiding symptoms , which justifies the use of a placebo arm . Sample size : This is an initial pilot study to identify the effect size of fesoterodine treatment on urgency episodes in patients with PD . Subjects will be randomized in both groups by stratifying them according to their age group ( younger or older than 75 years-old ) and gender . Power analysis and sample size calculation are not relevant in this study given its exploratory nature . The investigators expect to recruit a total of 60 patients to complete the cross-over study for analysis purposes . This number is based on similar design studies , particularly one by Wagg et al . looking at the effects of solifenacin and oxybutynin in older adults with mild cognitive impairment ( 6 ) . Many other similar studies with groups of subjects varying between 40 and 77 have demonstrated efficacy differences of anticholinergics in a cross-over fashion ( 7-9 ) . Design and description of methodology : This randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , crossover , parallel-group study will be carried out in an outpatient clinic . Subjects are assessed and included in the study if they are willing to participate and fit the criteria at Visit 0 . They are then randomized to group A or B and undergo a baseline evaluation . Both groups undergo a two-week washout period during which they are given placebo . Group A subjects will be started on fesoterodine 4 mg once a day in the morning after the two-week washout period . They will have the option to escalate to 8 mg ( 2 tablets of 4 mg each ) after 4 weeks on fesoterodine . Patients will have the option to go back to one tablet ( i.e. , 4 mg ) at any time in the study . At 10 weeks ( 2 weeks washout and 8 weeks of study tablets ) , subjects are assessed in the clinic ( Visit 1 ) . Group B subjects will be started on placebo tablets , similar to fesoterodine 4 mg , and will have the option to escalate as well . All subjects then have a 2-week washout period . After the washout period , subjects will be crossed over to the opposite arm in which the same patterns of outcome assessment and dose titration were maintained . The study will conclude at 20 weeks . At the end of 20 weeks ( Visit 2 ) , the investigators ' subjects will be interviewed about any side effects , vital signs will be examined , adverse reactions or events monitored , and outcome measures will be documented . Throughout the study , the subjects will be able to drop out anytime with instructions to inform us of their decision and about any adverse effects . Overall , each subject will have 3 clinical visits after enrollment in the study . Data analysis plan : The comparison between the 2 arms of the study , the group that initially received fesoterodine with the one that received placebo , will be conducted using chi-square analysis . A 2-sample t test will be used to compare baseline scores between the 2 groups . The Wilcoxon rank-sum test will be used to calculate whether the mean difference of all the outcome measures between treatment and placebo periods is significant . Differences between placebo and treatments will be adjusted by baseline measures ( where available and a 1-sample sign rank tested that the mean difference equated to 0 ) . Any difference will be analyzed as a change from the baseline . The primary outcome measure will be the number of urgency episodes , with a P value less than .05 considered statistically significant . The present statistical analysis of secondary measures encompasses a number of formal comparisons , and thus a group-wise type I error could occur . Recruitment procedures : Study investigators will send a letter to colleagues asking for referrals of eligible patients interested in the study . The study investigators may provide the referring physicians an information sheet about the study to give to the patients . If interested , the patient will contact the investigator . Or , with documented permission from the patient ( e.g. , note in medical record indicates primary care provider spoke with patient who agreed to be contacted ) , the investigaor may be allowed to contact patients about enrollment . Clinics maintain a separate CHR-approved recruitment protocol that asks patients if they will agree ahead of time to be contacted for research . Investigators contact patients about the study in accord with their signed consent . The investigators will consider recruitment when patients with PD present to their clinic with urination symptoms . They will be presented with the option and if they agree , they will then be assessed for inclusion . The investigators will be blinded to the treatment group . Details on confidentiality : All data will remain confidential and will be available for access by the investigators only . All records will be identified with a unique identifier , corresponding to the subjects , to maintain confidentiality . Records will be kept in one safe and locked location , and electronic records will be password protected . The study information will be kept for duration of 25 years . As this is an investigator-initiated trial , Pfizer Canada 's role is restricted to providing the medications and placebo , as well as the budget required to do the study . They have approved the current protocol , and will not be involved in further decision-making or data analysis . There are no other potential conflicts of interest .

Mando Group AB,NCT02381327,Reduction of the Speed of Eating as an Intervention in Obesity,Mando Group AB,1,1,Binge-Eating Disorder,Device,Mandometer,Treatment,,"Patients diagnosed with Binge Eating Disorder ( BED ) overeat food but , as opposed to patients with bulimia nervosa , they do not compensate for their increased food intake and therefore their body weight increases . It is hypothesized that the speed of eating has increased in BED and that body weight will decrease if the speed of eating is decreased . The speed of eating is measured using Mandometer , an eating disorder conditioning tool , class 2 device cleared by the FDA for the treatment of eating disorders . Mandometer is a scale connected to a computer , patients eat food from a plate on the scale and the computer stores the weight loss of the plate , thus recording the speed of eating . Patients decrease their speed of eating by following training curves on the computer screen while eating . The emergence of their own speed of eating on the screen makes this possible . Patients use Mandometer for lunch and dinner over one week at home to estimate their speed of eating and their food intake as the first step of clinical pratice . Mandometer is then programmed with how much and how quickly to eat and patients practice eating using Mandometer at home over the subsequent treatment . Data from 166 BED-patients using Mandometer at home and from a total of 354 patients who have been treated have been collected . 30 normal weight , healthy subjects will be recruited to test the hypothesis that their speed of eating is lower than that of the BED-patients . These control subjects will eat lunch and dinner using Mandometer at home over one week , but they will , obviously , not participate in treatment .","Background : control of the speed of eating and the amount of food eaten is a major intervention in Mandometer treatment of anorexia nervosa ( AN ) , bulimia nervosa ( BN ) , and eating disorders not otherwise specified ( EDNOS ) , including binge eating disorder ( BED ) , which is an EDNOS . The control is achieved by Mandometer , which is a scale connected to a computer . The patient eats food from a plate on the scale and the computer records the weight loss of the plate over the course of the meal . Thus , the amount of food eaten and the duration of the meal are measured . This yields a measure of the speed of eating . Patients also estimate their feeling of fullness at regular intervals on a scale on the Mandometer computer screen and the computer stores the ratings . Thus , the development of satiety is also measured . AN-patients eat only little food over a long period of time . They practice eating more food at a higher speed by following training curves on the computer screen while eating . This is possible because the patients can see their own speed of eating emerging on the screen while eating and so they can adjust their speed of eating to the training curves . The patients learn to feel full in a normal manner by practicing in the same way , assisted by feedback from the Mandometer computer screen . Mandometer treatment of AN and BN has been evaluted in a randomized controlled trial , outcome of treatment of 1428 patients with eating disorders in six clinics in four countries has been reported , and the treatment has been reported to be more effective than a standard treatment in reducing body weight and improving health in obese adolescents in a randomized controlled trial . Mandometer has been cleared as an eating disorder conditioning tool , class 2 device by the FDA for the treatment of eating disorders . Hypotheses : it is hypothesized that BED-patients eat more food at a higher speed than normal weight , healthy people . Because they do not compensate for their increased intake of food , BED-patients gain weight and become obese . It is also hypothesized that BED-patients will lose weight by practicing eating less food at a reduced speed using Mandometer . Aims of trial : 166 BED-patients have practiced eating less food at a reduced speed at home over one week and a total of 354 BED-patients ( including the 166 patients ) have practiced eating in the same manner in Mandometer treatment of eating disorders . This trial aims at testing the hypothesis that BED-patients eat at a higher speed than normal weight , healthy control subjects . The trial also aims at examining whether BED-patients lose weight by practicing eating less food at a reduced speed . Normal weight , healthy control subjects will be recruited and tested for food intake and speed of eating at home over one week to meet these aims . Patient admission and treatment : patients are continuously admitted to Mandometer treatment , which is a standard of care for eating disorders since 1997 in the Stockholm City Council . Hence , patients are treated according to the clinical practice of the Mandometer Clinic . 20 % of the patients are admitted through referral within the Swedish Health Care System and 80 % through self-referral , which is an option within the system . 85 % of the 354 patients are women , their age and BMI were similar to those of men , their mean ( SD ) age at admission was 38 ( 15.4 ) years and their BMI was 37.1 ( 7.5 ) kg/m2 , for women and men combined . The marked sex difference is expected , most patients with eating disorders are women . The patients first come to the clinic for instruction on how to use Mandometer at home and they return after one week for an eating examination . While eating at home over the first week using Mandometer is now part of clinical practice , this was not the case when Mandometer treatment for BED was launched . Thus , the first 354-166=188 patients who were admitted to Mandometer treatment did not eat using Mandometer at home before they entered treatment . Instead , these patients ate using Mandometer as part of the initial examination at admission . At that examination , which is referred to as an eating examination , all patients fill in the the Eating Disorders Inventory , the Comprehensive Psychopathological Self-Rating Scale , and questionnaires of the quality of life . As part of the eating examination , the patients are also examined by a physician , including blood pressure , heart and lung examination , and palpation of the stomach , and they are interviewed concerning their medical history and history of eating disorders . The patients´ body weight and composition are examined ( Tanita BC-418 MA ) and a record of their recent 24-hour food intake and eating habits is also taken . They are then diagnosed with BED using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders . Intervention : the patients are instructed in the use of Mandometer at their first visit to the clinic and they are given a Mandometer for use at home over the following week . They are encouraged to eat the foods they normally eat for lunch and dinner on five days of the week . 75 % of the 166 patients had up to six meals with Mandometer in these tests . The average amount of food and the time to eat thus collected on Mandometer are loaded onto Mandobase , a custom made database used in the clinical practice of the Mandometer Clinic . The data are used to program Mandometer with training curves for the control of eating behavior , i.e. , amount of food eaten and duration of the meal . The aim of Mandometer training is that patients should eat about 300-350 g of food for both lunch and dinner at a speed of about 25-30 g/min . These values correspond to those of previously tested normal weight , healthy control subjects , who ate using Mandometer in a research laboratory , but never at home . Patients are also provided with a schedule for 24-hour food intake , in which regularity of eating is stressed and between meal snacking is discouraged . Patients return to the Mandometer Clinic every sixth week for measuring their body weight and their eating behavior using Mandometer without training curves . The 188 patients who did not use Mandometer at home had their training curves similarly prepared but based on one test with Mandometer only , which was administered as part of their eating examination when they were admitted to the clinic . The patients are treated as out-patients , they come once/week over the first eight weeks and then once/second week . The average number of visits to the clinic is 30 over about a year . Quality assurance plan : trained clinicians enter data from Mandometer into Mandobase . Mandometer yields quantitative , valid data , e.g. , amount of food eaten ( g ) and duration of meal ( min ) . These data can be accessed by researchers and clinicians who get log in information after they qualified for using Mandometer . Staff are trained at Mando Academy and certified before they can treat eating disorder patients . Mandometer Clinics are ISO 9001 and 14001 certified at regular audits . Data checks : the data are not checked against data in other registers . Source data verification : because Mandometer data are quantitative and valid , they are not in need of external verification . Speed of eating among obese subjects has been examined before , but using questionnaires rather than quantitative methods . Data Dictionary : all measures are standard metrics , e.g. , kg , g , min . Standard Operating Procedures : Mandobase is designed for ease of data entry and data collection . Data in Mandobase is easily exported to standard statistical programs for analysis . A system for reporting adverse events is in operation and part of clinical practice , but not part of Mandobase . Sample size , number of participants necessary to demonstrate an effect : The female BED-patients ate with a median speed of 44 ( quartile range : 35-53 ) g/min and the male patients ate with a median speed of 47 ( 41-61 ) g/min during the week at home . Please not the large variation , making the slight sex difference statistically insignificant . Previous tests in the research laboratory have demonstrated that healthy , normal weight women and men eat with an average speed of approximately 30 g/min . Because the 25 pecentile speed of eating among female and male BED-patients is well above the mean speed of eating among the previouslty tested normal , healthy subject , it is necessary to recruite only 20 age-matched , healthy women and 10 men to demonstrate an effect . The effect will appear after one week of testing . The subjects will be recruited by advertisment at the local train station next to the campus of the Karolinska University Hospital , Huddinge . This manner of recruitment has been used in several experimental studies on eating behavior , using Mandometer , but normal weight , healthy subjects have never been tested at home . Also , previously tested subjects have been about 22 years old and the subjects to be recruited in the present trial should be matched for age with the BED-patients , i.e. , they should be about 38 years old . A relatively extensive literature indicates , however , that eating behavior is similar among 20 and 40 year old humans . Even so , data from these control subjects are necessary for testing the hypotheses of the present trial . Plan for missing data : data were obtained for all 166 BED-patients using Mandometer at home and for all 354 BED-patients subesequently using Mandometer in treatment ; missing data is not a problem and inconsistent data or out-of-range results have not been obtained . While it is thought that BN- and BED-patients can eat very large amounts of food , an intake of 1900 g of food has been obtained once in one patient only , the average intake is approximately 430 g in hundreds of test meals on BED-patients . Statistical analysis : Variations in food intake , meal duration , and speed of eating will be displayed as box plots , BMI will be shown as mean ( SD ) , and changes in these measures and measures of secondary outcome variables over time will be analyzed using ANOVA .",2015-02-10,"November 25, 2015","Inclusion Criteria : patients with binge eating disorder and normal weight , healthy controls Exclusion Criteria : ongoing drug abuse and/or other psychiatric diagnosis than binge eating disorder",386,0,28 Years,56 Years

However , despite advances in immunosuppressive therapy , long-term allograft survival outcomes have not improved over the last decade . A promising novel therapeutic immunosuppressive option in the treatment of renal recipients with a profound effect on the fibrosis reaction is the clinical application of mesenchymal stromal cells ( MSCs ) . Allogeneic MSCs offer the advantage of availability for clinical use without the delay required for expansion . Although it is believed that allo MSCs are immune privileged , they could possibly elicit an anti-donor immune response , which may increase the incidence of rejection/ graft loss and impact the allograft survival on the long term . These safety issues should be studied before further studies are planned with allogeneic MSCs in the transplant setting . MSCs are infused at a time point when immune suppression is lowered and the kidney is at increased risk for developing immune mediated injury . In addition , a large amount of the kidneys already has signs of fibrosis at this time point and MSCs might reduce the fibrosis which so importantly affects long term survival . MSCs will have no Human Leucocyte Antigen ( HLA ) sharing with the mismatches of the donor and the recipient should have no antibodies directed to the MSCs to reduce the anti-donor immune respons risk .",2015-03-03,"June 30, 2019","Inclusion Criteria : Subject is willing to participate in the study , must be able to give informed consent and the consent must be obtained prior to any study procedure .

Each subject will participate in one treatment cohort only , residing at the Clinical Research Unit ( CRU ) from Day -1 ( the day before dosing ) to Day 6 ( 120 hours post-dose ) . Each cohort will be dosed in a leading edge design in which two subjects will receive study drug ( 1 active and 1 placebo ) on the first dosing day , and the last 6 will receive study drug ( 5 active and 1 placebo ) on the second dosing day . All subjects will return for a post-study visit 8 to 10 days after the dose of study medication . Cohorts will be dosed at 2 weekly intervals . There will be a review of safety data , after the first two subjects have been dosed and before dosing of the subsequent six subjects . There will be a complete review of safety and pharmacokinetic data of each cohort prior to each dose escalation .","Male healthy subjects conforming to the selection criteria will be invited to take part in the study . Screening visit ( Visit 1 ) After giving fully informed , written consent , subjects will attend the clinic . Subjects will undergo screening within 28 days prior to the first dose administration . Prior to the screening visit , subjects will : Refrain from vigorous exercise for 7 days Abstain from alcohol for 48 hours Subjects will sign the consent form in the presence of a CRU physician prior to any screening procedures being performed . The information recorded for all subjects , regardless of their suitability for the study , will be retained and archived The following information and procedures will be recorded and performed as part of the screening assessments : Medical history Ethnic origin , sex , age , height , weight , and BMI Vital signs : supine blood pressure , supine pulse rate , and oral body temperature Resting 12 lead ECG Physical examination Urine drugs of abuse screen , cotinine and breath alcohol Fasting clinical laboratory and serology investigations Up to 28 days after screening , subjects will attend the clinic . Subjects will be admitted to the research unit at approximately 13:00 hours in the afternoon the day before dosing ( Day -1 ; -19 hours pre-dose ) . Urine will be subjected to a screen for drugs of abuse and there will be a breath test for alcohol and cotinine . Detection of any of these substances will disqualify the subject from the study . A physical examination , check of inclusion/exclusion criteria , clinical laboratory evaluations , oral temperature and body weight will be performed . Subjects will be asked whether they have experienced any adverse events or taken any concomitant medication since their previous visit . Supper will be served starting at 19.30 hours and a snack at 21.00 hours , following which subjects will be fasting . Water will be allowed ad libitum throughout . On day 1 , the total first urine void of the morning for each subject will be collected into a polyethylene container and , from this , a sample will be taken for urinalysis and pre-dose / baseline F901318 concentration . Within one hour before dosing commences ( -1 hour ) , blood will be drawn for laboratory safety assessments ( haematology and clinical chemistry ) , and pre-dose baseline F901318 and metabolites concentration . Supine and standing blood pressure and pulse rate in triplicate , body temperature and a 12-lead ECG will be recorded . The subjects will also be connected to continuous ECG recording from -1 hour until 12 hours after the start of dosing . Subjects will be asked whether they have experienced any adverse events overnight . Any concomitant medications will be recorded . Option 1 : Subjects will then be dosed . This will be oral ingestion of a liquid formulation followed by 250 mL of water . Subjects will be dosed with regular ( at least 5 minute ) intervals between each subject . After initial dosing , the following measurements and observations will be obtained : • Blood samples for analysis of F901318 plasma concentration will be drawn at 15 , 30 , 45 , 60 , 75 , 90 , 120 minutes , then 3 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 18 , 24 , 36 , 48 , 72 , 96 and 120 hours following dosing . Pharmacokinetic blood samples will be analysed and reviewed before each dose escalation . After the first dose administration , the timing of each blood sample may if necessary be adjusted within the 120-hour period for the subsequent dose escalation . The basis for this decision will depend upon the pharmacokinetic profiles obtained from the preceding group of subjects . All changes will be documented in a file note . The number of samples or volume of blood drawn must not be increased without prior approval of the relevant ethics committee . Option 2 : If it appears from pharmacokinetic measurements that oral absorption is extremely rapid , leading to a high Cmax with a relatively low AUC0-12 , the dose may be split in half , with the second half being given 4-8 hours after the first . Under these circumstances , the blood sampling schedule would be decided prior to dosing but would not exceed 26 samples over a 120 hour period . For Both Options : Blood samples for analysis of metabolites will be drawn 4 and 8 hours after initial dosing . Blood will be collected for safety measurements ( haematology and clinical chemistry ) 24 , 48 and 72 hours post initial dosing . Complete urine collections for analysis of F901318 urine concentration will be made for the following intervals in relation to dosing : 0-4 , 4-8 , 8-12 , 12-16 , 16-24 , 24-48 , 48-72 , 72-96 and 96-120 hours after initial dosing .

Mansoura University,NCT02398123,Transversus Abdominis Plane Versus Caudal Block for Pediatrics,Mansoura University,1,1,Lower Abdominal Surgery,Other,Transversus abdominis plane block,Treatment,Quadruple,"The transversus abdominis plane ( TAP ) block is a relatively simple technique that provides myocutaneous anesthesia that , as part of a multimodal analgesic treatment , may be useful in the prevention and treatment of parietal postoperative pain . Initial experience with ultrasound TAP block demonstrated efficacy of the echo guided technique in different surgical procedures such as cesarean section , appendicectomy , laparoscopic cholecystectomy , infra umbilical surgery in adult and pediatric patients . Recently published clinical trials suggest that TAP block may represents an effective alternative to epidural anesthesia but further studies in larger population are necessary . Transversus-abdominis plane ( TAP ) block was found to increase analgesic consumption low thoracic-epidural analgesia ( TEA ) in ischemic heart disease patients after abdominal laparotomy ( 2 ) . Others found comparable results between continuous transversus abdominis plane technique and epidural analgesia in regard to pain , analgesic use and satisfaction after abdominal surgery ( 3 ) . The TAP block affords effective analgesia with opioid sparing effects , technical simplicity , and long duration of action . Some disadvantages include the need for bilateral block for midline incisions and absence of effectiveness for visceral pain ( 4 ) . TAP block has been associated with good pain relief and decreased intraoperative and postoperative opioids requirements after laparoscopic surgery ( 5 ) . The analgesic efficacy of the TAP block has been demonstrated in prospective randomized trials compared with placebo , in different surgical procedures such as abdominal surgery , hysterectomy , retro pubic prostatectomy , Caesarean section , laparoscopic cholecystectomy , and appendicectomy ( 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 5 and 10 respectively ) . All these studies have reported superiority of the TAP block in terms of reduction in visual analogue scale scores and morphine consumption . In this study the investigators try to compare Transversus Abdominis Plane ( TAP ) blocks versus caudal block for postoperative pain control after lower abdominal surgeries in pediatrics .","Children aged 1-7 years undergoing lower abdominal surgeries would be recruited in this randomized study . Children would be monitored by electrocardiogram , pulse oximeter and non-invasive blood pressure . After preoxygenation for three minutes , anesthesia would be induced with 8 % sevoflurane inhalation in 33 % oxygen and 66 % nitrous oxide ; 1ug/kg fentanyl is administered intravenously . Then laryngeal mask is inserted when conditions are satisfactory ( jaw relaxed , lash reflex disappeared , no coughing , gagging , swallowing ) . Anesthesia would be maintained with 2 % sevoflurane and nitrous oxide . An increase in blood pressure or heart rate by more than 15 % from preoperative value was defined as insufficient analgesia and was treated with fentanyl 0.5 µ/kg .

Methods : The patients will undergo full colonoscopy , the stool preparation will be infused through the colonoscope during withdrawal of the instrument .","Back ground : intestinal microbiota have a central role in disease pathogenesis , either in a form of a `` permissive '' role or as a direct pathogenic cause . Clostridium difficile colitis ; irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) and IBD have all been connected to a disturbance in the equilibrium of intestinal microbiome . But the causative mechanism is not yet known . ( 5-10 ) . Various bacteria including lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium bifidus are being empirically used as treatment for many intestinal ailments . The cause of inflammatory bowel disease in unknown but evidence is gathering that excessive immune reaction of intestinal immune system to microflora combined with a genetic predisposition are responsible for the chronic inflammation . Fecal microbial treatment ( FMT ) is a treatment that utilizes the microbiota of a healthy intestine as a probiotic preparation . The feces of a healthy individual is fluidized and that inserted into the intestinal tract of a sick individual , assuming that the healthy flora will colonize and cure the intestine . Previous work had shown success in fecal transplantation as a treatment for clostridium difficile colitis . There are also reports of the efficacy of this treatment for inflammatory bowel disease but currently the numbers are small . A review by Anderson et al describes 17 studies reporting treatment of IBD by FMT . ( 12 ) . In 9 cases it was done to treat IBD and in 8 cases for intestinal infection in IBD patients . Altogether 41 cases were reported , In some the FMT was inserted through a nasogastric tube directly to the duodenum , in some be colonoscopy and in some by an enema . A significant clinical improvement was reported in 19/25 patients . 13/17 stopped IBD treatment , 15/24 entered full clinical remission . In all 15 patients treated for infection the treatment was successful . No sever adverse effects were reported , Fever was developed in 8 cases and in one case there was exacerbation of colitis after treatment .

One month after FMT . Improvement will be defined as : For Ulcerative colitis : a decrease of at least 2 points in the partial mayo score , and a decrease of at least 1 point in endoscopic Mayo score . For Crohn 's disease : A decrease of at least 70 points in Crohn 's disease activity index ( CDAI ) . Materials and methods : Study population : 40 patients aged 18-80 years , with histological and endoscopic diagnosis of ulcerative colitis or crohn 's colitis who did not respond to either thiopurines or tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) inhibitors . Exacerbation will be defined as partial mayo score higher then 3 , with either CRP higher than 0.5 or endoscopic mayo score > 1 in ulcerative colitis and CDAI higher them 220 and C reactive protein ( CRP ) higher than 0.5 in Crohn 's colitis . Stool will be donated by the patients choice either from a relative , preferably a partner to minimize possible transference of an infective agent , alternatively samples will be ordered from `` open biom '' .

Newcastle-upon-Tyne Hospitals NHS Trust,NCT02398201,A Study of Bezafibrate in Mitochondrial Myopathy,Newcastle-upon-Tyne Hospitals NHS Trust,2,1,Mitochondrial Diseases,Drug,Bezafibrate,Other,,"The purpose of this study is to gather preliminary data on whether bezafibrate can improve cellular energy production in mitochondrial disease . Mitochondrial diseases are rare inherited disorders that arise due to deficient energy production within the cells of the body . Consequently , the typical clinical features arise in organs with high energy requirements . Mitochondrial disorders exhibit highly variable clinical effects , both between individuals and within families . Characteristic symptoms include muscle weakness ( myopathy ) , hearing loss , migraine , epilepsy and stroke like episodes in addition to diabetes and heart problems . Mitochondrial disorders can therefore impact considerably on both quality of life and life expectancy . Despite this , no proven disease modifying treatments are available . Pre-clinical studies have identified that several existing medications improve mitochondrial function . Of these , bezafibrate has the best supportive data and , because it is already licensed as a treatment for high blood fats , has a well characterised side effect profile . The investigators will therefore conduct a feasibility study of bezafibrate in people with mitochondrial myopathy . Ten affected participants will be recruited and will receive a titrating course of bezafibrate three times daily for 12 weeks .","Mitochondrial disorders are genetically determined metabolic diseases affecting approximately 1 in 5000 people . Current strategies for treating mitochondrial disorders are limited , and restricted to alleviating symptoms . A recently published Cochrane review did not identify any disease modifying treatments of proven benefit . There is therefore an urgent and currently unmet need for treatments that modify the underlying biochemical deficit and disease trajectory . Improving deficient oxidative phosphorylation ( OXPHOS ) pathways through induction of mitochondrial biogenesis is a potential approach to the treatment of mitochondrial disorders . This involves stimulating transcription factors for both nuclear and mitochondrial genomes simultaneously in order to up-regulate respiratory chain ( RC ) gene expression . This role is fulfilled by peroxisome proliferator activated receptor ( PPAR ) -γ coactivator-1α ( PGC-1α ) ; a pivotal transcriptional co-factor widely considered the master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis . PGC-1α interacts with a number of transcription factors . These include α , β/δ and γ isoforms of the peroxisomal proliferator activated receptors ( PPARs ) . This group of ubiquitously expressed nuclear receptors is activated by binding of fatty acids . Subsequently , transcription of genes involved in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation is induced , thereby enabling cellular metabolic shift from glycolysis . Additionally , PGC-1α co-activates estrogen related receptor alpha ( ERRα ) ; nuclear respiratory factors ( NRF ) 1 and 2 ( transcription factors bound to promoter regions of target nuclear genes involved in the respiratory chain ) ; and TFAM ( transcription factor A mitochondrial ) , which modulates mitochondrial DNA transcription and replication . PGC-1α expression is induced through cold exposure , starvation and exercise . The PPARs , AMP-protein activated kinase ( AMPK ) and sirtuin 1 ( Sirt1 ) also increase PGC-1α activity and provide a means through which this pathway can be pharmacologically manipulated . Indeed , several compounds have been identified that exert their effect in this way including : bezafibrate and the glitazones ( PPAR agonists ) ; metformin and AICAR ( AMPK ) ; and resveratrol ( Sirt1 ) . Of these , bezafibrate , glitazones and metformin have established relevance in diabetes and hyperlipidaemia . Their mechanism of action also provides a rationale for their use in other metabolic disorders such as obesity and mitochondrial disease . Indeed , bezafibrate has shown promise as a disease modifying pharmaceutical agent in pre-clinical studies using both cellular and animal models of mitochondrial myopathy . Cellular models of mitochondrial disease have demonstrated improvements in a variety of measures of mitochondrial function when grown in a bezafibrate enriched medium . This has included a cell line comparable to the specific patient group we propose to review in this feasibility study . Furthermore , a mouse model of mitochondrial myopathy has demonstrated improvement in clinically relevant outcomes including time to disease manifestation and life span . This phase II , open label , non-randomised feasibility study aims to build on the work obtained in pre-clinical studies and provide proof of principle data in humans affected with the most common form of mitochondrial muscle disease . This study is not designed to provide proof of efficacy . However , should bezafibrate exert a demonstrable molecular effect here , the investigators anticipate the need for larger , randomised trials of bezafibrate in the future . An additional aim of this feasibility study , is therefore obtaining the relevant data to determine how many patients the investigators would need in a larger trial ; and what biochemical and clinical measurements the investigators would use to determine drug effect in such a trial .",2015-03-09,"September 20, 2017","INCLUSION CRITERIA : The participant is willing and able to given informed consent for participation Confirmed mt.3243A > G mutation Evidence of myopathy Stable dose of current regular medication for at least 4 weeks prior to trial entry Not already taking fibrates No evidence of liver impairment Normal renal function with a creatine clearance of > 60ml/minute In the investigator 's opinion is willing and able to comply with all trial requirements Willingness to allow General Practitioner and Hospital Consultant to be notified of participation in the trial EXCLUSION CRITERIA : contraindication to MRI scanning Unstable or poorly controlled diabetes , as determined by the investigator .

University of Manitoba,NCT02735694,Cycloserine in the Treatment of Sleep Apnea,University of Manitoba,1,0,Sleep Apnea Syndromes,Drug,Cycloserine,Treatment,Triple,"This study is being conducted to determine whether cycloserine is effective for the treatment of sleep apnea . Cycloserine is an antibiotic that has been extensively used in the treatment tuberculosis . However , more recently it was shown to enhance memory responses . Cycloserine may enhance the response of respiratory muscles to apnea and potentially reduce the severity of sleep disordered breathing .","The passive human upper airway ( UA ) is a collapsible tube with a relatively high compliance . At atmospheric luminal pressure , its cross-sectional area varies considerably . Subjects in whom the pharynx is closed , or nearly closed , at near atmospheric pressure require an upper airway dilating force to maintain adequate ventilation . During wakefulness pharyngeal dilator muscles ( dilators ) provide the necessary force to permit an adequate flow , regardless of how collapsible the pharynx is . This dilator activity is substantially lost at sleep onset . Subjects in whom the passive UA can not permit adequate ventilation must recruit dilators through reflex mechanisms if they are to remain asleep . Recent studies have shown that activation of the muscles that open the airway in the course of obstructive apneas persists to a variable degree after the relief of obstruction , evidencing the presence of memory for prior activation in the the brain centers that supply the dilator muscles . Short-term potentiation ( STP ) is a neuro-physiological mechanism that results in a time-dependent increase in motor activity , that is not explainable by changes in stimulus intensity , and which persists after disappearance of the stimulus ( `` after-discharge '' ) . STP is well documented in diaphragmatic responses to chemical stimuli . Prominent STP in upper airway muscles would promote a stronger dilator response to upper airway occlusion . The after-discharge would also help to maintain dilator activity following the ventilatory phase of obstructive events , thereby mitigating recurrence of obstruction . Patients with obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) vary greatly in the extent to which this memory or STP is present . The investigators postulate that interventions that could potentiate the development of memory for prior activation would mitigate the recurrence of apneas and reduce the severity of obstructive sleep apnea . The same interventions , those that enhance memory for prior activation , would also likely improve central apneas in that these apneas represent loss of diaphragm activity following hyperventilation . Memory for prior activation of the diaphragm has been well documented in the past and appears to be defective in such patients . There has been extensive research into methods of improving neural memory . Cycloserine , an antibiotic that has been , and continues to be , used extensively in the treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis , was shown to be effective in promoting memory in small doses ( much less than those used for tuberculosis ) both in animals and humans . We , therefore , propose that cycloserine has the potential of enhancing the memory properties of neurones supplying pharyngeal muscles and propose to study the effect of using it on the severity of sleep apneas of the obstructive and central varieties . Patients who have been diagnosed with OSA following routine clinical sleep studies will be asked to participate . Participation involves agreeing to two additional full night studies in the sleep laboratory , separated by 1 week . Both studies will be identical to the routine clinical studies , except that the patient will be asked to swallow a capsule containing either placebo or 250 mg cycloserine 1 to 2 hours prior to going to sleep .

Cayston ( aztreonam ) oral aerosol using the PARI Altera Nebulizer System was approved by the FDA in February 2010 for CF patients 7 years of age or older with PA ( 2 ) . In 2011 , 35.8 % or patients in the National CF Patient Registry used Cayston for treatment ( 3 ) . Bacterial cultures suggest that the upper airways and lower airways of CF patients are cross-infected by PA and that the paranasal sinuses can act as a bacterial reservoir ( 4 ) . There is improved post-transplanation patient survival for recipients that undergo sinus surgery and daily nasal washes to reduce bacterial load ( 2 ) . Routine CF care does not generally include upper airway assessment . There are no published studies evaluating the effect of aerosol antibiotics to treat nasal and sinus infections in CF in combination with oral inhaled aerosol therapy to treat the lower airway disease . However Mainz and colleagues published a case report that suggested that sinonasal administration of tobramycin using the Pari Sinus nebulizer ( Pari Corp , Starnberg , Germany ) delayed PA lower respiratory infection in a 12 year-old with CF who had chronic mucopurulent rhinosinusitis ( 5 ) and studies in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease suggest that treating upper airways can also improve coexistent lower airway disease .",2015-11-03,"January 11, 2021","Inclusion Criteria : Males or females 7 years of age or older and able to perform pulmonary function testing Confirmed diagnosis of CF by the 1997 CF Consensus Conference criteria and followed by the VCU or EVMS CF clinic Presence of PA in 2 lower respiratory tract ( sputum ) cultures in the 24 months before screening Subjects and/or parent guardian must be able to give written informed consent prior to any study related procedure All sexually active female subjects who are of childbearing potential must agree to use an effective method of contraception ( i.e.condoms or abstinence ) .

This is a serious disease , widespread , difficult to live with for the patients , but also difficult to treat for practitioners who take care of these patients . It affects 1.6 % of the general population , but its incidence is 10 times higher ( up 40 % ) in patients with infertility . It occurs mainly by complex chronic pelvic pain and a negative influence on fertility . It is a disease whose complexity can be explained to four levels . Firstly , through its extremely polymorphic character with intraperitoneal superficial forms , ovarian forms and deep sub-peritoneal forms . Secondly by the plurality of the main symptoms which are individually non-specific and the frequency and / or intensity is not correlated with the severity of the disease . This non-specificity of symptoms partially explains the long lead misdiagnosis , which vary by 5 to 11 years . Thirdly , by its prevalence which seems very high and largely underestimated . If its precise estimate in the general population is so complicated , it seems very high in many studies of patients supported surgically for gynecological reasons . These very large prevalence figures are observed when some consultations support the hypothesis of a widespread and probably insufficiently evaluated disease .

Indiana University,NCT02724033,Comparative Study of Superficial Cervical Plexus Block and Nerve of Arnold Block and Incidence of PONV for Inner Ear Surgery,Indiana University,4,0,"Anesthesia, Pediatrics, Surgery",Procedure,regional nerve block,Prevention,Single,The investigators would like to compare the therapeutic and cost effectiveness of established therapies for postoperative nausea and vomiting to regional nerve blocks of the head and neck area an intervention known for analgesia but for which the antiemetic effects has n't been entirely explored . The rational is based on the knowledge of the anatomical innervation of the inner ear and the role of the parasympathetic nervous system in the emetic act . A lot of focus has been given on its counterpart the sympathetic nervous system and its role in painful conditions . The investigators believe that the nerve blockade of the parasympathetic innervation can have some beneficial effect in the post-surgical patient .,The researchers hypothesize another potential antiemetic mechanism by the blockade of the auricular branch of the vagus nerve at the ear canal ( commonly described as nerve of Arnold ) in conjunction with a block of the greater auricular nerve and lesser occipital nerve at the superficial cervical plexus level . The block would cover both the sensory innervation and of the ear canal and the inner ear . A regional anesthetic block prior to the surgical intervention on the inner ear at the superficial cervical plexus block is performed . This latter is a branch of the vagus nerve at the superficial cervical plexus ( erb 's point ) . The block would inhibit the vagal afferent to area postrema through inhibition of afferent vagal input to the medullary center . The emetic act ( vomiting ) is a highly integrated physiologic reflex involving both the somatic and autonomic nervous system . Researchers do not know how much of a relation there is between the vagal nerve branches involvement and incidence of nausea and vomiting effects are from the inner ear injury and or the inflammatory response type of response triggering the area postrema . The usual prophylactic treatment of PONV ( post operative nausea and vomiting ) has been limited to anti-emetics such as dexamethasone along with aggressive fluid therapy and adequate analgesia . Investigators are proposing to conduct a comparative study of the therapeutic and cost effectiveness of regional anesthesia and antiemetic therapy in the prevention and treatment of PONV in children undergoing inner ear surgical procedures .,2015-04-21,"May 27, 2020","Inclusion Criteria : Patient Age 1-18 yo Scheduled to have cochlear implantation , Tympanomastoidectomy , inner ear surgery Past history of PONV susceptibility Exclusion Criteria : Patient/ Parents refusal Infection at the site of local anesthetic injection Known coagulopathy Existing VP shunt Severe mental disability Any known allergic to dexamethasone ( Decadron ) and/or ondansetron ( Zofran )",37,0,1 Year,18 Years

However , it is essential to confirm the trend previously observed with this treatment before using it in current practice .","Rationale : In infancy , bronchiolitis is the most common acute infection of the lower respiratory tract and is most often caused by the respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ) . The current treatment of bronchiolitis is controversial . Although meta-analysis of nebulized bronchodilators or corticosteroids treatments failed to show any consistent benefits on admission rate , they remain widely used in pediatric emergency wards . A recent randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , clinical trial with a factorial design was conducted to determine whether treatment with nebulized epinephrine , a short course of high dose of oral Betamethasone , or both , resulted in a clinically important decrease in hospital admissions among infants with bronchiolitis who were seen in the emergency department . This study showed that infants in the epinephrine-betamethasone group were significantly less likely than those in the placebo group to be admitted by day 7 ( relative risk , 0.65 ; 95 % confidence interval , 0.45 to 0.95 , P = 0.02 ) . However , after adjustment for multiple comparisons , this result became insignificant ( P = 0.07 ) . This synergistic interaction was not anticipated but gave hope that the association nebulized epinephrine - short course of oral high dose of betamethasone might reduce the risk of hospitalization for infants who consulted pediatric emergencies for a moderate to severe acute bronchiolitis . It is therefore required to conduct a trial dedicated to this evaluation in the French population . Hypothesis : using Epinephrine-Betamethasone allows to reduce the rate of hospitalization of mild-to-severe acute viral bronchiolitis seen in pediatric emergency departments .",2015-10-18,"September 11, 2017","Inclusion Criteria : Infants aged 6 weeks to 12 months admitted in paediatric emergency First episode of acute bronchiolitis defined as : expiratory dyspnea with breath slowing and/or sibilants and/or crackles preceded by ( or associated with ) a nasopharyngitis more or less febrile Respiratory distress assessment index score ( RDAI ) of 4 to 15 after a nasopharyngeal clearance Agreement of at least one of the parents for his child to participate in biomedical research Affiliation to social security ( beneficiary or entitled ) , except beneficiary of State medical help Exclusion Criteria : Prematurity ( less than 37 weeks of gestation ) Antecedent of invasive respiratory ventilation during neonatal period Antecedent of lung or chronic cardiac pathology of wich rhythm disorder , acute obstructive cardiomyopathy and coronary insufficiency Immune deficiency Active viral infection ( hepatitis , zona , herpes , varicella , HIV ) Proven or suspected tuberculosis Exposure to varicella during 15 days before inclusion Severe distress ( defined as one of following signs : a pulse rate > 200/min , respiratory rate > 80/min , RDAI score > 15 , neurological disorders ) Nebulization ( aerosol spray ) of Salbutamol or other bronchodilator treatment during the 24 hours before the inclusion Inhalation ( spray ) of Salbutamol during the preceding 24 hours Oral or inhaled corticosteroids during the preceding 2 weeks Previous episode of wheezing or ascertained diagnosis of asthma Hypersensitivity to one of the constituting of oral betamethasone Vaccination by living vaccine during the preceding 2 weeks",195,0,6 Weeks,12 Months

According to centrally assessed HER-2 status : Patients with HER-2 positive tumors will receive FLOT +/- Herceptin / pertuzumab . The scope of the phase II portion of the trial is to evaluate pathological response rates of either regimen assessed by a centralized pathology and define safety and tolerability . Patients with locally advanced esophagogastric adenocarcinoma ( i.e . cT2 any N or any T N-positive ) with exclusion of distant metastases will be included in this trial . Patients will be stratified by age ( 18-69 vs. ≥ 70 ) , tumor site ( GEJ vs. gastric ) and clinical stage ( T1/2 vs. 3/4 and N- vs. N+ ) and randomized 1:1 to receive either FLOT ( Arm A ) or FLOT/Herceptin/pertuzumab ( Arm B ) . Arm A ( control group ) Patients randomized to Arm A will receive 4 pre-operative treatments of FLOT ( Docetaxel 50 mg/m² , iv over 2 h ; Oxaliplatin 85 mg/m² in 500 ml G5 % , iv over 2h ; Leucovorin 200 mg/m² in 250 ml NaCl 0.9 % , iv over 1 h ; 5-FU 2600 mg/m² , iv over 24 h ) on d1 , d15 , d29 , d43 of the preoperative treatment phase . Surgery is recommended to occur 4 weeks after last FLOT ( 4 weeks after d43 = day 71 ) . Patients will receive 4 additional post-operative treatments of FLOT on d1 , d15 , d29 , and d43 of the post-operative treatment phase . Post-operative treatment should start 6 to 8 weeks , but at maximum 12 weeks after surgery . Arm B ( Herceptin/pertuzumab group ) Patients randomized to Arm B will receive the FLOT regimen identical to Arm A as described above in conjunction with three-weekly Herceptin at 8mg/kg initial dose ( Day 1 , loading dose ) followed by subsequent doses of Herceptin at 6mg/kg on d22 and d43 and pertuzumab at 840mg on d1 , d22 , and d43 . Surgery is recommended to occur 4 weeks after last FLOT/Herceptin/pertuzumab dose ( 4 weeks after d43 = day 71 ) . Patients will receive 3 additional doses of Herceptin and pertuzumab on d1 , d22 , and d43 of the post-operative treatment phase , together with the postoperative chemotherapy . Moreover , patients will receive 11 additional doses of Herceptin and pertuzumab after the end of post-operative FLOT . In both of the arms , tumor assessments ( CT or MRI ) are performed before randomization and prior to surgery and then every 3 months thereafter until progression/relapse , death or end of follow-up . During treatment , clinical visits ( blood cell counts , detection of toxicity ) occur prior to every treatment dose .

Researchers also want to learn about the safety and effectiveness of this combination .","Central Venous Catheter : Many of the drugs given in this study and the stem cell transplant will be given by vein through a central venous catheter ( CVC ) . A CVC is a sterile flexible tube and needle that will be placed into a large vein while you are under local anesthesia . Blood samples will also be drawn through your CVC . The CVC will remain in your body during treatment . Your doctor will explain this procedure to you in more detail , and you will be required to sign a separate consent form . Study Groups : If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study , you will be assigned to a dose level of lenalidomide based on when you join this study . Up to 3 dose levels of lenalidomide will be tested . At least 2 participants will be enrolled at each dose level . The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level . Each new group will receive a higher dose than the group before it , if no intolerable side effects were seen . This will continue until the highest tolerable dose of lenalidomide is found . All participants will receive the same dose level of vorinostat , gemcitabine , busulfan , rituximab , and melphalan . However , if the first group of participants have any bad side effects , the dose level of gemcitabine may be lowered for all other groups . Busulfan Test Dose : In stem cell transplants , the days before you receive your stem cells are called minus days . The day you receive the stem cells is called Day 0 . The days after you receive your stem cells are called plus days . You will receive a test dose of busulfan by vein over about 60 minutes . This low-level test dose of busulfan is to check how the level of busulfan in your blood levels changes over time . This information will be used to decide the next dose needed to match your body size . You will most likely receive this as an outpatient during the week before you are admitted to the hospital . If it can not be given as an outpatient , you will be admitted to the hospital on Day -11 ( 11 days before your stem cells are returned to your body ) and the test dose will be given on Day -10 . Blood ( about 1 teaspoon each time ) will be drawn for pharmacokinetic ( PK ) testing of busulfan 11 times . PK testing measures the amount of study drug in the body at different time points and will help the study doctor determine what your dose of busulfan should be on study . These blood samples will be drawn at various timepoints before you receive busulfan and over about the next 11 hours . The blood samples will be repeated again on the first day of high-dose busulfan treatment ( Day -8 ) . A temporary heparin lock line will be placed in your vein to lower the number of needle sticks needed for these draws . If it is not possible for the PK tests to be performed , you will receive the standard fixed dose of busulfan . You will also receive palifermin by vein over about 30 seconds each day to help decrease the risk of side effects in the mouth and throat either during the 2 days before you are admitted ( inpatient ) or during the 3 days before you are admitted ( outpatient ) You may ask the study staff about the risks of palifermin . Study Drug Administration ( all patients ) : Beginning on Day -8 , you will swish caphosol and glutamine liquids in your mouth 4 times a day , for about 2 minutes each time . You will swish these liquids every day until you leave the hospital . You will swallow the glutamine . These drugs are used to help decrease the risk of side effects in the mouth and throat . On Days -9 through Day -2 , you will take lenalidomide and vorinostat by mouth , with food . If you the doctor thinks it is needed , you will receive rituximab by vein over 3-6 hours as part of standard of care , on Day -9 . On Day -8 , you will receive gemcitabine by vein over 4½ hours . On Days -8 through Day -5 , you will receive busulfan by vein over 2 hours . On Day -3 , you will receive gemcitabine by vein over 4½ hours and then melphalan by vein over 30 minutes . On Day -2 , you will receive melphalan by vein over 30 minutes . On Day -1 , you will rest ( you will not receive chemotherapy ) . On Day 0 , you will receive your stem cells by vein over about 30-60 minutes . You will receive 3 more doses of palifermin by vein over 15-30 seconds on Days 0 , +1 , and +2 . As part of standard care , you will receive G-CSF ( filgrastim ) as an injection under your skin 1 time each day starting on Day +5 until your blood cell levels return to normal . You may ask the study staff about the risks of filgrastim . Pregnancy Tests : If you can become pregnant and have regular menstrual cycles , blood ( up to 2 teaspoons ) will be drawn for a pregnancy test on the following schedule : Within 10-14 days and within 24 hours before your first dose of lenalidomide , even if you have not had a menstrual period due to treatment or you have only had 1 menstrual period in the past 24 months . One ( 1 ) time each week for 4 weeks , then every 4 weeks while taking lenalidomide . Four ( 4 ) weeks after you stop taking lenalidomide . If you have irregular menstrual cycles , you will have pregnancy tests every week for the first 28 days , then every 14 days while you are taking lenalidomide , again when you have been taken off of lenalidomide therapy , and then 14 and 28 days after you have stopped taking lenalidomide . Length of Study : As part of standard care , you will remain in the hospital for about 3-4 weeks after the transplant . After you are released from the hospital , you will continue as an outpatient in the Houston area to be monitored for infections and transplant-related complications . You will be taken off study about 100 days after the transplant . You may be taken off study early if the disease gets worse , if intolerable side effects occur , if you are unable to follow study directions , or if you choose to leave the study early . If for any reason you want to leave the study early , you must talk to the study doctor . It may be life-threatening to leave the study after you have started to receive the study drugs but before you receive the stem cell transplant because your blood cell counts will be dangerously low . Follow-Up : About 100 days after the transplant : You will have a physical exam . Blood ( about 4 teaspoons ) and urine will be collected for routine tests and to check your kidney and liver function . If the doctor thinks it is needed , you will have computed tomography ( CT ) and/or positron emission tomography ( PET ) scans to check the status of the disease . If the doctor thinks it is needed , you may have a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy to check the status of the disease . To collect a bone marrow aspiration/biopsy , an area of the hip is numbed with anesthetic , and a small amount of bone marrow and bone is withdrawn through a large needle . This is an investigational study . Lenalidomide is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of multiple myeloma ( MM ) and myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) .

Federal University of Mato Grosso,NCT02580214,Immunonutrition in Total Hip Arthroplasty,Federal University of Mato Grosso,2,1,"Arthroplasty, Hip Replacement",Dietary Supplement,Impact,Prevention,Single,"The aim of this pilot study was to investigate whether the use of a multimodal protocol of preoperative care plus preoperative immune nutrition would decrease the length of stay and acute phase inflammation in patients submitted to total hip arthroplasty ( THA ) . The study was designed to be randomized and controlled , but not double blind . The patients were randomized to receive either preoperative care based on evidence plus immune nutrition for 5 days prior to surgery ( Acerto group ) or traditional preoperative care ( control group ) . Main endpoints were length of stay and acute-phase postoperative response","A large broad of evidence has shown that traditional perioperative care have a weak scientific basis and needs to be changed . Multimodal or fast-track protocols of perioperative care for abdominal surgery have been associated with lower morbidity , lower costs and faster postoperative recovery when compared to traditional care . Similarly the prescription of perioperative immune nutrition for 5-7 days before major abdominal surgery may decrease the risk of infections and reduce postoperative length of stay ( LOS ) . Interestingly there is lack of studies on multimodal protocols of enhanced recovery and on immune nutrition in elective total hip arthroplasty ( THA ) . In Brazil , the ACERTO ( an acronym in Portuguese for acceleration of postoperative recovery ) protocol is a multimodal protocol of perioperative care that includes : shortening of preoperative fasting with carbohydrates ( CHO ) -rich drinks up to 2h before surgery , restriction of intravenous fluids and early postoperative re-feeding and mobilization . Recently as a dynamic protocol the Acerto protocol included the recommendation of perioperative immune nutrition . All the elements of the protocol are based on evidence and are recommended by various international guidelines and consensus . Thus , the aim of this pilot study was to investigate whether the use of the Acerto multimodal protocol plus preoperative immune nutrition would decrease the length of stay and acute phase inflammation in patients submitted to THA . METHODS This was a prospective randomized pilot study . All procedures were performed at São Mateus Hospital ( Cuiabá , Brazil ) from May 2012 to February 2013 . The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Júlio Müller University Hospital ( Federal University of Mato Grosso ) and all patients signed a term of informed consent . Inclusion and exclusion criteria . The investigators included adult patients of both sex having a hip osteoarthrosis and candidates of elective THA . Patients were excluded if they had fasting glycemia greater than 200mg/dl ; acquired immunodeficiency ( AIDS ) ; renal failure ( creatinin above 2 mg/dl ) ; cirrhosis ; moderate or serious Alzheimer 's disease ( clinical dementia rating score between 2 and 3 ) ; an American Society of Anesthesiologists ( ASA ) score higher than 2 ; previous spinal surgery ( arthrodesis ) or THA ( reviewing or changing the prosthetic ) ; and severe malnutrition ( history of loss of 10 % of body weight over the last 6 months ) . The investigators also excluded patients who did not have their blood samples taken at the scheduled time and those who broke perioperative protocol , e.g . the non-intake of the immune supplement in the Acerto group . Design of the study . Patients were consecutively included and randomized into two groups : Group Control and ACERTO group with the aid of electronic software of random numbers available at www.graphpad.com . All patients were assessed by a multidisciplinary team , who carried out a nutrition assessment , preoperative education , and collected the relevant anthropometric , biochemical and clinical data . Anesthesia and operative technique . Antibiotic prophylaxis was done with 2g of intravenous kefazolin at the time of anesthetic induction . Measures were taken against postoperative nausea and vomiting ( PONV ) according to the protocol applied by the anesthesia team and will be discussed in this paper . Preoperative sedation was done with intravenous midazolam ( 0.03 to 0.1mg/kg ) and propofol ( 30 to 60 mcg/kg/min ) No general anesthetic was applied in both groups . All subjects received epidural neuro-axis blockage at L3-L4 space with ropivacain 7.5 % to 10 % ( 150-200mg ) and morphine chlorate 2mg ( 30 to 50 micrograms/kg ) . The surgical access of the hip was done by anterior-lateral approach . The investigators used in all cases hybrid type total arthroplasty ( cementation of the femoral component and fixation of the acetabular component by means of pressure fitting of the implant to the bone and the addition of screws to the acetabular cup when necessary ) . Carbohydrate drink Patients belonging to the Acerto group received a drink ( 200 mL ) containing water plus 12 % maltodextrin 2h before the induction of anesthesia . Immune supplementation therapy . The patients in the ACERTO group received an immune supplement containing arginine , w-3 fatty acids , nucleotides , and vitamins ( Impact ; Nestlé ; Sao Paulo , Brazil . Formula : proteins : 23 % ( 77 % calcium caseinate , 23 % arginine ) ; carbohydrates : 52 % ( 100 % maltodextrin ) ; lipids : 25 % ( 68 % fish oil ; 20 % medium-chain triglycerides and 12 % corn oil ) , vitamins and electrolytes ) for five days prior to surgery , with a daily dosage of thress units ( 600ml per day in total ) . Blood samples . Blood samples were collected preoperatively and at the 2nd PO day and assayed for CRP assay . Criteria for hospital discharge . Discharge was signed by an orthopedic surgeon if all of these five parameters were fulfilled : patient is confident and willing to go home , no pain or pain controlled by oral analgesics , walking alone or with minimal help , no fever or signs of postoperative infection , and accepting normal oral diet Outcome variables The main outcome variable was the postoperative length of stay . As secondary outcome variables it was compared the evolution of serum C-reactive protein ( CRP ) overtime . Statistical analysis . The calculation of the sample was based on the premise that the intervention with the Acerto Project protocol would reduce the hospital stay length by 50 % . For a β error ( type II ) of 20 % and an α error ( type I ) of 5 % , it was calculated that 15 patients in each group would be sufficient for this study . Investigators used paired and unpaired t-test when samples were homogeneous or the Mann-Whitney test or the Wilcoxon test if samples were heterogeneous . Categorical variables were compared by the chi square test or Fisher exact test . Statistical analyses were made using the Minitab 14 and the null hypothesis rejection was fixed at 0.05 ( α=5 % ) .",2015-10-15,"October 19, 2015",Inclusion Criteria : We included adult patients ( 18-80 y/o ) of both sex having a hip osteoarthrosis and candidates of elective THA .

National Institutes of Health Clinical Center (CC),NCT02644525,Efficacy and Microfilaricidal Kinetics of Imatinib for the Treatment of Loa Loa,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID),2,0,Loiasis,Drug,Imatinib Mesylate,Treatment,Quadruple,"Background : Many people who live in west or central Africa are at risk for infection from a very small worm called Loa loa . This infection is acquired through the bite of a fly . Baby worms called microfilariae live in the blood . The infection most commonly causes skin itching , mild temporary limb swelling , and sometimes a adult worm can be seen in the white of the eye of an infected individual . Very rarely , people with this infection can develop problems with the kidneys and heart as a result of the worm 's effect on the immune system . Because the vast majority of people with the infection have minimal symptoms , people in Cameroon usually do not get treated . But infection with Loa loa can cause serious problems in people who are being treated for infections with other parasites ( namely , river blindness and lymphatic filariasis ) . Researchers want to find out of a drug called imatinib can treat Loa loa infection so that patients with this infection can safely receive other drugs to cure river blindness and lymphatic filariasis . Researchers believe imatinib can be a safe drug to use on Loa loa , because in the lab this drug kills the worms slowly , whereas other drugs which can cause treatment reactions usually kill the worms very quickly . Objective : To test if imatinib can treat Loa loa infection by killing the worms slowly . Eligibility : People ages 18-65 with non-severe Loa loa infection who are otherwise healthy Design : Participants will be screened with a physical exam and blood and urine tests . Participants will have a baseline visit . This will include a physical exam and blood and urine tests . It may include a stool sample . Participants will be randomly assigned to get 1 dose of either imatinib or a placebo . Participants will return to the clinic every day for 1 week , then once a week for 3 weeks . Visits will include a physical exam and blood tests . They will have urine tests in the first week . Participants will have follow-up visits 3 , 6 , and 12 months after taking the imatinib or placebo . These include a physical exam and blood tests . They may include urine and stool samples . If participants develop side effects , they will be treated for them .","With the discovery that people experiencing severe treatment reactions following mass drug administration ( MDA ) with ivermectin for onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis control were co-infected with Loa loa , there has been a need for new filaricidal drugs . Currently , Loa loa infection , considered relatively nonpathogenic , is not treated in endemic areas . However , because treatment for Loa loa can result in toxicity in people who are being concurrently treated for onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis , finding a new treatment for Loa loa has become a priority . Imatinib has recently been shown to be microfilaricidal in vitro at concentrations physiologically achievable after a single oral dose in humans . The current standard in loiasis treatment outside of endemic areas is to treat those with low microfilarial ( MF ) levels ( less than approximately 8,000MF/mL ) with diethylcarbamazine ( DEC ) . However , at high MF concentrations ( > 20,000 MF/mL ) serious side effects including encephalopathy and death have occurred with administration of DEC or ivermectin , a widely distributed microfilaricide throughout Africa . In endemic areas , this risk is avoided by not treating loiasis altogether . The adverse reactions are believed to be due release of a large antigen load due to rapid killing of large numbers of MF . The rapidity of killing is believed to be the main driver of these reactions seen at high MF counts . The purpose of this study is to assess how imatinib acts as a slow microfilaricide at levels ( < 2,500 MF/mL ) that have been safely treated previously with DEC and ivermectin . We aim to perform a dose escalation study to identify the minimum single oral dose that will be effective as a slow microfiaricidal drug against Loa loa . If imatinib is found to be effective and have kinetics which favor slow microfilarial killing , then this can serve as the basis for a larger study in which patients with very high microfilarial loads would be treated , as this is the at risk population in current MDA campaigns . This is a double blind , randomized , pilot phase 2 dose-escalation trial . Subjects will receive a dose of imatinib at 200 , 400 or 600 ( n = 5 each ) . Symptoms and blood microfilarial concentration will be assessed at baseline , daily for the first 7 days , then weekly for the next 21 days , then at 3 , 6 , and 12 months . These will be compared against an untreated placebo-controlled group of 5 subjects who will have the same data collected at these respective days .",2015-12-31,"May 13, 2022","INCLUSION CRITERIA : Age greater than or equal to 18 years old and less than or equal to 65 years Loa loa microfilaremia > 500 MF/mL and 1.5 , Platelets < 100,000/mL , Hemoglobin 60 U/L , total bilirubin > 1.7mg/dL , absolute neutrophil count equal to or less than 1500/mm ( 3 ) .

This is because the last case of type 2 wild poliovirus ( WPV2 ) was reported in 1999 and type 2 vaccine poliovirus is associated with the highest risk of causing paralysis due to reversion to vaccine derived poliovirus ( VDPV ) , in which the reverted virus acquires not only the ability to cause paralysis but also the ability to transmit from person-to-person . Withdrawal of OPV2 will be done through the replacement worldwide of trivalent OPV ( tOPV ) with bivalent ( types 1 and 3 ) OPV ( bOPV ) for use in routine immunization and in campaigns . After the tOPV to bOPV switch , there will be strict biosafety requirements for the use of vaccines containing OPV2 . Trivalent OPV will no longer exist and use of monovalent OPV2 ( mOPV2 ) will be limited to responding to a type 2 outbreak . To respond to poliovirus type 2 outbreaks , the Global Polio Eradication Initiative has proposed delivering using mOPV2 in campaigns conducted in the primary zone of the outbreak and IPV in campaigns conducted in areas adjacent to outbreak zone . Therefore , mOPV2 will be a critical component of response to poliovirus type 2 outbreaks . Typically , polio campaigns are conducted at an interval of 4 weeks . Recently , a clinical trial conducted by icddr , b and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) in Matlab and Mirpur in Bangladesh demonstrated non-inferiority of type 1 seroconversion after bOPV or mOPV1 at a 2 week interval compared to 4 weeks between doses . Based these findings , the Global Polio Eradication Initiative ( GPEI ) concluded that the immune response to `` OPV is satisfactory when the interval between doses is shortened to 14 or even 7 days ( in case of mOPV1 ) '' and has used short-interval campaigns to deliver mOPV1 and bOPV in areas with security-limited access and for outbreak response . However , there are no data and no current or planned polio clinical trials are assessing the impact on immunogenicity of mOPV2 of a reduction in the interval between mOPV2 doses or of administration of mOPV2 in combination with IPV . Therefore , the findings from the trial proposed in this protocol have a direct and immediate implication on strategies to respond to type 2 polio outbreaks . Field site : The study will be carried out in urban slums in Mirpur and Mohakahli in Dhaka .",2015-12-10,"January 23, 2018","Inclusion Criteria : Infants 6 weeks of age ( range : 42-48 days ) .

University of Cologne,NCT02641782,NB2013-HR German (GPOH) / Dutch (DCOG) Trial,University of Cologne,2,0,Neuroblastoma,Drug,antibody ch14.18,Treatment,,"Although the five year survival rate of children with high risk neuroblastoma have increased over the last three decades from 4 to 44 % ( 1 ) , neuroblastoma is the second most frequent cause for cancer related death in childhood ( 11 % ) . Most patients show good initial response rates ( complete ( CR ) and partial remission ( PR ) rate 95 % ) , but 55 % experience a largely treatment-resistant tumor progression . Recently , a breakthrough with immunotherapy was reported by US investigators from the Children 's Oncology Group ( 2 ) using the anti-ganglioside D2 ( GD2 ) monoclonal antibody ch14.18 for tumor cell destruction and granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) plus interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) for immunostimulation . This immune therapy resulted in an increase of 20 % Event free survival ( EFS ) at 2 year from randomization . However , this was associated with a high toxicity rate ( pain , capillary leak syndrome ) . The proposed trial compares the Childrens ' Oncology Group ( COG ) `` standard of care '' arm ( anti-GD2 + GM-CSF + IL-2 i.v . + retinoic acid oral ) with an experimental arm ( anti-GD2 + GM-CSF + IL-2 s.c. + retinoic acid oral ) designed to reduce toxicity . The potential benefit from this trial consists of the confirmation that the American trial design is feasible in an independent set of patients with different preceding therapy , at a different time point regarding to immune reconstitution after autologous stem cell transplantation ( ASCT ) , the feasibility of a newly designed immunotherapy ( which is hopefully less toxic ) and the investigation of immune response parameters . This pilot study is the prerequisite for a consecutive randomized clinical trial comparing two immunotherapeutic approaches in a larger set of patients .","Neuroblastoma is the second most frequent solid tumour ( 7.6 % ) and the second cause of cancer related death ( 11 % ) in childhood . In particular the large high risk ( HR ) group has remained a challenge to Paediatric Oncologists . Although the 5 year survival rates of children with HR disease have increased over the last 3 decades from 4 to 44.4 % , the vast majority of those children will finally succumb to disease [ 1 ] . Most patients show good initial responses to chemotherapy ( CR + PR-rate 95 % ) , but a majority experiences a highly treatment resistant tumour progression ( 55 % ) . Therefore new therapeutic modalities are urgently needed . Recently , a randomized trial demonstrated that an immunotherapeutic concept using the anti-GD2 antibody ch14.18 together with interleukin 2 , GM-CSF and retinoic acid improved the outcome of neuroblastoma patients which achieved CR or very good partial remission ( VGPR ) response to the preceding therapy . This treatment was associated with a high rate of toxic effects ( neuropathic pain 52 % of patients , capillary leak syndrome 23 % ) . An earlier study using the antibody ch14.18 alone made comparable observations : pain despite of analgesia was seen in 33 % of patients and severe capillary leak syndromes in 3 of 151 children . Differences of the reported frequencies are due to the different definitions of side effects . The investigators therefore propose a randomized clinical trial comparing the COG immunotherapy concept with newly designed hopefully equally effective but less toxic concept . This modifies the application route of IL-2 from i.v . to s.c. and increases the IL-2 dose to 6.0 mio/m²xd ( from 3.0 first week and 4.5 mio second week i.v. ) . Oral retinoic acid is used in both arms . The proposed randomized trial will answer the following questions : ( i ) Confirmation of the feasibility to apply the COG immunotherapy as consolidation treatment after a different remission induction therapy in patients with recurrent and de novo high risk neuroblastoma ( ii ) Investigation of the feasibility to apply the new immunotherapy concept in patients with recurrent high risk neuroblastoma ( iii ) Comparison of the toxicity of both immunotherapy regimens with the aim to reduce grade 2 - 4 toxicities in the experimental arm . ( iv ) Comparison of the immune response ( antiidiotype antibodies , immune cell phenotypes , immune mediators , functional assays as antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity ( ADCC ) and complement dependent cytotoxicity ( CDC ) between treatment cycles ( intraindividual ) , treatment arms ( interindividual ) and between recurrent and newly diagnosed patients ( v ) Comparison of pharmacokinetics of antibody ch14.18 in both arms ( 12.10 . ) ( vi ) Comparison of therapeutic efficacy by response evaluation at the end of the 25 week treatment ( descriptive ) .

Baylor College of Medicine,NCT02640573,Treatment of Adult Patients With Hemoglobin SC Disease (SCYTHE),Baylor College of Medicine,2,0,Hemoglobin SC Disease,Drug,Hydroxyurea,Treatment,,"Sickle cell disease ( SCD ) , specifically hemoglobin SC disease ( HbSC ) , is a subtype of sickle cell disease with typically higher hemoglobin and milder or later disease complications . Sickle cell disease is a disorder in which red blood cells ( RBCs ) are abnormally shaped . This can result in painful episodes , serious infections , and damage to body organs . One medication used to treat sickle cell disease is hydroxyurea . Hydroxyurea therapy offers significant benefits for infants , children , and adolescents with sickle cell anemia . These include a reduction in the frequency of pain crises and acute chest syndrome ( inflammation of the lungs ) . Hydroxyurea has been given to many HbSC patients but HbSC patients were not included in the large clinical trials used to test hydroxyurea in SCD , so less is known about how HbSC patients respond to hydroxyurea . The purpose of this research study is to see if hydroxyurea , a medication given to many patients with the most common type of sickle cell , those who are homozygous for the sickle mutation ( HbSS ) , helps individuals who have HbSC . The investigators will see if it helps by giving a questionaire when the medication is started , and then every two months at a clinic visit . The questionaire , called the AdultsQLTM 3.0 Sickle Cell Disease Module , measures quality of life . The investigators will also see how hydroxyurea changes laboratory test numbers , and blood thickness .","Patients will be recruited from the patient population followed at the Texas Children 's Cancer and Hematology Centers ( TCC/HC ) /Baylor College of Medicine ( BCM ) and the University of Texas Houston Hematology Center . To be eligible to participate in this study , patients must have HbSC disease , have experienced a sickle cell disease related complication , or have a score of 80 or lower on the AdultQLTM Sickle Cell Disease Module 3.0 . This questionnaire will be offered to all patients with HbSC seen in our clinic that consent to this study . Patients must also agree to clinic visits every two months , and to phlebotomy , or blood removal after 6 months on the study if they meet criteria for phlebotomy . If the patient is a sexually active female , they will be offered birth control . If the patient chooses not to initiate effective birth control , they will be tested at their scheduled visit with a urine pregnancy test . If the patient becomes pregnant they will be removed from the study . Patients will be assessed in clinic every two months after starting treatment . Hydroxyurea will be started at 10 mg/kg/day , and increased by 5 mg/kg/day if needed to a maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) of 35/mg/day . The most common side effect of the drug is a drop in infection fighting cells , or white blood cells , so the medication will be started at a low dose and the dose will be increased only if it is safe to do so . After 6 months at MTD on the study , patients will be evaluated for their response to hydroxyurea . If they have not reached their MTD after 6 months their time on the study will be increased to allow for 6 months observation at MTD . The minimum time the patients will be on the study is 12 months after starting hydroxyurea therapy with an option to participate in a 2 year observation study following the end of the study . If the patients have had minimal or no benefit from the medication , monthly phlebotomy will be added to their treatment regimen , at 7-10 ml/kg . The first phlebotomy volume will be 7 ml/kg , but may be increased to 10 ml/kg to obtain the target Hb of 9-10 g/dL . Patients will remain on hydroxyurea and phlebotomy for six months . If their Hb is less than or equal to 9.0 g/dL on their phlebotomy visit , phlebotomy will not be performed and their phlebotomy visits will be spaced every 2 months . Patients time on the study will be increased to allow for 6 months observation to ensure that there is no late harmful effects . The minimum time patients will be on the study is 18 months after starting phlebotomy with an option to participate in a 2 year observation study following the end of the study .

Rush University Medical Center,NCT02711891,Topical Loperamide Gel for Pain Reduction During Repeat Finger Lancing,Rush University Medical Center,0,1,Pain,Drug,Loperamide,Treatment,Double,This study evaluates topical loperamide 5 % gel in reducing pain during repeat finger lancing ( finger stick ) in healthy adults . Half of participants received 5 % loperamide gel applied to their fingertip prior to their second lance and the other half received the gel only .,"Lancing the finger and heel to obtain capillary blood for specimen collection and diagnostic testing is a painful and tissue damaging procedure . With each lance , there is direct splicing of capillaries along with free nerve endings resulting in an immediate localized pain response and hyperalgesia from the release of pain producing substances . Opioid agonists ( morphine , fentanyl , loperamide ) have demonstrated significant analgesia when locally injected or topically applied to a site of inflammation/injury in animal models . Loperamide , a piperdine derivative with a structure similar to the synthetic opioid meperidine , has strong affinity for Mu opioid receptors . It was approved by the FDA in 1969 as an anti-diarrheal agent with Mu opioid activity mimicked the constipating effects of other opioids , but with markedly reduced CNS effects due to its affinity for p-glycoprotein , preventing crossing the blood brain barrier ( BBB ) under normal circumstances . This prospective , double-blind , repeated measures , randomized investigational new drug trial used loperamide developed as a topical gel in 34 adult participants to determine its analgesic effects during repeat finger lancing . The investigators also assessed for any local skin reaction to the gel application and for any constipation or abdominal cramping which might be evidence of systemic absorption and Mu opioid agonist activity on the gut . This study would be applicable for use in 28.9 million adults who are diabetic and require finger lancing for blood glucose monitoring and the high risk newborn population who require repeat heel lancing for specimen collection .",2015-12-11,"March 16, 2016",Inclusion Criteria : Healthy volunteers willing to have 2 consecutive finger sticks completed .

Vanderbilt University Medical Center,NCT02591173,Blood Pressure Lowering Effects of Angiotensin-(1-7) in Primary Autonomic Failure,Vanderbilt University Medical Center,0,0,Autonomic Nervous System Disorders,Drug,Angiotensin-(1-7),Treatment,Double,"Pharmacologic approaches to increase levels or actions of the vasodilatory peptide angiotensin- ( 1-7 ) are currently in development for the treatment of hypertension based on findings from animal models . There are limited and contradictory clinical studies , however , and it is not clear if this peptide regulates blood pressure in humans . The purpose of this study is to better understand the cardiovascular effects angiotensin- ( 1-7 ) in human hypertension , and to examine interactions of this peptide with the autonomic nervous system . The investigators propose that the difficulties in showing angiotensin- ( 1-7 ) cardiovascular effects in previous clinical studies relates to the buffering capacity of the baroreceptor reflex to prevent changes in blood pressure . Autonomic failure provides the ideal patient population to test this hypothesis . These patients have loss of baroreflex buffering and have low levels of angiotensin- ( 1-7 ) in blood . The investigators will test if angiotensin- ( 1-7 ) infusion can lower blood pressure in patients with autonomic failure , and will determine the hemodynamic and hormonal mechanisms involved in this effect .","This is an inpatient study that requires at least four days of admission to the Vanderbilt Clinical Research Center . Autonomic failure patients will be placed on a fixed diet during the admission and will have routine tests performed for screening and clinical characterization .

Duke University,NCT02590393,The Role of Nicotine and Non-Nicotine Alkaloids in E-Cigarette Use and Dependence,Duke University,1,1,Nicotine Dependence,Combination Product,E-cigarettes,Basic Science,,"The advent of electronic cigarette ( e-cigarette ) technologies represents one of the most significant developments in the last several decades , and provides a novel and promising strategy for substantially reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with smoking . However , serious concerns have been raised regarding the possibility that e-cigarettes will sustain a dependency on nicotine and that they may lead to continued use of conventional cigarettes known to be extremely harmful to health . Cigarette addiction critically involves a dependence on nicotine , but it is likely that other tobacco constituents contribute to dependence as well . Recent evidence suggests that non-nicotine tobacco alkaloids , or NNTAs ( including anabasine , anatabine , nornicotine , and myosmine ) may play a role in tobacco dependence . These alkaloids have been shown to augment the reinforcing effects of nicotine in animal models and to affect cravings in human smokers . E-cigarettes contain variable quantities of nicotine and NNTAs , but there is virtually no information available concerning the role of e-cigarette nicotine or NNTA content in influencing the concurrent use of cigarettes and e-cigarettes , when smokers attempt to switch from conventional combustible cigarettes to e-cigarettes . Additionally , it is not known whether the presence of nicotine and NNTAs in e- cigarettes may sustain dependence , making it difficult to relinquish these products . The proposed project will assess the acceptability , extent of switching behavior , and degree of dependence maintained when smokers are provided with e-cigarettes containing nicotine and NNTAs .","A single group of thirty smokers will be recruited for the study to provide initial data to inform follow-up randomized controlled trials . Dependence and concurrent use of e-cigarettes and cigarettes will be assessed by a battery of self-report , biochemical , and behavioral indices . This is not a tobacco cessation study and there is no intent to use e-cigarettes as a smoking cessation treatment . Smokers will be asked to use the e-cigarettes instead of their regular cigarettes during the study . E-cigarettes will not be used for the purpose of reducing urges , withdrawal or nicotine dependence ; and e-cigarettes will not be described or used as a medical device or therapy . Specific Aim 1 : To assess the extent of switching from combustible cigarettes to e-cigarettes delivering nicotine along with NNTAs . Switching will be assessed by self-report diaries and by reductions in expired air carbon monoxide , an index of combustible cigarette use . Specific Aim 2 : To assess the acceptability of e-cigarettes delivering nicotine along with NNTAs . Ratings of user satisfaction and other subjective effects will be collected from participants , for both their customary brand of cigarettes and the e-cigarette to be used .

Outpatient treatment will consist of a 7-day outpatient detoxification / naltrexone induction procedure followed by 8-weeks of treatment with Vivitrol .,"The rates of opioid use in youth are rising . Long-acting injectable naltrexone ( Vivitrol ) , a medication that blocks the effects of opioid drugs , has been shown to be effective for treatment of opioid dependence in adults . Vivitrol is an important option for individuals not wanting agonist treatment ( e.g . buprenorphine , methadone ) . Vivitrol may be particularly appealing to youth who have difficulty reaching their opioid use goals with daily oral medications as it is a monthly injection and therefore eliminates the problem of daily medication non-adherence . Vivitrol may also be appealing to families as it reduces conflicts around issues of adherence and thus supports positive parenting . Whereas Vivitrol has been used clinically in minors , it has not been studied in a prospective outpatient trial . Starting naltrexone , however , can be challenging in opioid-dependent individuals because detoxification is required prior to treatment with this medication.There are no standard outpatient detoxification protocols for opioid-dependent youth . Therefore , more studies are needed to support broader and approved use of Vivitrol in this population . The purpose of this open-label pilot study is to determine the tolerability and applicability of outpatient long-acting injectable naltrexone ( Vivitrol ) treatment in individuals age 16-25 ( `` older youth '' ) with opioid use disorder . We aim to have 16 older youth complete this trial . Participants will undergo an outpatient detoxification / induction procedure that has been honed over the past 13 years of work with this medication by others in our Division and is currently being used safely in opioid-dependent adults in an ongoing clinical trial . The detoxification / induction procedure consists of a single day of buprenorphine followed by a washout day and 4 days of ascending oral naltrexone doses prior to administering a dose of injectable naltrexone , typically at Day 8 . Participants will then receive an additional Vivitrol injection 4 weeks after the first ; they will also receive weekly medication management therapy with a research psychiatrist . Following the 9 week trial , participants and are eligible for an additional third injection followed by up to 4 weeks of therapy while proper follow-up treatment is arranged .

Milton S. Hershey Medical Center,NCT02592629,The Efficacy of Local Anesthetics to Reduce Shoulder Pain Post-Steroid Injections,Milton S. Hershey Medical Center,4,0,Shoulder Pain,Drug,lidocaine,Treatment,,The specific aim of this prospective study is to determine whether local anesthetics prior to subacromial steroid injections reduce pain and consequently if they are cost-effective in the treatment for shoulder pathology .,"Shoulder pain is a common problem that can be estimated to be prevalent in up to 15 percent of the patient population registered to general practices and is second only to back pain in patients seeking treatment for musculoskeletal issues in the primary care setting . As a common source of distress , shoulder pain contributes significantly to health care costs . Rotator cuff disease due to impingement , tendonitis or bursitis is a frequent cause of shoulder pain and dysfunction . Initial treatment consists of a conservative approach of activity modification , oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) and supervised physical therapy . However , if the patients ' symptoms persist , subacromial injections of a local anesthetic such as lidocaine , and a corticosteroid may be indicated as a sequential treatment option . The steroid injection itself can be a painful process , so administering a local anesthetic prior to the steroid injection is thought to mitigate pain or reduce possible discomfort during and immediately following the procedure . Though there is evidence advocating for the benefits of combining local anesthetics and corticosteroids for the treatment of subacromial pathologies , it is not conclusive whether local anesthesia significantly enhances the pain relieving effect of steroids . Should local anesthesia not have a significant impact on the patient 's pain intensity , then the use of corticosteroids alone could potentially result in reduced costs in care .",2015-10-28,"September 17, 2018","Inclusion Criteria : Ages 18 to 70 years old Shoulder pain lasting at least 4 weeks Inability to use arm with restriction of movement and loss of full function .

Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre,NCT02593643,Effect of Ketamine vs. Active Placebo on Suicidal Ideation in Depressed Inpatients With Major Depressive Disorder or Bipolar Depression.,Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre,0,1,Major Depressive Disorder,Drug,Ketamine,Treatment,Double,"Depression and suicidal ideation/attempt/death are major causes of morbidity and mortality from psychiatric illnesses . In 2009 , the World Health Organization listed depression as the leading cause of years lost due to disability worldwide . Suicide is the 9th most common cause of death in Canada with 1.6 % of Canadians ultimately dying from suicide ( Statistics Canada , 2012 ) and the 2nd most common cause of death in young people after accidental deaths . This information highlights the importance of finding treatments to prevent suicidal deaths . Ketamine has been shown to provide rapid treatment response for major depressive episodes both in major depressive disorder ( MDD ) and bipolar disorder ( BD ) , via a single intravenous infusion which persists for at least 72 hours . The purpose of this study is to conduct a pilot trial of IV ketamine + treatment as usual ( TAU ) vs. midazolam ( an active placebo ) + TAU to estimate sample size for a full-scale RCT examining these treatments for decreasing suicidal ideation among depressed inpatients with major depressive disorder and bipolar depression . A total of 52 patients will be recruited for this trial . All subjects will be inpatients at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre with a diagnosis of either major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder type I or II currently depressed . Suicidal ideation must be present at baseline assessment in order to be included in the study . Thirteen subjects will be randomized to each treatment arm in each treatment stream - that is , 13 will be recruited to ketamine + TAU in the major depressive disorder stream , and 13 will be recruited to the midazolam + TAU in the major depressive stream . Likewise , 26 subjects with bipolar depression will be randomized to these two treatments .","Depression and suicidal ideation/attempt/death are major causes of morbidity and mortality from psychiatric illness . The World Health Organization ( 2009 ) lists depression as the leading cause of years lost due to disability worldwide . Suicide is the 9th most common cause of death in Canada with 1.6 % of Canadians ultimately dying from suicide ( Statistics Canada , 2012 ) and the 2nd most common cause of death in young people after accidental deaths . The investigators ' data show that at least 50 % of people dying from suicide in Toronto suffer from depression with a small proportion ~12 % suffering from BD . These data underscore the urgency of developing new treatments for both MDD and BD but also the suicidality that is often associated with them . Ketamine treatment represents a potentially viable , safe and effective treatment for MDD/bipolar depression + SI . The Investigators therefore propose to conduct a pilot trial in preparation for a full- scale randomized controlled trial ( RCT ) which would aim to determine the efficacy of IV ketamine + a standard medication treatment ( Treatment As Usual ; TAU ) vs. midazolam , an `` active '' placebo + TAU in treating SI among inpatients with MDD and in inpatients with bipolar depression . If the full-scale RCT demonstrates ketamine 's efficacy , it would have important implications for both future research as well as inpatient treatment . The primary objective is to conduct a pilot trial of IV ketamine + TAU vs. midazolam + TAU to estimate sample size for a full-scale RCT examining these treatments for decreasing SI among depressed inpatients with MDD and bipolar depression . The primary hypothesis is that the effect size for reducing SI in the ketamine group vs. the midazolam group will be in the moderate range or above ( d > 0.5 at 14 and 42 days ) in terms of reduction in scores on the Scale of Suicidal Ideation ( SSI ) and the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale ( CSSRS ) for both subjects with MDD and subjects with bipolar depression . Further , there are secondary objectives and secondary hypotheses . The secondary objectives are : To estimate effect size for producing clinical response ( ≥50 % reduction in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) scores ) and remission ( MADRS 0.5 at 14 and 42 days ) . There will be a significantly more rapid reduction in SSI , CSSRS and MADRS scores in the ketamine group than in the midazolam group . [ bipolar depression stream only ] Manic symptoms will occur in < 10 % of all subjects and there will be no differences between the two groups . Finally , the exploratory objectives are : To determine whether mean time to discharge differs between the ketamine and midazolam groups in both MDD and bipolar depression . To determine whether subject satisfaction is differs between the ketamine group and in the midazolam group . And exploratory hypotheses : Mean time to discharge from hospital will be faster in the ketamine than in the midazolam group in both MDD and bipolar depression . Subject satisfaction will be higher in the ketamine than in the midazolam group in both MDD and bipolar depression . Subjects will be inpatients at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre with a diagnosis of either MDD or BD type I or II currently depressed . To be included in the study , SI must be present at the time of baseline assessment . Subjects will be recruited on the first regular week day ( non-weekend/holiday ) after their admission . This is the day on which a comprehensive inpatient treatment plan is typically developed . Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 double-blind fashion to two groups in both a MDD and a BD stream . That is , 13 subjects will be randomized to ketamine + TAU and 13 subjects will be randomized to midazolam + TAU in the stream for subjects with MDD . Likewise 26 subjects with bipolar depression will be randomized to these two treatments . Subjects in the ketamine IV groups will receive infusions 3 times weekly for two weeks ( 0.5 mg/kg infused over 40 minutes on approximately days 1 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 10 and 12 of admission ) . The exact schedule of dates is referred to as approximate since it may need to be adjusted slightly depending on the timing of admission/weekends etc . Subjects in the midazolam group will have the same dosing schedule but will instead receive midazolam 0.045 mg/kg IV infused over 40 minutes . A sub-anesthetic dose of midazolam was chosen as an active placebo because it has CNS effects including sedation and amnestic effects , thus making it more difficult for subjects to guess which group they are in . Vital signs including pulse , respiratory rate and arterial oxygen saturation will be monitored throughout the ketamine/midazolam infusion and for one hour post-infusion as has been the standard in the published literature . If the subject experiences side effects , the protocol will allow for the infusion to be slowed to up to 90 minutes . Subjects will also receive TAU during the course of the study in addition to IV ketamine or midazolam treatment . In the MDD group , TAU may include a newly initiated or longstanding antidepressant . In the BD group , TAU may include a mood stabilizer such as lithium or valproate that is a first or second line agent as per Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments ( CANMAT ) guidelines ( Yatham et al. , 2013 ) . This is done in an attempt to mitigate the risks of relapse after cessation of ketamine therapy and also makes the use of midazolam treatment ethically justifiable . The duration of the study is two weeks . All subjects will receive all 6 treatments , regardless of whether their symptoms have remitted , given recent evidence that 6 IV ketamine treatments led to a more robust and lasting response compared to only 1-3 treatments ( Aan Het Rot et al. , 2012 ) . If subjects are discharged before 2 weeks , they will be asked to return to hospital as outpatients for any remaining ketamine treatments as well as for outcome measures at 2-weeks and 42 days . TAU will be maintained after discharge . Depression , suicidal ideation measures ( MADRS , SSI , CSSRS ) and , in the BD stream , mania measures ( Young Mania Rating Scale ; YMRS ) will be administered on admission , on treatment days in the morning prior to ketamine/midazolam administration and on days 14 and 42 . At both days 14 and 42 , subjects will also be asked to rate their satisfaction with the study .",2015-10-29,"July 25, 2017","Inclusion Criteria : Provision of written informed consent [ MDD stream only ] Diagnosis of major depressive disorder , currently depressed as determined by DSM-IV diagnostic criteria ( confirmed using the MINI ) [ BD stream only ] Diagnosis of bipolar disorder , type I or type II , currently depressed as determined by DSM-IV diagnostic criteria ( confirmed using the MINI ) Both females and males , aged 18 to 65 years Inpatient status Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative urine human chorionic gonadotropin ( hCG ) test at enrolment and must be taking or willing to take some acceptable form of birth control during the course of the study if they are or plan to be sexually active The ability to understand and comply with the requirements of the study and capable of providing informed consent Suffering from suicidal ideation/attempts as evidenced by a score of > 0 on either of the SSI or CSSRS or both .

Hospital Ambroise Paré Paris,NCT03153813,Capsaicin Patches In Knee Osteoarthritis In Obese Patients,Nadine ATTAL,3,0,Pain,Drug,capsaicin 8% patches (Qutenza),Other,Double,To assess the efficacy and safety of high concentration capsaicin patches in pain due to osteoarthritis ( OA ) of the knee in patients with obesity,"Osteoarthritis is one of the leading causes of pain and disability . In France osteoarthritis of the knee , the most common form of osteoarthritis has been recently estimated to affect 4.7 % of men and 2.5 % of women . One particularly exposed population to osteoarthritis is represented by obese patients . Obesity , defined as a body mass index ( BMI ) above 30 kg/m² , is considered to be one of the most important risk factors for osteoarthritis ( OA ) in knees . Numerous longitudinal studies show a strong association between obesity , and radiographic knee OA , e.g . in the Framingham Study , the Chingford Study , the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging , the John Hopkins Precursors Study , and in longitudinal studies in UK and the Netherlands . Thus , the WHO initiative on counteracting obesity also accepts OA as a consequence of obesity . Each BMI increase by 1 kg/m² is associated with a 15 % increased risk of OA . A number of recent studies involving the association between obesity and knee osteoarthritis have since been published . A large , population-based prospective study ( n = 823 ) conducted by Toivanen et al . with a follow-up of 22 years found that the risk for knee osteoarthritis was 7 times greater for people with BMI ≥30 compared to the control of people with BMI 30 was significantly associated with osteoarthritis of the knee , with odds ratio of 2.81 , and 95 % CI of 1.32-5.96 . Lohmander et al . found that in a large cohort study of 27,960 patients from the Swedish population , the relative risk for knee osteoarthritis ( fourth quartile compared to first quartile ) was 8.1 , with a 95 % CI of 5.3-12.4 . Finally , a case-control study from Holliday et al . with 1,042 knee osteoarthritis patients and 1,121 matched controls reported that the adjusted odds ratio for knee osteoarthritis in patients with BMI > 30 was 7.48 with 95 % CI of 5.45-10.27 . Pain is one of the major comorbid conditions that may preclude effective weight management in these patients , particularly with regards to physical activity , since pain increases with effort and movement . Obese patients generally receive oral analgesics , such as weak opioids or tramadol , but due to a number of associated comorbidities , they generally do not tolerate , or have contraindications to , centrally acting analgesics . Furthermore an increasing number of obese patients are managed by malabsorbtive bariatric surgical procedures , exposing them at risk for inefficacity by oral analgesics , in regards to the malabsorptive effect . Therefore alternative therapies , and in particular topical treatments , may be indicated in these patients as these drugs have less systemic side effects . The use of such treatments in patients with obesity should contribute to facilitate rehabilitation and hence contribute to weight loss , which may further help to reduce pain . One promising topical treatment is represented by capsaicin . Capsaicin is an agonist of the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 ( TRPV1 ) , a non-selective cation channel . It is well established that capsaicin applied in high concentration to the skin can cause initial nociceptor sensitization through its agonistic effects on TRPV1 receptors then subsequently acts in the skin to attenuate cutaneous hypersensitivity and reduce pain by a process best described as `` defunctionalisation '' of nociceptor fibres ( e.g . temporary loss of membrane potential , inability to transport neurotrophic factors leading to altered phenotype , and reversible retraction of epidermal and dermal nerve fibre terminals ) . Evidence suggests that the utility of topical capsaicin may extend beyond painful peripheral neuropathies , and that this treatment may be particularly relevant in patients with osteoarthritis pain . Thus TRPV1 is mainly expressed by nociceptive neurons in dorsal root and trigeminal ganglia . However , there is increasing evidence that TRPV1 is also expressed in various cell types including synovial fibroblasts ( SF ) from patients with symptomatic osteoarthritis ( OA ) and thus may play a role in non-neuronal mechanisms that might modulate nociception in symptomatic osteoarthritis . An additional effect of high concentration of capsaicin , which does not involve TRPV1 , is a direct inhibition of mitochondrial respiration . Furthermore , by using the approach of patch-clamp , capsaicinoids ( capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin ) have been shown to reversibly inhibit the currents of T-type voltage-dependent Ca2+channels , suggesting the effect of capsaicinoids on pain relief may also be related to the inhibition of T-type Ca2+ channels . Capsaicin is metabolized rapidly by several cytochrome enzymes present in human liver , but in vitro studies shows that its metabolism in human skin is quite low . Capsaicin reside at the site of action ( i.e . skin ) relatively unchanged , whereas capsaicin which is transdermally absorbed is rapidly eliminated and does not have any systemic effect . To date , repeated applications of low dose capsaicin cream at different concentrations ( 0.0125 to 0.25 % ) have been found moderately effective in OA of the knee or hand , based on the basis of six double or single blind trials with sample sizes ranging from 14 to 200 patients . However repeated applications of capsaicin cream are difficult on the long term particularly because of the burning sensation induced by the cream and the necessity to repeat applications several times per day . Recently high concentration capsaicin patches ( 8 % ) ( Qutenza ) have been developed for the treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain . These treatments induce long lasting analgesic effects in these conditions lasting up to an average of 3 months after a 30 to 60 minutes application . The burning side effect related to the application of the patch is rapidly reversible and very few severe side effects have been reported with this procedure . If the primary cause of chronic musculoskeletal pain lies deep within joints and topical capsaicin does not provide substantial transdermal delivery , then the apparent efficacy of topical capsaicin in lower back pain and OA could be postulated to be by CNS modulatory mechanisms . Another possibility is that alterations in , or sensitization of , cutaneous nociceptors could be a contributing factor . Such alterations might be driven by unusually high concentrations of cytokines or growth factors in joints which could either diffuse some distance away from the primary site of inflammation or promote excitatory phenotypes in nearby collateral axons . Furthermore there is increasing evidence that TRPV1 expression is not limited to primary afferent neurons but that the receptor is expressed in various cell types throughout the body . TRPV1 is present in synovial fibroblasts from symptomatic OA and RA ( rheumatoid arthritis ) patients and the receptor can be activated by stimulation with the vanilloid capsaicin . It is very likely that capsaicin stimulation does not only induce IL-6 production but also results in the release of other signalling molecules that may transfer the information to other non-neuronal or neuronal cells and thereby contribute to a modulation of nociception in the inflamed joint . Based on the mechanisms described above , there are reasons to believe that Qutenza may also be effective in osteoarthritis pain . To date , there are strictly no data regarding potential efficacy and safety of this treatment in osteoarthritis pain in obese patients",2015-11-04,"April 15, 2019","Inclusion Criteria : Enrolled patients will be males or females , aged over 18 years , have pain for at least 3 months due to mild to moderate osteoarthritis of the knee ( meeting American College of Rheumatology clinical and radiographic criteria ) , of at least moderate intensity ( pain intensity score over the last 24 hours before enrolment ≥ 4/10 ) , with a BMI above 30 kg/m² and no other pain conditions accounting for their disability .

Alternative treatment schedules may be explored if preliminary data suggest these would be more appropriate . The effect of food on single dose PK of AZD1775 will be assessed in 12 patients . In this sub-study , patients will receive a single oral dose of AZD1775 with 240 mL of water , once in the fasted state and once following a high-fat meal .","This study will attempt to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose ( MTD ) /Recommended Phase 2 Dose ( RP2D ) of AZD1775 monotherapy when administered orally once daily ( QD ) or two times per day ( BID ) on Days 1 to 5 followed by 9 days of rest in 14-day cycles , or QD on a 5/2 dosing schedule ( 5 days on , followed by 2 days rest ) in 21-day cycles in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumours . Both the QD 5/9 and 5/2 dosing schedules will run in parallel . An evaluation will be made after the second QD cohort has been completed to determine whether to proceed with one or both dosing schedules . The AZD1775 MTD will be determined through dose-escalation using a 3+3 cohort design . If less than one-third of evaluable patients in a given cohort ( 0 of 3 patients or 1 of 6 patients ) experiences a Dose-Limiting Toxicity ( DLT ) ; escalation may proceed to the next higher dose level . If one of the first 3 patients enrolled in a given cohort experiences a DLT , 3 additional patents will be enrolled in that cohort . If a DLT is observed in one-third or more of patients , the dose at which this occurs will be considered not tolerated and the MTD will have been exceeded . The highest dose level ( s ) at which less than one-third of patients ( 0 of 3 patients or 1 of 6 patients ) experiences a DLT will be declared the MTD . Up to 6 patients will be enrolled in each cohort . Dose escalation will continue until identification of the MTD or Sponsor termination of the study . A maximum of 10 dose escalations are anticipated in the determination of MTD . Approximately 6 subjects may be added to replace non-evaluable patients . Therefore , a total of 66 patients are expected to be treated . Dose-limiting toxicities will be evaluated during Cycles 1 and 2 of treatment . If appropriate the DLT observation period can be expanded by up to 2 weeks in case of treatment delay due to study drug-related adverse events . Toxicity will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events ( NCI CTCAE ) version 4.03 . Patients must complete Cycle 1 and Cycle 2 safety evaluations which will conclude on Cycle 3 Day 1 , and must receive at least 80 % of the planned dose to be considered evaluable . Patients receiving less than 80 % of Cycle 1 and Cycle 2 dose ( 28 days ) will be replaced unless they experienced a confirmed DLT . The patient population used to determine the MTD will consist of patients who have met the minimum safety evaluation requirements of the study , and/or who have experienced a DLT in Cycle 1 or Cycle 2 . Minimum safety requirements will be met if during Cycle 1 and Cycle 2 of treatment the patient receives a minimum of 80 % of treatment doses of AZD1775 , completes the safety evaluations , and is observed for at least 28 days .

This study has a 6-week open-label treatment optimization period followed by a one week randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled test phase .","To address the unmet need for early morning ADHD symptom control , Ironshore has developed a novel drug delivery system that incorporates the active MPH ingredient in a delayed release/extended release formulation . This formulation provides a controlled , approximately 8-hour delay in initial drug release , followed by a subsequent controlled rate of drug release throughout the day . The goal of this system is to enable nighttime dosing of MPH to provide control of ADHD symptoms at the beginning of the next morning and throughout the remainder of the day . The phase 3 study used an open-label treatment-optimization phase followed by a double-blind , placebo-controlled , 1-week , parallel-group treatment phase to assess safety and tolerability , as well as the time course of treatment effect , of evening-dosed HLD200 in pediatric subjects with a diagnosis of ADHD . At Visit 2 , subjects began daily evening ( 8:00 pm ±30 minutes ) treatment with 20 or 40 mg HLD200 ( based on prior treatment history ) for a period of 1 week and then had up to 4 additional weekly visits ( Visits 3 to 6 ) for treatment adjustments to achieve both a ) an optimal daily dose and b ) an optimal treatment time prior to beginning the Double-blind Placebo-controlled Test Phase . During Visits 3 , 4 , 5 , and 6 , investigators were permitted to titrate the dose of study drug ( up or down ) in 20 to 40 mg increments until either achieving the `` optimal '' daily dose or reaching a maximum daily dose of 100 mg/day and/or a maximum dose not exceeding 3.7 mg/kg ( based on Visit 2 [ baseline ] weight ) . The final permitted dose level change was at Visit 6 , after which , that dose was to be continued through Visit 7 to randomization at Visit 8 .

Afterwards , infant 's vitals signs ( heart rate , respiratory rate , oxygen saturation ) , the neonatal infant pain scale ( NIPS ) , and salivary cortisol levels will be checked in regular intervals up to 4 hours . The NIPS is a validated pain scoring system based on the appearance of the infant . A reduction in NIPS for those infants who receive acetaminophen versus nothing will be the primary outcome to determine if the study is significant .","Male circumcision is a common surgical procedure performed in the newborn period . The American Academy of Pediatrics Task Force on Circumcision recently published an update on circumcision policy stating the benefits of male circumcision outweigh the risks . Given this update , the investigators anticipate a percentage of families who were previously undecided about circumcision will choose to have their newborn circumcised . A common concern for both parents and physicians is effective pain control . For intra-operative pain control , dorsal penile nerve block ( DPNB ) has been found to be the most effective when compared to EMLA ( lidocaine-prilocaine ) or placebo . Acetaminophen is a relatively safe , easy to administer analgesic . Prior studies have suggested that acetaminophen could be helpful in postoperative comfort .

The manufacturers of PORT-A-CATH® recommend regular flushings every 4 weeks . In clinical practice , the intervals are usually at least three months . Regular flushing might lead to a decreased risk of PORT-A-CATH® thrombosis , but may also lead to an increased infection or thrombosis rate and patients discomfort . Therefore , this study investigates the safety of not flushing the PORT-A-CATH® for 6 or 12 months .","Currently it is unknown if flushing a non-used PORT-A-CATH® every 4 weeks is a valid strategy to preserve its functioning . Even more , decision to keep the PORT-A-CATH® after completion of adjuvant therapy can not be based on profound patient information as there exist hardly any data regarding PORT-A-CATH® related complications of non-used PORT-A-CATH® .

Youngstown State University,NCT02486744,Safety and Efficacy of Acthar Gel in an Outpatient Dialysis Population,Youngstown State University,1,0,End Stage Renal Disease,Drug,Acthar Gel,Treatment,Double,"This will be a prospective observational study of Acthar Gel in Non-Diabetic Hemodialysis [ NDHD ] patients receiving dialysis for ≤ 2 years . The project will aimed at providing proof-of-concept data that 80 U two times [ 2x ] week Acthar for 6 months is a safe and effective therapy for NDHD . Effectiveness of lower dose 40 U 2X week will also be determined . Therefore the study will be a repeated measures design ( Time x condition ) comparison of improvement in renal function , nutritional status , quality of life and physical performance resulting from Acthar therapy .","Recent reports demonstrated Acthar gel is effective to induce remission of proteinuria in the Nephrotic Syndrome patients ( Bomback 2011 , 2012 ) . There are limited published reports documenting the clinical response ( creatinine , proteinuria , serum albumin and cholesterol ) to ACTHAR therapy in a non-diabetic hemodialysis population . In addition to renal dysfunction and high risk for mortality , individuals who receive dialysis also have decreased strength , low exercise capacity , poor physical functioning , and a low quality of life ( Edgell 1996 , Johansen , 2001 ) . Strength deficits are well documented in those with End Stage Renal Disease [ ESRD ] ( Cheema 2010 , Yoda 2012 ) . There are several reports documenting an association between strength and gait deficits and other measures of physical performance in persons with ESRD ( Bohannon 1994 , Fitts 1997 , Segura-Orti 2011 ) . It is well known that measures of physical performance may predict risk for fall and hospitalization in older individuals ( Guralnik JM , 2000 ) . Deficits to physical performance may be further compounded by poor nutritional status . Persons with chronic renal disease , particularly in the context of hemodialysis or chronic renal replacement therapy , are often malnourished and/or are affected by abnormal micronutrient status ( McMahon 2012 ) . Furthermore , previous studies have shown that more than a third of acute-care , nephrology-related admissions are characterized by malnutrition ( Lim 2012 ) , and that it affects from 23 % - 76 % of all patients receiving hemodialysis ( including outpatients ) ( Blumenkrantz 1980 , Ikizler 1996 , Pecoits-Filho 2002 ) . Decreased functional status and concomitant malnutrition contribute to increased hospital readmissions , prolonged length of stay ( and inevitably , increased medical costs ) , and increased morbidity and mortality patients ( Isabel 2003 , Lim 2012 ) . Given the high prevalence of these characteristics in persons with renal disease , it is important to prioritize identification of novel and effective means by which to sustain and improve the functional capability of these patients , and to maintain their nutritional status and attenuate malnutrition . To date , there are no reports of the impact of Acthar gel therapy on renal function , strength , physical performance , nutritional status and quality of life in NDHD patients . This study will determine if Acthar gel therapy will maintain or improve overall kidney function as measured with 24 hour urine study at baseline and at the end of study period . In addition this study will determine if Acthar gel therapy will improve nutritional , physical and biochemical status in an outpatient non-diabetic hemodialysis population .",2015-06-08,"February 8, 2017","Inclusion Criteria : Inclusion criteria will be individuals requiring dialysis for treatment of ESRD who have had poor response to immunosuppressive strategies .

Symptoms may include : dull aching , cramping , itching or tingling in the calves , swelling , redness or any colour changes as well as thickening of the skin in the lower limbs . The most common indication of CVI is dilated veins known as varicose veins . CVI is a disorder found more commonly in females . Conventional treatments for CVI include vein ligation or stripping , elastic compression , valve reconstruction and sclerotherapy venous bypass . Amongst other treatment , exercise has also proven to be effective in improving CVI as it increases circulation , by increasing blood returning to the heart . A variety of herbal supplements have been proven to be safe and effective in the treatment of CVI . Red vine leaf extract has also been proven to be useful in the treatment of CVI . Previous studies on the red vine leaf extract have shown that it is an effective and safe treatment of CVI . Studies done on horse chestnut extract have stated that the extract increases venous tone and decreases capillary permeability . Butcher 's broom extract has been proven to be effective in the treatment of CVI .

University of Johannesburg,NCT02481973,The Effect of Individualised Homoeopathic Treatment Using the Grant Bentley Method in Premenstrual Syndrome,University of Johannesburg,2,1,Premenstrual Syndrome,Other,Individualised Homoeopathic Remedy,Treatment,,"Premenstrual syndrome ( PMS ) is related to the changes in the levels of hormones predominately progesterone , oestrogen and prolactin , during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle . Both physical and psychological symptoms may occur from at least day 14 of the menstruation cycle and cease by day 4 of menstruation . The symptoms may interfere with a female 's daily activities and have a negative impact well-being . There are a number of conventional pharmacological drugs which are used in the treatment or alleviation of the symptoms of PMS , however the drugs may have side effects and may negatively interact with other medications . Research has shown that homoeopathy is beneficial in relieving or decreasing the severity of PMS , however finding the individualised homoeopathic remedy can be difficult . Grant Bentley developed a system that helps find the most suitable remedy for each individual case . The Grant Bentley Method ( GBM ) uses homoeopathic case taking , photographs of the facial features and repertorisation to determine the dominant miasmatic group of the patient . This aids in the selection of specific homoeopathic remedy . There has been no research to show the effect of the GBM on PMS . This study aims to determine the effect of individualised homoeopathic treatment using the GBM , on females with PMS by using case studies and a daily self-grading PMS chart .","The study is of an embedded mixed method design using the PMS chart and case studies and will take place over 12 weeks at the University of Johannesburg ( UJ ) Health Centre . Using purposive sampling , 10 female participants between the ages of 18 to 40 years will be recruited by means of advertisements at the Homoeopathic Health Centre , campus gym and female residences on the Doornfontein campus of the University of Johannesburg , as well as various health shops , practices and gyms in the Auckland Park and Killarney areas , with the relevant permission granted . Each potential participant will be required to complete a screening questionnaire in order to establish whether they are an appropriate candidate for this study . Once this is confirmed , the researcher will explain the study to each participant . The participants will be required to read the participant information form and sign the consent and medical photograph consent forms . Participants will be informed that their photographs will be used for facial analysis to assist in finding the most accurate remedy and will not be published . Each participant 's facial features will be hand-drawn by the researcher in order to aid participant confidentiality . Each participant will undergo a full homoeopathic consultation which will focus on her PMS symptoms . In addition , 9 photos of their facial features will be taken with a digital camera ( Panasonic DMC-FZ5 ) for classification of their dominant miasmatic group . Thereafter , a physical examination including vital signs and an abdominal and/or breast examination ( if indicated ) will be conducted . After the consultation , the participant will be asked to record their daily PMS symptoms , for a period of 1 month , on the PMS chart ( provided to them by the researcher ) at home . The first month will act as a baseline measurement as no treatment will be prescribed . Additionally , the researcher will analyse and repertorise the participant 's case in this period . The participant will be grouped into their dominant miasmatic group and the corresponding remedy will be selected , according to the principles of homoeopathy and GBM of prescribing , for use in the following consultation . Remedy selections will be supervised by a registered homoeopath . The follow-up consultations will be conducted at weeks 4 , 8 and 12 , wherein participants will hand in their completed PMS charts and undergo any relevant physical examinations . The participant will then receive their individualised remedy , as determined by the researcher , along with an explanation as to how to store and take the remedy . They will additionally receive another PMS chart to complete over the following 4 weeks . Photographs may be retaken to re-analysed the case if necessary as to ensure the correct selection of the remedy using the GBM during the study . Should the participant want further treatment at the completion of the study , they will be appropriately referred to a registered homoeopath or to the UJ Homoeopathic Health Centre . A positive result of this research would indicate the viability of the GBM as a useful tool to aid in the individualised homoeopathic treatment and therefore aid in successful prescribing in the treatment of PMS . Additionally , a positive result would indicate homoeopathy as a potential treatment for PMS .",2015-06-04,"May 18, 2016","Inclusion Criteria : Females ( aged 18-40 ) suffering from at least one PMS symptom from both of the following physical and psychological symptoms , for at least 3 consecutive menstrual cycles : Physical symptoms : headache , breast tenderness , abdominal bloating , food cravings and swelling of extremities Psychological symptoms : depression , anxiety , irritability , social withdrawal and memory changes ; symptoms that are present from at least day 14 ( 2 weeks before menstruation ) of the menstrual cycle , are relieved by day 4 of menstruation , and do not reoccur until after day 13 of the menstrual cycle ; and if currently on the OCP , they must be using the same brand of medication for 3 consecutive months .

Universitaire Ziekenhuizen KU Leuven,NCT02602210,Supplemental Corticosteroids in Cirrhotic Hypotensive Patients With Suspicion of Sepsis,Universitaire Ziekenhuizen KU Leuven,3,0,Liver Cirrhosis,Drug,Hydrocortisone,Treatment,Triple,"The main goal of the study is to investigate the clinical relevance , efficacy and safety of treating hypotensive cirrhotic patients with suspicion of sepsis and on vasopressors with low-dose hydrocortisone in order to reverse hemodynamic instability and organ failure and to decrease mortality .","Ample evidence suggests that a significant number of patients ( 52-77 % ) with chronic liver disease develop adrenal insufficiency in case of concomitant sepsis . This condition impairs hemodynamic integrity and probably worsens often encountered multiorgan failure . Different groups suggested that treating those patients with corticosteroids gives a faster reversal of hemodynamic instability and even lowers mortality compared to historical controls . However , most of the published data are retrospective and comprise small groups of patients . These data raise the possibility that corticosteroids at stress doses may be beneficial in hypotensive cirrhotics admitted to the ICU but as yet this has not been subjected to a large-scale multicentre randomized controlled clinical trial . The study will be a double-blind , randomized , placebo-controlled , multicenter trial , involving tertiary intensive care units with expertise in management of patients with decompensated cirrhosis .

"Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati",NCT02607124,"A Phase I/II Study of Ribociclib,a CDK4/6 Inhibitor, Following Radiation Therapy","Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati",1,0,High Grade Glioma,Drug,Ribociclib,Treatment,,"In this research study the investigators want to learn more about the effects , both good and bad , when the study drug Ribociclib is given after radiation therapy . The investigators are asking people to be in this research study that have been newly diagnosed with a high grade glioma , and the tumor has been screened for the Rb1 protein , and have recently finished radiation therapy . Patients with a DIPG or a Bi-thalamic high grade glioma do not need to have tumor tissue screened for the Rb1 protein but do need to have finished radiation therapy . Tumor cells grow and divide quickly . In normal cells , there are proteins called cyclin-dependent kinases ( CDK 4 and 6 ) that control cell division . Another protein Rb1 also controls cell division and works to stop cells from dividing so they do not become cancer cells . But in cancer , the CDK 4 and 6 proteins are out of control making the cells divide and grow quickly . The study drug , ribociclib stops the CDK 4 and 6 proteins . When the CDK 4 and 6 proteins are stopped , the normal Rb1 protein can now work to slow cell growth . For patients with HGG , to be in this study tumor tissue must have a normal Rb1 protein . The researchers think that if the study drug is given soon after radiation therapy , it may help improve the effect of the radiation in stopping the tumor from growing . The study drug , Ribociclib is considered investigational as it has not yet been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration . The study drug has been tested in children and adults with cancer in prior research studies .","Ribociclib has shown an acceptable toxicity profile in adults and pediatrics . Available data suggests that over 70 % of DIPG patient have an intact RB and 90 % HGG patients have expression of RB , therefore CDK4/6 inhibition is a suitable target . Given the dismal prognosis for children with DIPG and HGG , it is appropriate to evaluate the long term feasibility and early efficacy of Ribociclib following radiation therapy in patients with RB+ tumors . The aim of the upfront biopsy molecular studies proposed is to identify subgroups of patients who will benefit from the use of checkpoint inhibitors in the setting of intact RB pathway . This study will play a major role in moving the field of DIPG/HGG research forward as the investigators intend to reveal feasibility of upfront stereotactic biopsy and specific pathway directed therapy following radiation therapy with the ultimate goal to add additional targeted therapy in combination with Ribociclib resulting in improving the outcome for patients diagnosed with these fatal tumors . The current proposal will be a novel pediatric study to obtain biopsy in DIPG prior to therapy and administer molecularly targeted therapy following radiation therapy in children with newly diagnosed DIPG and HGG . In this study , the investigators will assess the assess long-term feasibility and early efficacy of Ribociclib administered daily for 3 weeks and off one week every 28 days following radiation therapy for at least 6 courses and up to 12 courses in patients with newly-diagnosed non-biopsied DIPG and RB+ biopsied DIPG and HGG .

Investigators know that mucus is a factor in severe asthma attacks . However , mucus may be a factor in chronic severe asthma as well . This role has been hard to prove because of difficulty in showing that mucus occludes the lumen in chronic severe disease . Using a novel approach of scoring mucus occlusion , investigators have used CT imaging to uncover that a majority of people with severe asthma have at least one lung segment with a mucus plug and 27 % have more than four lung segments with mucus plugs . Historically , studies of mucolytics , like NAC , have not shown benefit in other obstructive lung diseases , like COPD . However , utilizing CT mucus scores as a biomarker , investigators believe that mucolytic treatment may prove useful for those with significant mucus impaction . This is a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled phase 4 study of 20 % NAC in patients with asthma who also have evidence of mucus in their lungs as determined by CT imaging .

Insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes ( T2DM ) is associated with endothelial dysfunction and vascular inflammation . Thus strategies to improve insulin sensitivity and lower glucotoxicity may improve endothelial inflammation and vascular inflammation . However , the effects of these agents on vascular inflammation and endothelial function is not known in patients with type 2 diabetes although anti-inflammatory properties have been demonstrated in various animal models . In the present study the investigators will assess if dapagliflozin treatment for 12 weeks decreases monocyte inflammation and improves endothelial function in patients with type 2 diabetes on metformin monotherapy .","The insulin-resistant state of type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) is largely mediated by inflammatory pathways affecting skeletal muscle which is the primary site of whole body insulin resistance . Nuclear factor kappa B ( NFkappaB ) regulates pro-inflammatory cytokines which ultimately impair skeletal muscle insulin signaling and fatty acid oxidation ; its activity reflects overall inflammatory tone in skeletal muscle . Recent human studies confirm that NFkappaB is elevated in the skeletal muscle of T2DM human subjects . Furthermore , the same inflammatory processes and signaling impairments contribute to worsening endothelial dysfunction , which is an independent predictor for future cardiovascular events in T2DM . In addition , these SGLT-2 Inhibitors reduce body weight , visceral adiposity , systolic and diastolic blood pressure , microalbuminuria , and oxidative stress . However , there are no studies examining the effects of SGLT-2 inhibitor therapy on NFkappaB and other inflammatory mediators in humans with T2DM . Moreover , no studies have examined the effect of SGLT-2 inhibitor therapy on endothelial function in this population .

Patients will be randomized to receive either a placebo suppository or bisacodyl suppository dosed every other day for 4 weeks .,"The majority of patients with multiple sclerosis ( MS ) suffer from some form of anorectal dysfunction , and these difficulties with bowel function are often ranked as negatively impactful on quality of life as impaired mobility . Despite the significant clinical burden of these symptoms , there remains a paucity of published literature supporting specific therapeutic options to manage anorectal dysfunction in this clinical population . Most bowel regimens rely on either oral laxatives ( i.e . PEG-3350 ) or anti-diarrheal agents ( i.e . loperamide ) . In their study , the investigators propose to establish the efficacy of a bowel regimen that combines both oral agents ( as needed ; standard care ) with scheduled , every other day dosing of a placebo or stimulant laxative rectal suppository -- bisacodyl 10 mg.

Incidence of synechiae formation varies in literature and ranges between 4-35 % . Presence of middle meatal synechiae can impair sinus drainage , promote sinusitis , and limit endoscopic visualization of the sinus cavities postoperatively . This may result in difficulty in performing postoperative routine endoscopic debridement and examination , which is paramount to a successful outcome from ESS . Spacers are often inserted during surgery between nasal mucosal surfaces to prevent synechiae .

Synechiae formation in the middle meatus is the most common complication of endoscopic sinus surgery . Synechiae describes the adhesion of two opposing mucosal surfaces in the nasal cavity that can cause scarring and obstruction of the nasal passage . Incidence of synechiae formation varies in literature and ranges between 4-35 % . Presence of middle meatal synechiae can impair sinus drainage , promote sinusitis , and limit endoscopic visualization of the sinus cavities postoperatively . This may result in difficulty in performing postoperative routine endoscopic debridement and examination , which is paramount to a successful outcome from ESS . To prevent synechiae formation , numerous studies have been published evaluating the effectiveness of absorbable and non-absorbable spacers placed in the middle meatus for 1-2 weeks postoperatively . The spacer is meant to prevent contact between the denuded surfaces of the middle turbinate and the lateral nasal wall during re-epithelialization . In general , non-resorbable spacers that have been used include sponges , cotton gauze and plastic sheets . Of these , Silastic Silicone sheets have been used in a number of hospitals across the US and Canada . Lee and Baguley have demonstrated the effectiveness of Silastic spacers in reducing the risk of synechiae formation to between 0-6 % . There are also a number of resorbable spacers that are in use , which are preferred by some physicians because there is minimal need to remove the packing materials as they naturally are removed or resorbed during the healing period . In a recent meta-analysis , Lee et al has revealed that usage of middle meatal spacers ( absorbable and non-absorbable ) did not decrease the rate of synechiae formation to a statistically significant degree compared to not using any spacer . However , when subgroup analysis was performed , non-absorbable spacer usage demonstrated a statistically significant lower incidence of synechiae compared to no spacers . This can be explained in part by an inherent capability of the absorbable spacer material to degrade to smaller size particulates that , if caught in the healing tissue , could illicit local inflammatory response to slow down the healing and cause further synechiae formation . This mechanism was demonstrated by Maccabee et al in a rabbit model , where fibers of the absorbable spacer became incorporated into healing mucosa and increased the extent of the inflammatory response and formation of fibrosis . To improve outcomes , physicians have attempted to load steroids such as Triamcinolone and antibiotics such as Neosporin into nasal packing and/or stents . However , residence of the drug in the intended treatment space is minimized as the drug , which is not bound to the spacer , quickly releases and may not remain long enough to impact inflammatory response . A Mometasone Furoate coated stent ( Propel™ ) , manufactured by Intersect ENT , is currently the only drug coated nasal stent that has a claim of longer sustained release . In a randomized , controlled , double-blind trial , Marple et al found that this Mometasone Furoate steroid-eluting bio-absorbable stent could significantly improve postoperative outcomes compared to a non-steroid eluting placebo arm with the same stent . Zhao et al conducted a systematic review of the efficacy of this steroid-eluting stent ( Propel ) vs inert ( both resorbable and non-resorbable ) spacers and again confirmed that there are lower rates of synechiae formation in the steroid-eluting treatment groups . However , anecdotal evidence , based on discussion with a number of surgeons in the field , suggests that a drug-loaded resorbable spacer may be subject to the same issues as non-drug-loaded resorbable spacers , namely late stage degradation of the material that can cause a secondary spike of the inflammatory cascade , requiring additional surgical intervention to remove the remaining debris . Therefore , it has been hypothesized that a steroid eluting non-absorbable spacer may provide optimal benefit for the patient 's outcome . The Restora™ spacer is made of a biocompatible non-resorbable material that is expected to deliver up to 370 µg of Mometasone Furoate . The steroid elutes out of the spacer and onto the surrounding mucosal tissue during the 6-8 day period during which it is retained . This study is designed to evaluate basic device usability and confirm safety and effectiveness of the Restora™ Steroid eluting spacer as compared to the standard of care Silastic Silicone spacer .",2015-12-07,"October 23, 2017","Inclusion Criteria : Age between 18 and 75 years Diagnosis of chronic rhinosinusitis ( CRS ) , per current guidelines Patients who need to undergo primary bilateral complete endoscopic sinus surgery Subject has the ability to follow the study instructions , is willing to be available on the specific required study visit days , and is willing to complete all study visit procedures and assessments Subject must understand the research nature of this study and sign an informed consent prior to the performance of any study-specific procedure or assessment Exclusion Criteria : Subject is pregnant or breast feeding Patients with sino-nasal tumors Patients solely undergoing nasal septal reconstruction Patients with previous history of endoscopic sinus surgery Cystic fibrosis or syndromic patients Patients with autoimmune diseases Patients who have taken oral steroids less than 30 days prior to surgery Patients with a history or diagnosis of glaucoma or ocular hypertension Any other circumstance or condition that in the Investigator 's opinion causes the subject to be an inappropriate candidate for participating in this study",3,0,18 Years,75 Years

Duke University,NCT02620579,Biopsychosocial Influence on Shoulder Pain,Duke University,2,1,Shoulder Pain,Drug,Propranolol LA (60 mg),Treatment,Triple,"Chronic shoulder pain is a common , costly , and disabling problem for society . The identification of factors predictive of the development of chronic shoulder pain is necessary to develop innovative and effective treatments to reduce the societal impact of shoulder disorders . In previous work the investigators identified a genetic and psychological subgroup that robustly predicted heightened shoulder pain responses in a pre-clinical cohort and poor 12 month shoulder pain recovery rates in a clinical surgical cohort . In this follow-up study the investigator proposes to test how interventions tailored to the high risk subgroup affect pain responses in a pre-clinical cohort . The optimal theorized match for the identified high-risk subgroup is a combination of personalized pharmaceutical and education interventions . This combined personalized intervention versus a placebo pharmaceutical and general education intervention group is the primary comparison of interest . Also , an evaluation of the individual effect of personalized pharmaceutical and educational interventions will be part of the study . Such comparisons will provide important information on what the active portion of the combined personalized intervention may be .","Potential subjects will be screened and those meeting the high-risk criteria based on COMT genotype for high pain sensitivity and pain catastrophizing questionnaire score will be eligible for randomization into intervention groups ( stratified by sex ) . Exercise induced shoulder injury will serve as the pain generating mechanism on Day 1 and participants will receive pharmaceutical and education interventions over Days 1-4 , and Days 2-4 respectively . Statistical analysis will determine whether the combined personalized intervention group experienced shorter shoulder pain duration , lower peak pain intensity , or decreased upper-extremity disability and determine which molecular , psychological , and pain sensitivity regulation mechanisms are associated with pain relief . A preliminary analysis is planned after the first 300 subjects are equally randomized to the 4 intervention groups . The comparison of interest for the preliminary analysis is the combined personalized intervention group with the placebo and general education group for the primary outcome . Depending on the results of this preliminary analysis the randomization pattern may change , with details of these changes available in the protocol paper .",2015-11-13,"December 20, 2022","Inclusion Criteria : English speaking Exclusion Criteria : chronic pain ( > 3 months ) in any area , currently experiencing neck or shoulder pain , previous history of neck or shoulder pain ( operationally defined as experiencing neck or shoulder pain for longer than 48 hours or seeking medical treatment for neck or shoulder pain ) , neurological impairment of the in the upper-extremity ( determined by loss of sensation , muscle weakness , and reflex changes ) , regular participation in upper-extremity weight training , currently or regular use of pain medication , and previous history of upper-extremity surgery .

The objective of the study was to determine the dosage regimen of netazepide , a gastrin/CCK2 receptor antagonist , required to inhibit the trophic effects of PPI-induced hypergastrinaemia . Six groups of 8 healthy subjects participated in a randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled exploratory study of esomeprazole 40 mg daily for 28 days , and netazepide 1 , 5 or 25 mg , or placebo daily during the last 14 days of esomeprazole dosing , or 14 days after esomeprazole withdrawal . Serum gastrin and plasma chromogranin A ( CgA ) were measured regularly from study start until at least 1 week after the last dose . Dyspepsia was monitored after esomeprazole withdrawal .","Non-clinical studies have shown that PPI-induced hypergastrinaemia leads to rebound gastric hyperacidity after PPI withdrawal . A gastrin/CCK2 receptor antagonist inhibits that response . Studies in healthy subjects and patients also suggest that PPI withdrawal leads to rebound hyperacidity , but the evidence is controversial . However , there is better evidence from studies in healthy subjects that PPI withdrawal can lead to dyspepsia . The principal aims of this study were : to assess the effect of different dose regimens of netazepide on the increases in circulating gastrin and CgA induced by esomeprazole in healthy subjects ; and to choose a dose regimen for future studies of esomeprazole withdrawal in patients . The secondary aims were : to assess if omeprazole withdrawal leads to dyspepsia , and if so whether it can be prevented by netazepide ; and to assess the likelihood of an interaction between esomeprazole and netazepide . Gastrin and CgA are biomarkers of acid suppression and increased ECL-cell activity , respectively . This was a randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel-group , pilot study , in which six groups of eight healthy subjects took esomeprazole 40 mg daily for 28 days , and netazepide 1 , 5 or 25 mg , or placebo , daily during the last 14 days of esomeprazole dosing , or the 14 days immediately following esomeprazole withdrawal ( 25 mg only ) .

Mixed effects regression models are used to take into account the correlation structure between measures in time . Crude and adjusted odds-ratios with corresponding 95 % confidence intervals are calculated .","BACKGROUND . Parenteral nutrition associated cholestasis ( PNAC ) is a common complication of prolonged and exclusive parenteral nutrition ( PN ) . PNAC in neonates and infants is multifactorial , including the underlying pathology and the effect of certain PN nutrients . In preterm infants , hepatic immaturity is itself , a predisposing factor . Infants subjected to major surgery are often unable to receive enteral nutrition for a long period of time , during which they require exclusive PN . After that , enteral nutrition is slowly introduced alongside with the reduction of the PN . In major surgery for congenital malformations of the digestive tract , additional risk factors for PNAC are the absence of enteral nutrition , intestinal bacterial translocation and sepsis . Jejunal atresia and gastroschisis are independent risk factors for PNAC . In short bowel syndrome , changes in the bile acids enterohepatic cycle may also contribute to PNAC . Intravenous lipid emulsions ( ILE ) used in PN may promote PNAC or protect against it depending on their composition . Phytosterols contained in ILE have been implicated in PNAC in newborns by disrupting bile-acid homeostasis . High intakes of soy-based fatty acids ( FA ) n-6 from ILE , especially palmitate , may contribute to PNAC since these are precursors of arachidonic acid , a pro-inflammatory mediator . Medium chain triglycerides ( MCT ) may have a hepatic protective effect . Hence , ILE containing relatively high amounts of MCT , such as Lipofundin® ( B. Braun ) theoretically might be advantageous in protecting against PNAC . Long chain triglycerides ( LCT ) of n-3 family may protect from PNAC thorough its anti-inflammatory activity . The Omegaven® ( Fresenius Kabi ) , exclusively based on LCT n-3 has proved to prevent and reverse PNAC in neonates . In several new-generation emulsions , including SMOFlipid® ( Fresenius Kabi ) , the reported α-tocopherol content is up to 4- to 5-fold higher than the alpha-tocopherol content of soy-oil emulsions . The α-tocopherol isoform acts as an antioxidant , preventing lipid peroxidation attributable to the high content of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid ( LC-PUFA ) . The ILE Lipofundin® ( B Braun ) , is composed of 50 % LCT ( soybean oil ) and 50 % MCT ( coconut oil ) . The other new generation ILE SMOFlipid® ( Fresenius Kabi ) is composed of 30 % LCT n-6 ( soybean oil ) , 30 % MCT ( coconut oil ) , 25 % monounsaturated fatty acids ( olive oil ) , 15 % LCT n-3 ( fish oil ) and α-tocopherol . A systematic review found lower bilirubin levels in children with intestinal failure and other conditions receiving parenteral n-3 ILE compared with n-6 ILE . However , it was concluded that current data is insufficient to support the use of parenteral n-3 ILE in children , suggesting further trials examining long-term clinical outcomes and harms . Among several studies comparing the effect of different ILEs in PNAC in children , only the retrospective study by Pischler et al . ( 2014 ) compared SMOFlipid® with Lipofundin® . This study included 127 children aged 0-16 years , including 34 premature infants and 59 children with surgical conditions , including necrotizing enterocolitis . Until 2011 only Lipofundin® had been used for PN in the the medical-surgical neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU ) of the Hospital Dona Estefânia . The further availability of SMOFlipid® led the investigators to compare the effect of both ILE on the liver tests associated with PNAC of neonates subjected to corrective surgery for major congenital abnormalities , since to the best of our knowledge no prospective study has made this comparison specifically in this population . OBJECTIVE . To compare the incidence and severity of PNAC in term and near-term infants subjected to corrective surgery for congenital abnormalities and needing prolonged PN using the ILE SMOFlipid® or Lipofundin® . The investigators hypothesise that the use of SMOFlipid® may be more protective from PNAC than Lipofundin . METHODS . Design : single-center , randomized , controlled and double-blinded trial : prescribing physicians were unaware of the type of ILE administered and the pharmacist who prepared and randomized the individuals to the interventions was not aware of the liver status of the participants . Simple randomization was performed by the same pharmacist ( MLR ) using a computer generated random number table . Were considered eligible every consecutive neonate admitted in the NICU , with gestational age of 34 weeks or over , requiring corrective surgery of congenital anomaly of the digestive tract or indirectly affecting the digestive tract ( eg , diaphragmatic hernia ) . Recruitment occurred in the first 48 hours after birth , if PN with ILE was initiated within the first 48 hours after birth . Main variables recorded : Weekly measurement of serum : total bilirubin , conjugated bilirubin , GGT , alanine -aminotransferase ( ALT ) and aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) , alkaline phosphatase and triglycerides . Daily parenteral lipid intake ( g/Kg ) Reasons for reducing or stopping ILE Secondary variables recorded : Gestational age , birth weight , prenatal diagnosis of congenital abnormalities Main and secondary diagnoses Major surgery ( date/ day of life ) Events , especially infectious events ( date/ day of life ) Enteral feeding initiation ( date/ day of life ) Enteral feeding : type of feeding and mode of administration . The percent of enteral intake in relation to daily fluid intake was recorded ( date/ day of life ) : 0-50 % and full enteral feeding . Daily weight ( g ) Weekly length ( cm ) and head circumference ( cm ) Weekly or every 2 weeks measurement of serum : total blood count , ionogram , calcium , phosphorus and magnesium Potential confounders affecting the liver function : Sepsis according to described criteria Phenobarbital for treatment abstinence syndrome secondary to sedative and analgesic drugs used during the postsurgical period Use of ursodeoxycholic acid Parenteral nutrition protocol based on the National Consensus for Neonatal PN . Whenever possible PN with ILE is initiated within the first 24 hours after birth . As the Pharmacy Service of the Hospital is not available for preparing individualized PN during weekends , infants admitted during this period have initiated a standard solution containing only glucose , calcium and aminoacids . Thereafter , all patients receive a similar aminoacid , glucose , electrolyte and vitamins PN solution plus ILE ( SMOFlipid® or Lipofundin® ) . ILE is reduced to 0.5-1.5g/kg/d if : Hypertriglyceridemia ( > 250 mg / dL ) Hyperglycemia ( > 150 mg / dL ) Unconjugated bilirubin > 12 mg/dL Acute phase of sepsis Pulmonary hypertension If cholestasis appeared , ILE is restricted to 2-2.5 g/kg/d , the amino acids restricted to 2-2.5 g/kg/d and glucose limited to 12 mg/kg/minute Enteral nutrition protocol is the same in both groups . Minimal enteral feeding is initiated when bowel sounds are audible , and significant abdominal distention and bilious or bloody gastric residuals are absent . Initially , feeds are administered continuously , and changed to bolus feeding as soon as infants can tolerate it . Mother 's milk is preferred . However , depending on the patient 's condition semi-elemental ( Pepti-Junior® , Danone ) or elemental formula ( Neocate® , Nutricia ) may be preferred . Later on , these formulas are replaced with mother 's milk as soon as tolerated , or if mother 's milk is insufficient or unavailable , preterm formula ( Miltina Prem® , Humana GmbH , Germany ) may be used in preterms or infant formula ( Nan 1® , Nestlé ) in full-term infants . Data collection and storage : Excel® calculation table ( Microsoft Office 2007® ) . Statistical analysis with the support of the Research Unit of Centro Hospitalar de Lisboa Central . Categorical data were presented as frequencies ( percentages ) , and continuous variables as mean and standard deviation ( SD ) or median and inter-quartile range ( 25th percentile-75th percentile ) , as appropriate . Mixed effects regression models were used to take into account the correlation structure between measures in time . Crude and adjusted odds-ratios with corresponding 95 % confidence intervals were calculated . The level of significance was α = 0.05 . Data analysis was performed using the software SPSS 22.0 ( SPSS for Windows , Rel . 22.0.1 . 2013 . SPSS Inc. , Chicago , Il , EUA ) and Stata ( StataCorp . 2013 . Stata Statistical Software : Release 13 . College Station , TX : StataCorp LP. ) . Measures of outcome : Cholestasis and cholestasis severity incidence rates and associated 95 % confidence intervals will be accessed for each intervention group . Cholestasis and severe cholestasis incidence rates will be compared by calculating relative risks and the Number Needed to Harm ( NNH ) in association with their 95 % confidence intervals . Relative efficacy measures ( hazard ratios ) and possibly odds ratios will be used if group homogeneity is found .

Boston Children's Hospital,NCT02633241,A Pilot Study of Dexmedetomidine-Propofol in Children Undergoing Magnetic Resonance Imaging,Joseph Cravero,4,1,Epilepsy,Drug,Dexmedetomidine bolus and high infusion-Propofol,Health Services Research,,This is a pilot study to determine if a standard bolus dose and infusion of dexmedetomidine can significantly decrease the dose of propofol ( infusion ) required for accomplishing an MRI . The investigators studied three arms to examine the effectiveness of dexmedetomidine . Arm 1 was a single bolus of 1.0 mcg/kg with 1.0 mcg/kg/hr infusion followed by propofol infusion . Arm 2 was a bolus of 1.0 mcg/kg with 0.5 mcg/kg/hr infusion followed by propofol infusion . Arm 3 was only a single bolus of 1.0 mcg/kg with no infusion followed by propofol infusion .,"A recent publication in the New England Journal of Medicine highlighted the accumulating evidence for neurotoxic effects of anesthetics in animal models and a collection of epidemiologic studies in humans . Recent studies of anesthesia in fetal and neonatal primates are yielding more evidence of neurotoxicity associated with many common anesthesia and sedation techniques ( e.g . propofol , etomidate , sevoflurane , desflurane and isoflurane ) . On the other hand , the data suggests that some alternative sedative agents , such as Dexmedetomidine , may not have the same neurotoxic effect . Children routinely undergo sedation for MRI scanning with large doses of propofol and other sedatives . Many of these scans occur at young ages when these children may be at risk of neurological injury from sedative exposure . In addition , these scans do not involve any stimulation - which could be protective against neurodegeneration . The investigators propose a pilot study to determine if a standard bolus dose and infusion of dexmedetomidine can significantly decrease the dose of propofol ( infusion ) required for accomplishing an MRI . Based on previous work with the combination of propofol with dexmedetomidine for other procedures , the investigators propose a standard dose of dexmedetomidine ( 1 mcg/kg bolus followed by an infusion at 1.0 mcg/kg/hour , 0.5 mcg/kg/hour , or no infusion ) . The investigators will augment this sedation with propofol 2-3 mg/kg titrated bolus followed by 100 mcg/kg/min infusion which can also be titrated up or down to a maximum of 300 mcg/kg/min to keep the blood pressure and heart rate within 30 % of baseline levels ) . The investigators hypothesize that the use of low dose propofol with dexmedetomidine will be effective undergoing MRI while sparing exposure to the high dose of the sedative .",2015-12-11,"June 23, 2023","Inclusion Criteria : Subjects presenting as out-patients , scheduled to receive an anesthetic for MRI of body ( spine , chest , abdomen , and/or pelvis ) and/or extremity ( arm and/or leg ) .

Bulent Ecevit University,NCT02632981,IL-32 Levels in Patients With Chronic Periodontitis,Bulent Ecevit University,1,1,Periodontitis,Other,nonsurgical periodontal treatment,Diagnostic,Quadruple,Interleukin-32 ( IL-32 ) is a recently described cytokine that is a strong inducer of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) -α . A previous report have reported that Porphyromonas gingivalis-derived LPS significantly up-regulated IL-32 expression compared with the unstimulated cells in monocytes ( THP-1 cells ) . They suggested that IL-32 may contribute to the pathogenesis of periodontal disease . In the present study the investigators hypothesized that IL-32 levels may increase in the gingival crevicular fluid ( GCF ) and saliva of patients with chronic periodontitis compared with healthy controls and these levels may decrease together with treatment .,"The purpose of this study was to investigate IL-32 levels in the GCF and saliva of patients with chronic periodontitis and to evaluate changes after nonsurgical periodontal therapy . Twenty-seven CP and 27 periodontally healthy controls were enrolled in this study . Periodontitis patients received nonsurgical periodontal treatment . GCF and saliva sampling and clinical periodontal parameters were assessed before and a month after treatment . IL-32 , IL-10 and TNF-α levels in GCF and saliva were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay . Unstimulated salivary samples were collected using standard techniques . About 2 mL whole saliva was collected in disposable tubes and centrifuged immediately to remove cell debris ( 10,000 g x 10 minutes ) . The supernatants ( 50µL each ) were stored at -40C until analyzed . GCF samples were collected from a mesio-buccal and disto-palatal site on each tooth . In the CP group , the samples were obtained from patients at areas with ≥5 mm CAL , ≥6 mm PD and ≥30 % bone loss . In the healthy group , GCF samples were collected from teeth exhibiting PD < 3 mm without CAL and BOP . The area was isolated with cotton rolls , saliva contamination elimination was ensured , and it was slightly air dried . GCF was sampled with paper strips . Paper strips were placed into the crevice until mild resistance was felt ( intracrevicular method ) and left in the position for 30 seconds . Strips contaminated with blood or saliva were discarded .

St. Justine's Hospital,NCT02638506,RCT Evaluating Intranasal Fentanyl in the Pain Management of Children With Headaches,St. Justine's Hospital,4,0,Headaches,Drug,Fentanyl,Treatment,Quadruple,"Background : Headaches are a common presentation for children consulting to the Emergency Department ( ED ) . However , only few studies have evaluated the rapid pain improvement provided by medications in the acute management of headaches in the pediatric population . Objective : To evaluate pain reduction provided by intranasal fentanyl ( INF ) compared to placebo in addition to ibuprofen for children presenting to a pediatric ED with moderate to severe headaches . Methods : A single-center , double-blind , randomized , placebo controlled clinical trial will be conducted in an urban , university-affiliated , tertiary care pediatric hospital ED . All children eight to 18 years old who will present to the ED with headaches as a main chief complaint and with pain of ≥ 36 mm out of 100 on Visual Analog Scale ( VAS ) will be recruited . Study participants will be randomly allocated to receive INF 1.5 mcg/kg ( maximum dose of 100 mcg ) or similar volume of a placebo solution via an atomizer . Co-administration of oral ibuprofen 10 mg/kg ( maximum dose of 600 mg ) will also be provided to the two groups if not received in the previous 4 hours . The primary outcome will be the mean pain rating reduction at 15 minutes . The secondary outcomes will be mean pain reduction at 30 and 60 minutes , patient 's and parental satisfaction levels , percent of being pain free , sedation score , immediate and within 72 hours adverse events , additional ED analgesics and other medications , length of ED stay , disposition outcomes , hospital admission rate and ED revisit rate within 72 hours . The primary analysis will use an intention-to-treat approach to compare mean pain score reduction between the two groups using a Student 's T-test . The sample size of 60 participants per arm was calculated to have a power of 80 % to identify a difference of 10 mm in the VAS . Expected results : Our study might demonstrate that INF provides additional pain relief for children presenting to an ED with headaches . Providing INF could relieve their symptoms more quickly , potentially improve patient 's and family 's satisfaction , possibly reduce the length of their ED stay and consequently , have a significant impact on patient quality of care and cost-effectiveness .","The primary objective of the present study would be to determine the additive value on analgesic effectiveness of INF in children aged eight to 18 years with acute moderate to severe headaches . We would also aim to gather information on the safety and acceptability of INF for headaches . We believe that providing INF for moderate to severe headaches will decrease pain levels in children aged 8 to 18 years old . We will perform a prospective , double-blind , randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial . The study setting will be a single center , urban , university-based , tertiary care pediatric university-affiliated hospital ED with an annual census of 75,000 patient visits . The study should be conducted between 2015-2018 . Study population : Inclusion criteria will consist of children aged eight to 18 years who present to the pediatric ED with a chief complaint of headaches , regardless of the type , with a moderate or severe pain score . Pain was considered at least moderate if superior or equal to 36 mm on the VAS as demonstrated by Hirschfeld et . Al . This level have been chosen because it has been recognized that adequate sensitivity in analgesia trials for acute pain can only be obtained if patients experience at least moderate pain before administration of any treatment . Intervention : All patients will receive a 1.5 mcg⁄kg dose of fentanyl or an equivalent volume of similar looking placebo . This will be administered intranasally via a mucosal atomiser device ( MAD ) using 50 mcg/mL solution with a 2 mL syringe . Prior studies have shown that this dose is as effective as IV or IM morphine and provides a bioavailability which is 71 % of the IV dose . The minimum dose prescribed will be 20 mcg , to ensure delivery of 15 mcg of fentanyl to a 10 kg child , allowing for the MAD dead space of 0.1 mL ( 5 mcg of fentanyl ) . For analgesic dose-volumes equal to and less than 0.5 mL , the entire dose will be administered in one nostril ; doses above 0.5 mL will be divided equally and administered to both nostrils . Concentrated medications in a small volume ( 0.2-0.3 mL per nostril ) are ideal , whereas volumes in excess of 1 mL per nostril are not reliably absorbed as a result of mucosal surface saturation and runoff from the nasal cavity . The maximum dose administered will be 100 mcg due to volume constraints . The placebo solution will consist of normal saline that would be delivered via the proposed atomiser . The value administered will be adjusted to the patients weight as for the active study medication . No additional dose of either study medication would be provided . A MAD have been chosen because it is suggested to increase the mucosal coverage and absorption of the medication by atomizing particles and decreasing the amount of medication lost due to swallowing . Oral ibuprofen ( 10 mg/kg ) ( maximum dose of 600 mg ) will also be administered within the first 15 minutes of intranasal administration of the study medication unless it had been given in the previous 4 hours . It has been chosen over acetaminophen because a direct comparison has shown that complete pain relief after two hours is achieved twice as frequently with ibuprofen . The randomization process will occur at the local pharmacy and randomization allotment will be known only by a pharmacist who is not involved in the study . Therefore , all providers involved in the patient 's care and patients will be blinded to group assignment until data analysis completion . The participant will be randomly assigned to one of the two groups as follows : 1 ) INF 1.5 mcg/kg and 2 ) placebo solution , given via an atomizer ( MAD device : MAD Nasal , U.S. Patent # 6,112,743 , Wolfe-Tory Medical , Inc. , 79 West 4500 South , Salt Lake City , Utah 84107 ) . The study medications will be provided to the ED by the local pharmacy . For each randomized patient , a consecutive study medication package will be opened in the ED . Each study package will contain a study medication ( either generic fentanyl bottle or saline bottle ) , a syringe and an atomizer for delivery . An on-site nurse will withdraw the study medication from the specific bottle provided in the package and will deliver the study medication to the patient . The study research assistant will remain blinded . At the pharmacy , the patient 's identification will be coded so that only a user having the access code will be able to identify participants . Procedure : Every patient will be weighed in triage . Enrollment will be limited to times when a research assistant is available . A research assistant will recruit the patients after a pediatric ED physician has assessed them and once the symptoms of headaches are clearly established . The pain associated with headaches will be assessed by using the VAS , which has been validated for the use in children aged eight years and older across a variety of clinical settings and has an excellent interrater-reliability and validity in analgesia research . Once eligibility and exclusion criteria will be confirmed , caregivers will be given written and verbal study information . Written consent for enrolment will be gained from both the accompanying parent and the child , when appropriate . The research assistant will use timers to coordinate all the events . At baseline , before any intervention , the VAS score , baseline vital signs and sedation score ( UMSS ) will be recorded by the research assistant . For the assessment of the VAS score , the children will be asked to mark on a standardized data collection booklet , the level of their pain on a 100-mm non hatched VAS scale with at one end `` no pain '' and at the other `` worst pain ever '' with the following , verbatim : `` Show me on the line the level of your pain : here is no pain ; there is the worst possible pain . '' The patient will then cross a line to indicate his or her level of pain . All measurements will be recorded to the closest 1 mm . At time zero , the solution contained in a syringe will be administered by the on-site nurse to the anterior aspect of the participant 's nasal cavity over few seconds . The dose ( or half of it , if necessary ) will be administered into one of the patient 's nostrils with the MAD . The second half of the dose , if needed , will be administered in the contralateral nostril using the same MAD . Younger children will have the medication administered while sitting in the lap of a parent , with their heads reclined and necks hyperextended . Older children will receive the medication while lying in a semi recumbent position on the gurney . No additional dose would be provided . The research assistant will remain blinded to which medication the patient has received . At the fifteenth , thirtieth and sixtieth minute post-intervention , the research assistant will obtain a pain score via the VAS from the patient and ask for the change in their pain . They will be asked to give a verbal rating of their pain as ' a lot less ' , ' a little less ' , 'the same ' , ' a little more ' or ' a lot more ' compared to the initial baseline , at time zero and reassess level of pain on the VAS as used previously . Children will not be permitted to refer to previous scales markings and will remain blinded to their prior scores . The sedation score will also be recorded using the University of Michigan Sedation Scale ( UMSS ) which overall validity was demonstrated and declared as a simple , valid and reliable tool that facilitates rapid and frequent assessment and documentation of depth of sedation in children . The vital signs will also be taken at these intervals . A detailed demographic and clinical data will also be collected after the study medication administration . A standardized questionnaire of the patient 's present and past headaches , will be completed by the research assistant during their stay in the pediatric ED . The questionnaire will include questions on duration , location , description of pain , associated symptoms of the present headache and past medical history . No other meds , IV fluids , IV procedures or other painful procedures will be done during the study period unless the patient 's condition changes or deteriorates . If any of these procedure is needed during the study period , the patient will be withdrawn from the study and will be treated according of his state of health . At the sixtieth minute of the study , marking the end of the study , patients who had assented to the study and parents will be asked to rate their satisfaction on the efficacy of the study medication on a Likert scale ( 'strongly disagree ' 'disagree ' , 'neither agree nor disagree ' , 'agree ' , or 'strongly agree ' ) . This satisfaction scale will be given to patients and parents after the last pain score was obtained . The study would be then completed , and further care will be at the discretion of the attending pediatric ED medical staff . A follow-up call by a research assistant will be done at 72 hours after discharge to assess headache recurrence , late medication side effects , and a return to another medical facility . All children hospitalized will also be reached . A chart review will be done by a member of the research team to collect final pediatric ED diagnosis as well as any additional investigations ( e.g . CT scan , consultation with a neurologist , blood tests , TSH , etc. ) . Data will be collected using pediatric ED medical records of recruited patients and the sociodemographic questionnaire completed by a research assistant . The results of all other variables : VAS , UMSS and satisfaction score will be collected in real time by the research assistant during the pediatric ED stay . A data collection form will be used , and these forms will be later cross-referenced with the patient 's clinical records by a member of the research team to verify correct documentation and eligibility . Sample size and statistics : This is the first study evaluating pain related to all types of headaches in children . Accordingly , no previous study perfectly matches our design to infer sample size . However , two previous studies evaluated an intervention provided to decrease acute pain secondary to migraine in children using the VAS . These studies reported a standard deviation of 18.5 and 20 mm . Powell et al found the minimum clinically significant difference ( MCSD ) in VAS pain score for children aged 8 to 15 years ( on a 100-mm VAS scale ) to be 10 mm ( 95 % confidence interval 7 to 12 mm ) . In studies of populations , differences of less than this amount , even if statistically significant , are unlikely to be of clinical significance . Previous research in adults has found the same MCSD in VAS pain scores and did not differ in adults with age , sex , or cause of pain . Based on these data , using an alpha value of 0,05 and a power of 80 % , it was estimated that we need , 57 patients per group . Accounting to a maximal 5 % drop-off rate , we inflated this number to 60 participants per group . All data will be entered in an excel database ( Microsoft Inc. , Richmond , WA ) and will be analyzed with SPSS v21 ( IBM Inc ) . The primary study analysis will be a Student 's T-test to compare the mean differences in scores between the intervention group and the placebo group . An intention-to-treat approach will be used . Also , secondary analyses will be performed using a Student 's T-test for continuous variables and a Pearson Chi-square test for categorical variables . The 95 % confidence intervals will be measured for each result .",2015-12-21,"September 2, 2020","Inclusion Criteria : - Inclusion criteria will consist of children aged eight to 18 years who present to the pediatric ED with a chief complaint of headaches , regardless of the type , with a moderate or severe pain score . Pain was considered at least moderate if superior or equal to 36 mm on the VAS as demonstrated by Hirschfeld et . Al . This level have been chosen because it has been recognized that adequate sensitivity in analgesia trials for acute pain can only be obtained if patients experience at least moderate pain before administration of any treatment . Exclusion Criteria : 1 . Allergy or any contra-indication to opioids and-or ibuprofen 2 . Previous participation in study to preserve the statistic independence of each participant 3 . Caregiver unable to provide consent ( language barrier or lack of caregiver presence ) 4 .

University of Minnesota,NCT02636283,Use of Entresto Sacubitril/Valsartan for the Treatment of Peripheral Arterial Disease,University of Minnesota,2,0,Peripheral Arterial Disease,Drug,Entresto,Treatment,Triple,"This study proposes the use of Entresto ( sacubitril/valsartan ) to test the effects on pain free walking duration on patients with peripheral arterial disease , a condition caused by decreased blood flow to the muscles in the legs .","Current approaches for the treatment of peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) lack the success observed in the treatment of other forms of vascular diseases . A potential reason for this may be that available treatments do not target the pathological mechanisms implicated in the development of PAD . These mechanisms include obstruction of aortic-iliac arteries and its branches due to the formation of atherosclerotic plaques and mitochondrial and microvascular dysfunction . Although blood flow improves following surgical revascularization , pain free and maximal walking duration does not improve to the same degree . This suggests that in addition to blood flow obstruction , mitochondrial and microvascular dysfunction are significant factors implicated in the development of PAD . Therefore , any treatment designed for patients with PAD should be aimed at improving mitochondrial and microvascular function . In this regard , natriuretic peptides ( NP ) have been shown to increase mitochondrial and microvascular density and these two findings have been associated with increases in oxygen consumption and perfusion of skeletal muscles . The Investigator proposes that an increase in endogenous natriuretic peptides by inhibiting the enzyme that degrades it in blood will increase mitochondrial and microvascular function and this will be associated with an increase in maximal and pain free walking duration . To test this hypothesis the investigators have designed a double blind randomized controlled clinical trial providing sacubitril/valsartan for 12 weeks trial period.The improvements in mitochondrial and microvascular function will be measured using magnetic resonance ( MR ) spectroscopy and functional MR imaging and an exercise stress test will be used to assess maximal and pain free walking duration . This trial will provide patients with PAD with a non-surgical , cause-specific treatment option .",2015-10-29,"December 5, 2019","Inclusion Criteria : Subject with symptoms of intermittent claudication , such as exercise-induced pain , cramps , fatigue , or other equivalent discomfort , involving large muscle groups of the leg ( s ) ( calf , thigh , buttocks ) , relieved by rest .

Milton S. Hershey Medical Center,NCT02638168,Effects of Evening Dose of Immediate Release Methylphenidate on Sleep in Children With ADHD,Milton S. Hershey Medical Center,4,0,Attention Deficit Disorder With Hyperactivity,Drug,Immediate Release Methylphenidate,Treatment,Triple,"Over 10 % of children in the United States are diagnosed with ADHD , and nearly half of these children have moderate to severe impairments in sleep , further exacerbating their already impaired academic , emotional and social functioning . In children with ADHD , 34 % of prescribed sleep medications are antipsychotics that can cause marked weight gain and metabolic changes ; alternate medications have either been found to be ineffective , difficult to tolerate or are largely unstudied in youth . Delayed sleep onset is strongly correlated with active symptoms of ADHD and Oppositional Defiant Disorder ( ODD ) , suggesting that better control of disruptive behaviors could improve sleep patterns and this application will assess if the extension of the therapeutic effects of CNS stimulants into the early evening improves sleep onset .","The goal of this application is to assess the impact of safer treatment option Methylphenidate ( MPH ) on sleep and behavior problems in children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) and Behavioral Insomnia of Childhood ( BIC ) . ADHD affects over 11 % of school-aged youth . Similarly , pediatric sleep disorders occur in over a third of children and impact multiple domains of the child 's functioning as well as that of their parents . Children with ADHD are at an increased risk for sleep problems with a staggering comorbidity of up to 70 % , while sleep deprivation worsens the already impaired social , emotional and academic functioning of children with ADHD . Therefore , improving sleep may translate into enhanced functioning in multiple realms . Delayed sleep onset latency ( SOL ) and bedtime resistance , the key component of the limit setting type of BIC , are particularly likely to occur in children with ADHD . Medications are commonly used for both conditions with over 6 % of all school-aged children in the United States prescribed medication for ADHD and 7 % for sleep . In children with ADHD , 34 % of prescribed sleep medications are antipsychotics that can cause marked weight gain and metabolic changes . Alternate medications for sleep have either been found to be ineffective , difficult to tolerate or are largely unstudied in youth . MPH has an extensive database supporting their safety and efficacy . Objective sleep studies of MPH have not found consistent results , with a few studies reporting delayed SOL and while others report improved quality of sleep . Therefore , this proposal will evaluate the impact of extending MPH treatment into the early evening on sleep onset using a 3-week with-in subjects randomized trial of .3mg/kg of immediate release ( IR ) MPH dosed 3 hours before bedtime vs. placebo in 38 children with ADHD and chronically delayed SOL who have a history of prolonged stimulant usage .

Recruitment will be split into three waves ( 13 , 13 , 12 participants ) . Parents will be reminded to administer the blinded medication dose by text message each evening ( or phone call by study staff ) 3 hours prior to the desired bedtime . Sleep onset will be measured by actigraphy and sleep log , with parents also reporting on level of ODD and ADHD symptoms in the evening .",2015-12-15,"September 16, 2019","Inclusion Criteria : Ages 6-12 ( inclusive ) , and able to swallow capsule Children who have been treated with a stable morning dose of Extended Release Methylphenidate or twice daily dose of Immediate Release Methylphenidate for an extended period of time ( 30 days or longer ) .
