However , efficacy data from randomised controlled trials comparing aHSCT with approved treatments are still lacking . The best available data concerning disease activity in MS patients with a documented treatment failure are from the CARE-MS II trial . The rate of patients without clinical or radiological disease activity after 2 years was 32 % with alemtuzumab . aHSCT trial data on absence of disease activity show NEDA rates between 70 and 90 % after 2 years . Here we assume 40 % and 80 % after 2 years for the ocrelizumab/alemtuzumab and aHSCT groups , respectively .

Peripheral perfusion of non-vital organs usually impaired earlier than vital organs .

University of Washington,NCT04688346,Cardiovascular Effects of Racemic Epinephrine Pellets,University of Washington,2,1,Epinephrine Causing Adverse Effects in Therapeutic Use,Drug,HemeRX epinephrine pellets,Other,,"The primary aim of this study was to determine if topical racemic epinephrine pellets affect heart rate ( HR ) , systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) , diastolic blood pressure ( DBP ) or mean arterial pressure ( MAP ) in children receiving dental care under general anesthesia ( GA ) . Thirteen patients requiring prefabricated zirconia crowns on both primary maxillary first molars were recruited into a split-mouth randomized controlled pilot study . Patients received a continuous infusion of propofol and remifentanil with inhaled nitrous oxide/oxygen . After patient randomization and tooth preparation , either saline pellets ( control ) or racemic epinephrine pellets ( treatment ) were applied directly to gingival tissue . Vital sign measurements were recorded for 5 minutes . The procedure was repeated with either control or treatment on the contralateral side .","Dental caries is the most common chronic disease of childhood . 3-6 % of US children experience early childhood caries , a condition that may necessitate restorative dental treatment . Prefabricated crowns are the treatment of choice for children with rampant caries involving large or multiple surface lesions or developmental defects . In such situations , crowns reinforce the tooth and provide increased durability and longevity over intracoronal restorations such as fillings . They also reduce the chance that the tooth will experience recurrent decay . In routine clinical practice , preformed metal crowns , also known as stainless steel crowns ( SSC ) are frequently indicated due to their extreme durability , relatively low cost , and minimal technique sensitivity . Stainless steel crowns ( SSC ) are no longer the only standard of care in restoring primary teeth . Although SSCs are highly effective , esthetics can be a concern for parents . Prefabricated zirconia crowns provide an esthetic solution . Zirconia is a crystalline dioxide of zirconium that has mechanical properties similar to those of metals while its color is similar to that of teeth . According to a recent randomized controlled trial , both SSC and zirconia crowns proved to be an excellent choice for molar teeth full coverage restorations . However , zirconia crowns performed better from the standpoint of esthetics , gum tissue response and plaque retention . ( Abdulhadi Bashaer S , Abdullah Medhat M , et al . Clinical evaluation between zirconia crowns and stainless steel crowns in primary molars teeth . Journal of pediatric dentistry . 2017 , Vol 5 , issue 1 ; 21-27 . ) Both Stainless steel crown and zirconia crown preparations include removing caries , followed by reducing the height of the tooth by 1.5 mm , reducing the sides of the tooth to make the pre-fabricated crown fit on the tooth . The SSC preparation requires subgingival reduction 1-2 mm below the gumline on anterior and posterior surfaces ( not medial and lateral ) . The only additional preparation step that zirconia crown preparation involves is medial and lateral reduction of the tooth ; therefore , there is little additional time that is needed for preparation of the crown since the only difference is the depth of the side reduction and preparing it circumferentially . In addition , the Primary Investigator ( PI ) is the provider who will be treating all patients . The PI is an experienced pediatric dentist and has been providing both types of crowns to patients under general anesthesia every week for many years . The average time for a dental procedure under general anesthesia is between 1-3 hours . Factors that increase time include extent of disease , number of fillings/crowns placed , and pediatric dentist 's experience . The pediatric dentist that will be doing the surgery on all patients has been practicing for many years and has prepared thousands of SSC and zirconia crowns . Therefore , it is not anticipated that it will require additional time to prepare the zirconia crowns versus stainless steel crowns . Vital signs ( BP and HR ) will be monitored for 4 minutes/tooth , 5-8 minutes total ( See attached chart showing the difference ) . During this time the patient will be continuously anesthetized and under close observation by the attending anesthesiologist . This constitutes a minimal risk to a child 's health . According to studies , epinephrine half-life is about two minutes and once the epinephrine pellet is removed , concentrations will drop by 93.75 % over 4 half-lives which is about 8 minutes . Therefore , if there is any effect on blood pressure it will show immediately and will go back to normal within the time frame that we are recording data . The procedure will be stopped if the blood pressure is at a harmful range to patient . All children will have both of their maxillary primary first molars ( # B , # I ) prepared for prefabricated Zirconia crowns . Teeth that require pulpotomy or pulpectomy treatment will be excluded from the study . In the control group , hemostasis will be achieved by using two pellets soaked with 0.9 % sodium chloride ( physiological saline ) . In the intervention group , hemostasis will be achieved by using two racemic epinephrine HCl pellets ( HemeRX , Racellet # 3 , Sprig Oral Health Technologies , Inc. Loomis , CA ) . Racellet # 3 contains an average of 0.55 mg ( 0.42 to 0.68 mg/pellet ) of racemic epinephrine hydrochloride per pellet . A standard general anesthesia protocol will be used during the study . All monitoring equipment will be applied at this time for the measurement of vital signs throughout the anesthesia . Vital signs will include : respiratory rate , oxygen-saturated hemoglobin percentage , heart rate ( HR ) in beats per minute ( bpm ) and cardiac rhythm , which will be continuously recorded from a 3-lead electrocardiogram ( ECG ) . The systolic blood pressures ( SBP ) and diastolic blood pressures ( DBP ) will be measured in millimeters of mercury ( mmHg ) via ankle artery cuff connected to monitors . Investigators will use a randomization software before the enrollment of the first subject to randomly determine if the right or the left side of the mouth will be the intervention . Once consent is obtained , randomization software will be used again to determine whether the patient will be given control or intervention treatment first . Once patients are under anesthesia and after other dental treatments are completed , the maxillary first primary molars ( # B , # I ) will be prepared for Zirconia crowns . The crowns will be prepared independently . One tooth will be prepared first , the pre-fabricated crown will be tried on to make sure the fit is correct . Next either intervention or control pellets will be placed around the gumline of the tooth and removed after one minute . The vital signs will continue to be recorded for the next 4 minutes meanwhile he crown is being cemented on the tooth . Once that is done the operator will move to the other tooth and repeat the same steps . The process of preparing the tooth for a Zirconia crown requires a circumferential subgingival preparation . Tissue irritation and bleeding is inherent in this process . Once the crown is ready to be permanently cemented hemostasis becomes very important . In both the control and intervention group of teeth , two pellets will be applied directly around the gingival tissue of the prepared tooth and held for one minute with direct pressure and then removed based on the manufacturer 's recommendation . The time of application will be recorded . The adequacy of hemostasis will be determined subjectively by the attending dentist and recorded as `` adequate '' or `` inadequate '' at 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 minutes after placement . Adequate hemostasis is defined as gingival tissue being dry and hemorrhage-free . Inadequate hemostasis is defined as inability to keep the gingival tissue dry and without hemorrhage . If hemostasis is not achieved after four minutes of managing a subject during the study intervention ( saline or epinephrine pellets ) to which a tooth has been randomized , we will revert to the standard of care in order to stop the bleeding . Lidocaine will not be administered as a primary local anesthetic nor would it be used during our study . Only epinephrine pellets and saline pellets will be used in the study for achieving hemostasis . Cardiovascular outcomes of patient 's systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) , diastolic blood pressure ( DBP ) and heart rate ( HR ) will be collected by the graduate researcher during the procedure . The researcher will record the blood pressure/HR before placement of pellets , immediately after placement and at 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 minutes after placement . The pellets will stay on the tissue for 1 minute only and then removed . The researcher will also record hemostasis efficacy as per dental surgeon as either `` adequate '' or `` inadequate '' during the procedure . In addition to the above measurements , cardiac rhythms will be assessed continuously via ECG and recording any arrhythmias . Mean arterial pressure ( MAP ) , the amount of time in surgery and anesthesia medications used for each patient will also be recorded . All patients will be discharged on the same day after adequate recovery observation time .",2020-11-02,"May 12, 2021","Inclusion Criteria : Children ages 2-9 years undergoing general anesthesia for comprehensive dental treatment at the University of Washington Center of Pediatric Dentistry .

Singapore General Hospital,NCT04400929,Using GM-CSF as a Host Directed Therapeutic Against COVID-19,Singapore General Hospital,2,1,COVID,Drug,Sargramostim,Treatment,Double,"The coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID-19 ) has rapidly become a pandemic . COVID-19 poses a mortality risk of 3-7 % , rising to 20 % in older patients with co-morbidities . Of all infected patients , 15-20 % will develop severe respiratory symptoms necessitating hospital admission . Around 5 % of patients will require invasive mechanical ventilation , and up to 50 % will die . Evidence in severe COVID-19 suggests that these patients experience cytokine storm and progressed rapidly with acute respiratory distress syndrome and eventual multi-organ failure . Early identification and immediate treatment of hyperinflammation is thus recommended to reduce mortality . Granulocyte Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor ( GM-CSF ) has been shown to be a myelopoietic growth factor that has pleiotropic effects in promoting the differentiation of immature precursors into polymorphonuclear neutrophils , monocytes/ macrophages and dendritic cells , and also in controlling the function of fully mature myeloid cells . It plays an important role in priming monocytes for production of proinflammatory cytokines under TLR and NLR stimulation . It has a broad impact on the processes driving DC differentiation and affects DC effector function at the mature state . Importantly , GM-CSF plays a critical role in host defense and stimulating antiviral immunity . Detailed studies have also shown that GM-CSF is necessary for the maturation of alveolar macrophages from foetal monocytes and the maintenance of these cells in adulthood . The known toxicology , pharmacologic and safety data also support the use of Leukine® in hypoxic respiratory failure and ARDS due to COVID-19 . This study aims to recruit patients with evidence of pneumonia and hypoxia who have increased risk for severe disease and need for mechanical ventilation . The overall hypothesis is that GM-CSF has antiviral immunity , can provide the stimulus to restore immune homeostasis in the lung with acute lung injury from COVID-19 , and can promote lung repair mechanisms , which would lead to improvement in lung oxygenation parameters .","The hypothesis of the proposed intervention is that GM-CSF has profound effects on antiviral immunity , can provide the stimulus to restore immune homeostasis in the lung with acute lung injury post COVID-19 , and can promote lung repair mechanisms , which would lead to an improvement in lung oxygenation parameters . This hypothesis is based on experiments performed in mice showing that GM-CSF treatment can prevent mortality and prevent ARDS in mice with post-viral acute lung injury . In the interim analysis of the SARPAC trial , patients who received nebulised Leukine® via a mesh inhaler showed a trend in improvement in their P ( A-a ) O2 gradient at day 6 compared to the SOC group . There are however , anticipated logistical difficulties of training and infection control concerns with administering of nebulised Leukine® via a specialised inhaler in the negative pressure room . Hence we propose to randomize patients with confirmed COVID-19 and acute hypoxic respiratory failure ( saturation < 94 % on room air or PaO2/FiO2 < 350 ) to receive iv Leukine® 125mcg/m2 once a day for 5 days on top of SOC ( treatment group A ) , or to receive SOC treatment only ( placebo group B ) . Dosing of systemic Leukine® is based on prior experience of using this drug in patients with pneumonia-associated ARDS . To measure the effectiveness of Leukine® in restoring lung homeostasis , the primary endpoint of this intervention is measuring oxygenation after 5 days of intravenous treatment through assessment of pre-treatment and post-treatment ratio of PaO2/FiO2 , and through measurement of the P ( A-a ) O2 gradient , which can easily be performed in the setting of clinical observation of inpatients . During the 5-day treatment period , we will perform daily measurements of oxygen saturation ( pulse oximetry ) in relation to FiO2 , and the slope of alterations in these parameters could also be an indicator that our hypothesis is correct . Comparison will be between group A receiving iv Leukine® on top of standard of care ( SOC ) and placebo group B receiving SOC only . Data from the Wuhan COVID-19 epidemic show that patients that deteriorate are facing a prolonged period of mechanical ventilation . Therefore , the study will be unblinded at day 5 , or at any time within the first 5 days of study should the patient deteriorate clinically with need for supplemental oxygen FiO2 requirement ≥ 0.5 . Patients in group B will then have the option to receive 5 days of iv Leukine® , based on the treating physician 's assessment . This group will be group D. Patients who require mechanical ventilation also have the option to receive an additional 5 days of iv Leukine® , based on the treating physician 's assessment ( group C and E ) . A total of 30 patients with confirmed COVID-19 and acute hypoxic respiratory failure will be enrolled , 15 who will receive Leukine® + SOC , and 15 who will receive placebo + SOC . The target group of subjects is defined as confirmed COVID-19 patients with acute hypoxic respiratory failure admitted to the COVID-19 isolation ward . Subjects will be recruited from the isolation wards located in Singapore General Hospital ( SGH ) . Subjects will be identified by the primary managing physicians who are infectious diseases physicians . Safety data , including blood leukocyte counts , will be collected in all patients . Efficacy data will also be collected and will include arterial blood gases , oxygenation parameters , need for ventilation , lung compliance , organ function , radiographic changes , ferritin levels , triglyceride levels , etc . as well as occurrence of secondary bacterial infections .

This Randomized Clinical Trial seeks to evaluate whether Rituximab biosimilar maintains drug-free disease remission in patientswith steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome for 12-24 months and verify its superiority vs. mycophenolate mofetil , the reference standard therapy . The investigators will compare the risk of relapse to test this hypothesis ( primary outcome ) . Secondary objectives will include assessing short- and long-term side-effects and developing specific biomarkers of sensitivity to therapy . Patients will be recruited , treated and followed at IRCCS G Gaslini and IRCCS Bambino Gesù where laboratory studies will be performed at in-site facilities","Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome ( NS ) is characterized by proteinuria and hypoalbuminemia associated with dyslipidemia and hypercoagulability . Oral corticosteroids are the cornerstone of therapy and induce disease remission in approximately 90 % of cases . However , up to 85 % of patients relapse and many develop steroid dependence ( SDNS ) , requiring prolonged dose of steroids to maintain remission . Clinical practice guidelines ( KDIGO ) suggest using low-dose prednisone to maintain remission in SDNS and Mycophenolate Mofetil ( MMF ) or calcineurin inhibitors ( CNI ) as corticosteroid-sparing agents for children who develop steroid adverse effects . Given the toxicity of all these drugs ( steroids , CNI and MMF ) , there is a need to investigate alternative options . Recent evidence supports the use of chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies in simple SDNS ( Rituximab , RTX ) . The RTX4 trial is an open-label , two-parallel-arm , controlled and randomized clinical trial testing the superiority of RTX over MMF in maintaining steroid free disease remission in patients with SDNS . Eligible participants are children and young adults ( age between 3 and 24 years ) with nephrotic syndrome who are dependent on prednisone 0.3-1mg/Kg/day and have received prednisone for at least six months before enrolment . Previous treatment with MMF will be allowed . All participants will enter a 45 days run-in period , during which children treated with steroids alone will start MMF 1,200 mg/1,73 sqm orally in 2 daily doses and will taper steroids after 15 days by 0.3 mg/kg per week until complete withdrawal . Patients already receiving MMF alone will continue the treatment . During the same period , instruction on urine collection and dipstick readings will be carefully reviewed and compliance assessed . After run-in period , children will be randomized to either the intervention arm ( Rituximab , 375mg/m2 ) or the comparator arm ( continuing or starting MMF ) . In the intervention arm , 1 month after infusion MMF will be decreased by 50 % and withdrawn within 2 additional weeks , whereas MMF will be maintained in the comparator . All patients will be followed for up to 24 months . In case of relapses during this period ( see outcome section for definition ) patients will be treated with oral prednisone ( 60 mg/sqm day ) . Following remission , steroids will be maintained at the initial dose for 7 days and then tapered off by 0.3 mg/kg per week until complete withdrawal in patients of the MMF arm . Patients of the intervention arm will instead be treated with another infusion of RTX ( same dose ) immediately following steroid-induced remission . After infusion of RTX , steroids will be maintained at the initial dose for 7 days and then tapered off by 0.3 mg/kg per week until complete withdrawal . In this way relapsed patients in both arms will receive the same cumulative dose of prednisone . In case following relapse of proteinuria patients fail to respond to prednisone ( they will terminate the study and be considered as treatment failure ) . The study allows drop-in from one arm to the other after 3 relapses ( i.e. , investigators will be allowed to use RTX in the comparator arm and vice versa MMF in intervention arm ) . The economic balance will be calculated on the basis of RTX doses needed to maintain remittance . All patients will be followed for 24 months . In person visits will occure at enrollment , at T0 ( infusion ) , after 1 month and every 3/6 months later .

After 2 weeks , the Investigator will examine the treated surface area and determine if the formulation is tolerated such that the subject may apply the next dose strength of VT30 gel for the remaining duration of the Treatment Period . Specifically , the following gel dose strengths ( concentrations ) are planned for Cohorts 1 through 3 in Part 1 : Cohort 1 : initiate dosing with 0.12 % ( w/w ) gel and progress to 0.6 % ( w/w ) gel for the final 2 weeks of the Part 1 Treatment Period ( if the lower dose is tolerated ) Cohort 2 : initiate dosing with 0.6 % ( w/w ) gel and progress to 1.2 % ( w/w ) gel for the final 2 weeks of the Part 1 Treatment Period ( if the lower dose is tolerated ) Cohort 3 : initiate dosing with 1.2 % ( w/w ) gel and progress to 2.3 % ( w/w ) gel for the final 2 weeks of the Part 1 Treatment Period ( if the lower dose is tolerated ) A Safety Review Committee ( SRC ) , with sponsor , investigator and independent medical representation , will provide oversight and guidance for study conduct . After 3 subjects have been dosed for at least 21 days in any of the first three Part 1 cohorts , the SRC may request additional data , approve initiation of the subsequent cohort , or mandate that additional subjects to be enrolled at either the higher or lower dose within the cohort . After 9 subjects in Cohorts 1 through 3 ( 3 subjects per cohort ) have completed the 4-week Treatment Period , the SRC will determine if additional subjects should be assigned to Cohort 4 ( or the final Part 1 cohort ) to receive the MTD ( maximum tolerated dose ) or MFD ( maximum feasible dose ) strength of VT30 . Subjects in Cohort 4 will receive the designated dose strength and regimen of VT30 for a full 4 weeks . Following the completion of Cohort 4 in Part 1 , the SRC will determine whether to authorize initiation of Part 2 and will confirm the dose level and regimen to be administered in Part 2 . Part 2 will be a randomized , placebo-controlled , double-blind study containing 36 subjects assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive either VT30 or placebo . Up to 12 subjects who complete Part 1 may enroll in Part 2 , provided they meet all Part 2-specific inclusion criteria with no applicable exclusions . After the first 12 subjects in Part 2 have completed 4 weeks of treatment , the SRC will conduct a review of blinded safety data to confirm no revisions or changes are needed to the protocol . Subsequent reviews may also be conducted to ensure continued acceptable safety and tolerability . After subjects complete their designated Treatment Period ( in Part 1 or Part 2 ) , they will participate in a 4-week post treatment Follow-up Period .",2020-05-11,"August 1, 2022","Inclusion Criteria : Have signed the current approved informed consent form Have a clinically or phenotypically defined VM , LM , or mixed VLM affecting the skin Lesion genotyping confirms either PIK3CA or TEK mutations , known to be pathogenic Agrees to use contraception if of childbearing potential Be willing and able to comply with the protocol and be available for the entire study Be at least 18 to 60 years of age Lesion must be amenable to defining a contiguous study treatment area of 140 cm2 Exclusion Criteria : Lesion to be treated is on the face or involves mucosa Presence of ulcerations on the target-treatment lesion Known systemic hypersensitivity to the VT30 drug substance , its inactive ingredients , or the vehicle Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus Hyperlipidemia that is poorly controlled on current treatment Pregnant or nursing , planning to become pregnant , or planning to father a child during the study History of malignancy except successfully treated nonmetastatic cutaneous squamous cell or basal cell carcinoma and/or localized carcinoma in situ of the cervix Major surgery within 8 weeks of Screening , or a surgical , laser or other procedure involving the target lesion within 8 weeks of Screening , or planned to occur during the study Any other medical or personal condition that , in the opinion of the Investigator , may potentially compromise the safety or compliance of the subject , or may preclude the subject 's successful completion of the clinical study Medically significant infection ( eg , cellulitis or abscess , or a systemic infection ) within 8 weeks of Screening Ongoing therapy with another topical treatment or any medication that inhibits PI3K , Akt pathway , or the mTOR pathway , or in the opinion of the Investigator , the subject requires systemic therapy for their vascular malformation condition Use of a biologic or systemic immunosuppressive agent within 3 months of Screening Systemic use of corticosteroids , within 30 days of Screening Treatment with a small molecule investigational product within 30 days of Screening , or with any investigational biologic products within 3 months of Screening Positive for hepatitis C antibody , hepatitis B surface antigen , hepatitis B core antibody , or human immunodeficiency virus Alanine transaminase or aspartate transaminase laboratory values in excess of 1.5X the upper limit of normal at Screening Hemoglobin A1c is > 8 % Any other clinically significant laboratory or testing abnormality that , in the opinion of the Investigator , might confound the study , interfere with the subject 's ability to complete the study , or represent a meaningful safety risk upon study enrollment",15,0,18 Years,60 Years

Sodium Cromoglycate ( SCG ) has a very nice safety profile but is less effective when compared to inhaled corticosteroids in asthma patients . However , SCG has been shown to be especially effective in exercise-induced asthma and to reduce metabolite secretion in athletes due to hyperpnoea . Although commercial interest in the drug has fainted , from a clinical point of view , it remains the ideal candidate to be used in adolescents with features of EIB at risk to develop asthma in whom today no treatment would be initiated . This clinical trial ( s63147 ) , which is WP3 of the FWO-TBM project , is a randomized double-blinded trial with subjects who tested positive for the diagnosis of EIB in either WP1 or WP2 .

Universidad Central de Venezuela,NCT04545307,Transplantation of Allogeneic MSC in Patients With Pulp Necrosis and Chronic Apical Periodontitis,Universidad Central de Venezuela,2,1,Pulp Necroses,Biological,Allogenic transplant of BM-MSC in a root canal from patients with immature apexes and pulpar necrosis and apical periodontitis,Treatment,,"The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effect of Mesenchymal Stromal Cell ( MSC ) implantation on pulp and periapical regeneration of immature teeth with pulp necrosis and chronic apical periodontitis . BACKGROUND : Post-traumatic pulp necrosis prevents root development in children and adolescents . The multipotent ability of MSC to differentiate into bone-forming cells ( osteoblasts ) and dentin-forming cells ( Odontoblast ) has allowed the development of protocols to induce dental pulp regeneration in preclinical models and patients with immature teeth with pulpal necrosis . IMPACT : Worldwide , post-traumatic pulp necrosis in children and adolescents constitutes a health problem in the endodontic area . Treatment with MSC would provide an effective therapeutic alternative to patients with pulp necrosis and incomplete root formation . The possible pulp and periapical regeneration of immature teeth induced by MSC would have a huge impact on the treatment of these patients . Eligibility for EMC implant study Age : 6 to 16 years Sex : Male or Female Healthy volunteers accepted : NO . TREATMENT GROUPS : In the present study , the implantation of MSC will be performed in patients with immature teeth with pulpal necrosis with apical periodontitis , who will receive the appropriate endodontic treatment ( according to the guidelines of the American Association of Endodontics ) and implantation of allogeneic BM-MSC . This group will be compared with the history made in the Postgraduate Endodontics of the Universidad Central de Venezuela ( UCV ) and with international case series made by revascularization . Clinical follow-up of each patient : Clinical controls ( facial evaluation , gingival evaluation , apical palpation , horizontal and vertical percussion , cold and heat sensitivity tests ) will be carried out on days 0 , 7 , 30 , 90 , 180 and 364 . Additionally , a clinical evaluation will be carried out at the two years post-implantation of MSC . Radiological controls will be carried out on days 0 , 7 , 30 , 90 , 180 and 364 . Additionally , they will be carried out two years post-implantation of MSC . A tomographic evaluation will be performed when was evident periapical repair in a periapical radiograph . To measure root formation , root canal narrowing and verification the periapical repair in 3D .","The endodontic procedure in the patients included in this study will focus on cases of pulp necrosis with apical periodontitis without evidence of infectious processes . MATERIALS AND METHODS . Reagents Murine monoclonal antibodies , directed against human differentiation antigens ( CD34 , CD45 , CD14 , CD90 , CD73 , CD29 , CD49b , CD166 ) , conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate ( CFI ) or phycoerythrin ( PE ) were purchased from BD Biosciences ( USA ) . Isolation and culture of mesenchymal stromal cells ( MSC ) obtained from human bone marrow . In the present study , isolated EMFs from bone marrow ( BM ) from patients with a diagnosis of post-traumatic nonunion ( failure of a bone union at fracture sites ) will be used . These cells were transplanted into the pseudoarthrosis site to induce bone regeneration in these patients . The protocol for bone regeneration through EMF transplantation was carried out at the University Hospital of Caracas , Hospital Universitario de Los Andes , Hospital Pérez de León II and has the approval of the Bioethics Committees of each institution and each patient through informed consent . In this protocol , the BM of each patient was isolated by a puncture in the iliac crest . This procedure was performed in the operating room , under anesthesia and by a medical specialist . The MO aspirate was placed in alpha-MEM medium ( Invitrogen , USA ) with heparin ( Sanofi Aventis ) . The mononuclear cells were separated by centrifugation on a Ficoll-Hypaque gradient ( GE Healthcare , Sweden ) and cultured in alpha-MEM-Chang medium ( Irvine Scientific , USA ) enriched with 20 % autologous serum . These cells were kept in culture in a controlled environment at 37ºC and 5 % CO2 . After 72 hours , non-adherent cells were eliminated , and a basal culture medium ( alpha-MEM-Chang / 20 % autologous serum ) was added . Their adherence to the plastic isolated the MSCs . Culture medium exchanges were made until reaching a confluence close to 70-80 % . The MSCs were expanded by pealing the cultures , following the process described above . Microbiological examinations were performed after obtaining the BM and before performing the MSC implantation . After using MSC , a batch of these cells were cryopreserved at -70 -C. Phenotypic characterization of MSC . Phenotypic characterization studies of MSC were carried out by flow cytometry . For which the MO adherent cells were detached from the culture flask by using trypsin-like enzymes . Subsequently , the cells were incubated with antibodies specific for MSC markers ( CD90 , CD73 , CD105 , CD29 , CD166 and CD49b ) and hematopoietic ( CD34 , CD45 and CD14 ) . Cytometric analysis of the expression markers showed that 100 % of the cells used for transplantation in each patient were MSC . MSC differentiation studies . The multipotential differentiation capacity of MSCs was examined by culturing these cells in osteogenic , chondrogenic and adipogenic differentiation media , following a methodology similar to that previously described . Briefly , the MSCs were detached and seeded in 24-well culture plates at a cell density of 5x104 per well , proceeding to add the corresponding differentiation medium . For osteogenic differentiation , MSCs were cultured in the presence of basal medium enriched with dexamethasone ( 100nM , Biotech ) , ascorbic acid ( 10mM , Sigma ) , inorganic phosphate ( 1.8mM , Merck ) and beta-glycerol phosphate ( 2mM , Sigma ) . For chondrogenic differentiation , cells were cultured in a commercial medium for chondrocytes ( Cell Application , USA ) and for differentiation towards the adipogenic lineage the commercial medium NH Adipodiff Human ( Miltenyi , USA ) was used . In all cases , the cells were kept in culture for 21-28 days with medium changes every 4-5 days . To demonstrate the changes associated with the differentiation process , the cells were fixed using paraformaldehyde ( Merck , USA ) and specific stains were performed for each case . Briefly , alizarin red to detect calcium deposition ( evidence of osteogenesis ) , Alcian blue to detect proteoglycans ( evidence of chondrogenesis ) , and oil red ( Oil Red ) to see lipids ( evidence of adipogenesis ) . In all cases , microscopic observation and photographic registration were carried out . For endothelial differentiation ( CEn ) , EMFs were cultured in MCDB 131 medium ( Invitrogen , USA ) enriched with 10 % autologous serum , 10µg / ml of human epidermal growth factor ( hu-EGF , R & D ) and hydrocortisone ( 1µg / ml , Sigma ) . MSC implantation in patients with pulp necrosis and apical periodontitis . All MSC processing procedures will be carried out in the cleanroom of the IVIC Cell Therapy Unit following the standards of good manufacturing practice ( GMP ) . Allogeneic BM-MSC from patients diagnosed with post-traumatic nonunion and treated with implantation of these cells will be used to induce bone regeneration . The MSC to be used in this protocol have previously been phenotypically and functionally characterized . The MSC will be thawed , grown and expanded as previously described . A part of the cells will be kept in a medium for MSCs , and another part will be cultured in endothelial differentiation medium ( CEM-Endo ) . Once the required number of MSCs and MSCs-Endo have been reached , a suspension of these cells ( 75,000 cells from each of them ) will be placed in sterile culture tubes containing DMEM-F12 culture medium , without phenol red , supplemented with 20 % autologous serum . Each tube containing MSC / MSC-Endo will be transported in a small biological sample transport cellar , at room temperature , to the Dentistry Service of the Instituto Venezolano de Investigaciones Científicas ( IVIC ) . Under sterile conditions , the patient will be locally anesthetized in the affected tooth area ; the root canal of the affected tooth will be exposed and prepared to perform the MSC / MSC-Endo / PRP implant . At the same time , the culture medium supernatant is removed from each tube and the CEM / CEM-Endo `` button ( pellet ) '' is resuspended in autologous platelet-rich plasma ( PRP ) . Subsequently to the MSC / Endo / PRP suspension , 5 % CaCl2 and thrombin will be added . Immediately , and before the clot forms , 20 microliters of the CEM / CEM-Endo / PRP suspension will be placed in the root canal , covered with a collagen membrane . Subsequently , the obturation procedure with bioceramics will be carried out at the level of the pulp chamber , ionomeric glass to protect the bioceramic and later composite resin to restore the tooth . Post-implantation clinical evaluation of EMF Clinical controls ( facial evaluation , gingival evaluation , apical palpation , horizontal and vertical percussion , cold and heat sensitivity tests ) will be carried out on days 0 , 7 , 30 , 90 , 180 and 364 .

Severe pneumonia associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) is the most threatening and feared complication of COVID-19 infection , with mortality rates close to 50 % in some groups . Autopsies between these severe cases reveal severe capillary involvement , with signs of intense inflammatory changes , microvascular thrombosis , endothelial injury and abnormal tissue repair . The available evidence suggests that abnormal activation or imbalance in the counter-regulation of the kallikrein-kinin system may play a central role in a positive feedback cycle , leading to consequent diffuse microangiopathy . Blockade of the kallikrein-kinin system can therefore prevent deterioration of lung function by reducing inflammation , edema and microthrombosis .

Universiteit Antwerpen,NCT04544787,A Phase 2 Study to Evaluate the Safety and Immunogenicity of Two Oral Poliovirus Vaccine Candidates,Pierre Van Damme,2,1,Poliomyelitis,Biological,Novel OPV2 candidate 1,Prevention,Quadruple,This study is designed to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of two novel type 2 oral poliovirus vaccine ( nOPV2 ) candidates ( nOPV2 candidate 1 and nOPV2 candidate 2 ) in adults . The primary objectives of the study include the general safety and immunogenicity of the two candidate vaccines in healthy volunteers previously vaccinated with Sabin monovalent OPV or inactivated polio vaccine ( IPV ) only .,"Two nOPV2 vaccine candidates have been developed as attenuated serotype 2 polioviruses derived from a modified Sabin 2 infectious complementary deoxyribonucleic acid ( cDNA ) clone . nOPV2 Candidate 1 ( S2/cre5/S15domV/rec1/hifi3 ) and nOPV2 Candidate 2 ( S2/S15domV/CpG40 ) were generated by modifying the Sabin-2 ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) sequence to improve phenotypic stability and make the strains less prone to reversion to virulence . The novel vaccine will eventually be licensed based on 3 criteria : a similar safety profile to the currently licensed monovalent OPV2 ( mOPV2 ) of the Sabin strain , non-inferior immunogenicity , and reduced reversion to virulence . Due to the withdrawal of Sabin monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 and prohibition of its use from April 2016 onward , well before the availability of nOPV2 for clinical testing , a head to head comparison of nOPV2 and mOPV2 is not possible . For these reasons , Phase 4 trials have been conducted with Sabin mOPV2 to provide control data on safety , immunogenicity , against which data for nOPV2 in subsequent Phase I and II studies will be evaluated and compared . The Phase 4 trials of Sabin mOPV2 were designed to parallel the expected design of the Phase 1 and 2 nOPV2 studies with respect to overall design , inclusion of similar study cohorts . This study is designed to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of two novel type 2 OPV candidates in adults before testing in young children and then infants . The study will include both OPV-vaccinated and IPV-vaccinated adults to provide safety and immunogenicity data relevant to the decision to advance to future studies with testing in children who have not been exposed to OPV2 . The primary objectives of the study include the general safety and immunogenicity of the two candidate vaccines , primarily based on comparison with historical data obtained in a Phase 4 study of Sabin mOPV2 for OPV-vaccinated subjects , in order to establish non-inferior immunogenicity and acceptable safety profile . Assessment of the general safety of the 2 candidate vaccines in IPV-only vaccinated participants will be based on comparison with data from a placebo group . The phase 4 control study ( UAM1 ) used for the comparison in this study is registered with EudraCT ( 2015-003325-33 ) . Participants were healthy adults aged 18-50 years with documented history of at least three polio vaccinations , including OPV , and were randomly assigned to either one dose or two doses of monovalent OPV2 .

Recently , the short-chain fatty acid , butyrate , has been reported to have some effect on blood pressure . Butyrate is not normally ingested since it is made by bacteria in the gut as a byproduct of fiber fermentation . In this proof of concept study , the investigators will investigate the effect of butyrate absorbed in the gut ( via the participant self-administering an enema with butyrate ) has on blood pressure .","Description : African Americans ( AA ) have the greatest burden of hypertension . Recently , gut microbial dysbiosis ( a term that describes a poorly diverse gut microbial profile and lower short-chain fatty acid ( SCFA ) production ) has been linked to hypertension and may be involved in the pathogenesis of hypertension in African Americans . African Americans have been reported to have lower gut SCFA and SCFA can reduce blood pressure . This is a proof of concept pilot study to determine the relationship between gut SCFA and blood pressure ( BP ) . Delivery of butyrate to the gut will be via enema .

Though OPV is safe and effective , it can mutate and reacquire neurovirulence in rare circumstances . This can result in vaccine-associated paralytic polio ( VAPP ) and circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses ( cVDPVs ) on rare occasions . Use of tOPV , therefore , had the risk of generating VAPP and seeding new type 2 circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses ( cVDPV2 ) , even though the wild type 2 virus was eradicated in September 2015 . For this reason tOPV vaccine was withdrawn globally in April 2016 and switched to the bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine ( bOPV ) . Circulating vaccine-derived type-2 poliovirus ( cVDPV2 ) outbreaks have occurred in sixteen countries after cassation of OPV2 . Using stockpiled mOPV2 to respond to this situation risks propagating new cVDPVs and this phenomenon has already been observed in multiple geographies following the switch . Inactivated polio vaccine ( IPV ) induces only limited intestinal mucosal immunity and is not effective to interrupt fecal-oral route transmission in settings of poor hygiene and sanitation . Therefore , development of novel oral polio vaccine/s with enhanced genetic stability and lower risk of reversion to neurovirulence compared to current Sabin 2 strains is a major priority of the global polio eradication Program . Knowledge gap : The current clinical development plan outlines studies through Phase II development with the nOPV2 candidate strains being tested in adult , toddler , and infant populations who have received prior dose/s of OPV and/or IPV . No study has been conducted in truly naive newborns with no prior receipt of any polio vaccines to strengthen the clinical evidence in favour of utilizing these novel OPV strains . Relevance : Existing Sabin type 2 polio virus vaccines can mutate in to pathogenic virus and become neurovirulent , causing VAPP and cVDVP . So novel type 2 polio virus candidate vaccines is an urgent need especially for outbreak situations . The nOPV2 strains are intended for use as safer alternatives to mOPV2 vaccines for outbreak response . Data from this proposed study result will further strengthen the clinical evidence base to deploy novel , genetically stable OPV strains to reduce the risk of generating cVDPV and VAPP . The study will generate data on novel OPV2 candidates for pre-licensure use in outbreak scenarios and for eventual full licensure and WHO Prequalification . Hypothesis : Vaccinating healthy newborns with novel type 2 polio virus candidate vaccines ( nOPV2 ) is safe and can induce a putatively protective immune response . Objectives : Primary Objectives : Safety : • To evaluate the safety and tolerability after one and two doses of nOPV2 vaccine candidates 1 , given 4 weeks apart in poliovirus vaccine-naïve newborns . Immunogenicity : • To evaluate the immune response ( measured by seroconversion rate ) to vaccination after one and two doses of nOPV2 vaccine candidate 1 , given 4 weeks apart in poliovirus vaccine-naïve newborns . Secondary objectives : Immunogenicity : To evaluate seroprotection rate , geometric mean and median titers to vaccination after one dose of nOPV2 vaccine candidate 1 in poliovirus vaccine-naïve newborns . To further evaluate seroprotection rate , geometric mean and median titers to vaccination after two doses of nOPV2 candidate 1 in poliovirus vaccine-naïve newborns . Viral Shedding : To assess the rate of fecal viral shedding ( as determined by real-time RT-PCR ) at fixed time points following one and two doses of nOPV2 vaccine candidate 1 in newborns .

To assess the extent of fecal viral shedding ( the quantity of nOPV2 virus shedding , measured asCCID50 per g of stool ) at fixed time points following one and two doses of nOPV2 vaccine candidate 1 in newborns . Exploratory objective : • To assess genetic stability through genetic deep sequencing assay and neurovirulence test through transgenic mice NV assays from a subset of participants stools samples . Methods : The study is a Phase II clinical trial which will be conducted in rural Bangladesh at Matlab . The total enrolment target for the clinical trial is 330 , with 220 in nOPV2 candidate 1 arm and 110 in placebo arm .

All eligible healthy newborn participants will be vaccinated orally at birth and at 4 weeks of age with C1 ( 105.0± 0.5 CCID50 , 2 drops ) or placebo ( 2 drops ) of age followed by fIPV + bOPV at week 8 , bOPV at week 12 and fIPV + bOPV at week 16 and other vaccines according to EPI schedule in Bangladesh . In order to record any immediate reaction participants will be observed for 30 minutes following each dose of vaccination . Study staff will visit homes of the participants daily for 7 days to collect systemic solicited adverse events after study vaccination using electronic dairy cards . Unsolicited adverse events , adverse events of special interest and serious adverse events will be collected throughout the entire study period by weekly home visit . Mothers of the participant will be provided a telephone number to communicate with the investigator for any adverse or serious adverse events . Three blood samples each of 1 ml , will be collected to measure the immune response of nOPV vaccine candidate 1 : the first pre-vaccine blood sample on the day of first dose nOPV2 vaccine candidate 1 /placebo ( at birth ) , second blood sample at 4 weeks before second dose nOPV2 vaccine candidate 1 /placebo and the third blood sample will be collected at 8 weeks before giving fIPV + bOPV vaccine . Mothers of enrolled participants will be requested to collect about 8 grams ( about the size of one adult thumb ) of stool from participants to assess viral sheddings . A total of seven stool samples will be collected : the first pre-vaccine sample will be collected on the day of first dose nOPV2 vaccine candidate 1 /placebo ( at birth ) , second sample at week 2 , third sample at week 4 before second dose nOPV2 vaccine candidate 1 /placebo , fourth stool sample at week 6 , fifth stool at week 8 before giving fIPV + bOPV vaccine , sixth stool sample at week 10 and seventh sample at week 12 of age to assess viral shedding .

Universidad Autonoma de San Luis Potosí,NCT04698525,Comparative Study Between Valproate and Memantine in the Prophylactic Management of Episodic Migraine.,Universidad Autonoma de San Luis Potosí,3,1,Migraine Headache,Drug,Valproate Sodium,Treatment,Single,"Migraine is one of the three most disabling diseases worldwide . Constituted by recurrent episodes of headache , characterized by unilateral location , throbbing character , moderate or severe intensity , worsening with physical activity , and association with nausea or photophobia and/or phonophobia . There are two types of drug treatment : abortifacient and prophylactic . The American Academy of Neurology classifies sodium valproate as level A ; however , some patients do not obtain a satisfactory response rate and/or have adverse effects . Therefore , the search for new pharmacological treatments continues . In 2015 , a double-blind , randomized clinical trial with a placebo was carried out to assess Memantine 's efficacy in the prophylactic treatment of migraine without aura , which reported a reduction of 2.3 migraine attacks per month compared to the placebo group . Memantine could be a new effective treatment alternative , which is why we will compare the efficacy of Memantine against sodium valproate as a prophylactic migraine treatment . Main objective : To compare the efficacy of Memantine at a rate of 20mg divided into two doses a day against sodium valproate ( VPA ) at a rate of 1000mg divided into two doses a day prophylactic treatment of migraine for three months . Study design : a prospective controlled , randomized , double-blind clinical trial . Inclusion criteria : Men and women aged 18 to 65 years with a diagnosis at least one year before the study must present at least 2 to 8 migraine attacks per month and less than 15 days with headache per month , which should not be receiving prophylactic treatment for migraine and sign an informed consent Sample size calculation and statistical analysis : It is calculated using the normal distribution model , where the recommended sample size is 196 participants . Since a pilot study will be conducted , 10 % of the sample size will be taken to make it representative , a sample size of 20 participants is decided for each group .","Migraine is a primary headache , currently one of the three most disabling diseases globally . It has an annual and lifetime prevalence of 18 % and 33 % in women , and 6 to 13 % in men , respectively , with a predominance in women ( 3 : 1 ) . The age of onset with the highest prevalence is between 25 and 55 years . Migraine is described by the International Headache Society ( IHS ) as recurrent episodes of headache lasting 4 to 72 hours , characterized by unilateral location , pulsatile character , moderate or severe intensity , worsening with physical activity , and association with nausea or photophobia and phonophobia . The IHS also classifies migraine based on the frequency of attacks : episodic migraine when the headache occurs on less than 15 days a month , and chronic migraine , when the headache occurs 15 or more days a month for three months and at least eight days a month with characteristics of migraine headache . The subtypes of migraine concerning their clinical presentation are migraine with aura and without aura.4 Up to one-third of patients present migraine aura , with visual symptoms being the most frequent . Four phases have been identified during a migraine : prodromal phase , aura , headache , and postdrome . The prodromal phase is characterized by premonitory symptoms hours before the headache , including difficulty concentrating , irritability , fatigue , repetitive yawning , stiff neck , and photophobia . Recurrent episodes characterize the aura , lasting from 5min to 60min , with transient unilateral visual , sensory , or other CNS symptoms that develop progressively , usually precede headache and symptoms associated with migraine.4 The aura 's genesis is activated by the NMDA ( N-methyl-D-aspartate ) receptor and disseminated cortical depression . Disseminated cortical depression is an extreme depolarization of the cell membranes of the glia and neurons that produce an alteration of the ionic gradient , an increase in extracellular potassium concentrations , glutamate release , and a transient increase followed by a decrease in cerebral blood flow . The pain phase in migraine is due to the activation and sensitization of the trigeminovascular pain pathway , which innervates intracranial structures , including the eye , the dura mater , large braincases , and the venous sinuses . It has been shown to involve neuronal presynaptic activation by ID serotonin receptors ( 5-HT 1D ) , resulting in the release of the calcitonin gene ( CGRP ) and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide ( PACAP-38 ) , which are neuroinflammatory peptides . The post-synaptic effect on the meninges includes the activation of the arachidonic acid cascade , which conditions inflammation and vasodilation , stimulates the nociceptive afference of pain first branch of the trigeminal nerve . The diagnosis of migraine is clinical and must meet the criteria of the IHS International Classification of Headaches ( ICH-3 ) , which are for migraine without aura : At least five crises that meet criteria B-D. A. Headache episodes are lasting 4 to 72 hours ( untreated or unsuccessfully treated ) . B . The headache has at least two of the following four characteristics : Unilateral location . Pulsatile character . Pain of moderate or severe intensity . Made worse by or conditions the abandonment of habitual physical activity ( e.g. , walking or climbing stairs ) . C. At least one of the following during the headache : Nausea and vomiting . Photophobia and phonophobia . D. No better explanation by another diagnosis of ICHD-III . The non-pharmacological treatment of migraine goes hand in hand with the pharmacological one ; one is to avoid the triggers of the migraine attacks and carry out the lifestyle modifications . Pharmacological treatment is divided into acute ( administered at the time of headache ) and prophylactic ( administered daily to reduce the chances of migraine episodes ) . The objective of prophylactic treatment is to reduce the frequency , duration , and severity of migraine attacks , improve the response to acute treatment , improve functionality , and reduce disability . The American Academy of Neurology recommends initiating prophylactic treatment in patients with migraine with one or more of the following characteristics9 Recurrent migraine , which interferes with the patient 's daily life and quality of life . Frequent headaches . That they have an inadequate response or contraindication to abortive treatment . Adverse events to abortion treatment . Uncommon migraine conditions : ophthalmoplegic migraine , basilar migraine , hemiplegic , prolonged aura , migraine infarction . The IHS defines the response to treatment as a decrease equal to or greater than 50 % in the frequency of migraine attacks compared to the baseline situation . The American Academy of Neurology guideline for the prophylactic drug treatment of episodic migraine classifies divalproex sodium , valproate sodium ( VPA ) , topiramate , metoprolol propranolol as level A ( Drugs with established efficacy ) . Valproic acid ( 2-propylpentaenoic acid ) was first synthesized in 1882 as an analog of valeric acid , naturally found in valerian . Anyone of Valproic acid , sodium valproate , or a mixture of the two ( sodium valproate ) has a mechanism of action characterized by increasing or improving GABA neurotransmission , blocking voltage-gated sodium channels , and T-type calcium channels . In 2013 , Cochrane conducted the review : Valproate for the prophylaxis of episodic migraine ( Linda et al . ) , where they evaluated ten clinical trials . Two crossover clinical trials for sodium valproate demonstrated a significant reduction in headache frequency than placebo ( MD -4.31 95 % CI -8.32 to -0.30 ) , which shows us in clinical terms an approximate reduction of four headaches for every 28 days . Jensen 199413 showed that sodium valproate is superior to placebo ( OR 4.67 ; 95 % CI 1.54 - 14.14 ) , suggesting that patients are three times more likely to present a reduction equal to or greater than 50 % in the frequency of headaches compared to placebo . The recommended dose for migraine headaches is 500-1000mg per day . The most common adverse effects are asthenia , fatigue , dizziness/vertigo , nausea , tremor , and weight gain . In recent years , interest has increased in glutamate receptor antagonists for migraine prophylaxis , such as memantine . Within the pathophysiology of migraine , glutamate is implicated in disseminated cortical depression , trigeminal-vascular activation . Other studies corroborate its role by reporting elevated glutamate levels in the cerebrospinal fluid in patients with chronic migraine in the ictal period and elevated serum levels in migraine patients . Besides , after experimental stimulation in the dura and the ventral-posteromedial thalamic nucleus structures , elevated levels of glutamate in the trigeminal-cervical complex have been evidenced . fifteen In 2008 Bigal and colleagues conducted the first open clinical trial , a pilot study to evaluate memantine 's efficacy and safety as a prophylactic treatment in patients diagnosed with refractory migraine . A sample of 28 participants who had a baseline frequency of headache days of 21.8 days per month received memantine from 10mg to 20mg per day for three months . A decrease in the frequency of headache days was obtained to 16.1 ( P < 0.01 ) . Therefore , the authors concluded that memantine as a prophylactic treatment is safe and effective in refractory migraines . In 2015 , Noruzzadeh and colleagues conducted the first randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate memantine 's efficacy as a prophylactic treatment of migraine without aura With a sample of 52 participants , 25 with memantine ( 10 mg/day ) and 27 with placebo . The memantine group had a more significant reduction in the frequency of migraine attacks compared to placebo , which was a difference of 2.3 attacks per month with a P < 0.001.14",2020-12-08,"May 13, 2023","Inclusion Criteria : Men and women from 18 to 65 years old .

Our aim and objectives are to : To check the possible effects of Moxifloxacin and Gemifloxacin in healthy volunteers for possible effects on blood glucose levels with a subsequent shift in serum insulin level of healthy volunteer ( target population ) . ECG morphology effect . In the above entitled studies we are going to determine the effects of the above two 4th generation fluoroquinolones drugs on the blood glucose levels and ECG morphology effect.of euglycemics healthy volunteers.The drug will be gave as per approved standard adult dose.The drug is FDA approved and marketed drug.No risk is to the patient only 3-5 ml of the blood will be taken at baseline and after the drug completion at steady state concentration .,"The study will be conducted under good clinical practice guidelines and a consent form will be signed from the healthy volunteers as per design of World health organization.The study has no harmful effects on the heaths of the volunteers as we are conducting the study for five dose/one pack drug will be gaven . The volunteers will be sampled randomly and the effect of the said drugs will be determined on blood glucose and insulin level . Diabetes mellitus ( DM ) , a non-communicable disease , which is considered now-a-days a life threatening disease to the human health ( 1,2 ) .According to the report of International Diabetes Federation ( IFD ) and World Health Organization ( WHO ) , diabetes mellitus is one of the World 's fifth leading cause of mortality and about 415 million people of the world 's population have diabetes mellitus in 2018 ( 3 ) . After every 6 seconds , a person dies from diabetes mellitus ( 4 , 5 ) . Pakistan is a country with 7th highest diabetic population in the world and it is assumed to rise to 4th highest place by 2030 ( 6 ) . Due to sedentary life style of People , there is a maximum increase of DM in the last decade ( 7 ) . DM is classified into two classes i.e . Type I and Type II ( 8 ) . The Type I diabetes is much more common . It is due to defective insulin secretion or insulin action or both ( 9 ) . The Type II diabetes is now-a-days attributed to genetic disorders affecting the beta cells of the pancreas ( 10 ) , or the ability of body cells to respond to insulin action leading to insulin resistance DM ( 11 , 12 ) . Fluoroquinolones ( FQs ) are a group of antibacterial antibiotics . Newer fluoroquinolones has expanded its traditional coverage from Gram-negative coverage to Gram-positive as well as to anaerobic organisms ( 14-16 ) . It has been used since 2-3 decades and has been observed to have excellent anti-microbial coverage , but unfortunately the FQs are associated with adverse drug events including strong dysglycemic effects which has also led to irreversible brain damage and even death ( 17 ) . Till date , six different types of adverse drug reactions have been reported with Fluoroquinolones . These include prolongation of QT interval , Photo toxicity , hepatotoxicity and alteration in the blood glucose hemostasis ( hyperglycemia or sometimes hypoglycemia ) , damage to the tendons leading to tendinitis ( 18 ) . Canadian Adverse Drug Reaction Monitoring Program ( CADRMP ) reported that three marketed fluoroquinolones namely gatifloxacin , levofloxacin and moxifloxacilin are under Metabolic and Nutritional Disorders category . Among them Temafloxacin , levofloxacin and gatifloxacin have been reported to be associated with hemolysis ( 19 ) . It has been assumed that the dysglycemic effects of FQs mainly occur through their action on the ATP- sensitive K + channels . According to definition , an agent that causes the selective relaxation of an induced contractility due to low K+ ( 20-25 mM ) is grouped as K+ channel opener . From the studies it can be assumed that fluoroquinolones may block the ATP-sensitive K+ channels as well as the opening of as Calcium channels that are voltage dependent ( 22 ) . These opened Calcium channels further depolarize the membrane potential ultimately releasing insulin . These Studies reveals that fluoroquinolones have pancreatic beta cell cytotropic activity , however the dysglycemic effects of Moxifloxacin and Gemifloxacin have not been proven but very strong associations have been demonstrated via some case report studies ( 21 ) . Keeping in view all these studies and developments regarding the adverse effects associated with fluoroquinolones specially the dysglycemic effects due to cytotropic influence on the beta cells of the pancreas it is now very much needed to actually correlate these effects seen in the beta cells of the pancreas with the pancreatic tissue histopathological changes . Since , Moxifloxacin and Gemifloxacin are a new generation quinolones , thus our study focuses on them to get a clear picture of its possible shift of blood glucose and insulin in our society . Thus the hallmark of our study is to focus on dysglycemic effects ( either hyperglycemic or hypoglycemic effects ) associated with quinolones , it is not clear to get a clear picture on blood glucose level until it is tested in control environment of a preclinical study , and to translate the possible effects of the preclinical study in a controlled clinical trial of healthy volunteers who are euglycemics as well .",2020-12-29,"April 10, 2023",Inclusion Criteria : Healthy volunteers having age from 20- 40 years Non-Diabetic Non-Alcoholics Non-Smokers Non-Hypertensive Exclusion Criteria : Patients with QT interval prolongation in ECG Patients unwilling to give consent Patients already on antibiotic therapy for a period one to two week or above .

National University of Malaysia,NCT04573218,Supplementation of Oil Palm Phenolics to Improve Lipid Profile in Subjects With Minor Hyperlipidaemia,Isa Naina Mohamed,2,1,Hyperlipidemias,Drug,Placebo,Treatment,Triple,"An unpublished study by the investigators on healthy participants has shown that the supplementation of oil palm phenolics ( OPP ) at 250 mg is the optimum dose to demonstrate the ability to lower total and LDL cholesterol . There is no clinical evidence as yet on that optimum dosage of OPP supplementation in improving fasting lipid profile in minor hyperlipidemia subjects . The investigators hypothesize that in a clinical study , OPP supplemented to the minor hyperlipidemic participants will elicit a reduction in total and LDL cholesterol while maintaining safety and tolerability . OPP may have the potential to be positioned as natural health supplement in improving lipid profile .","Oil palm phenolics ( OPP ) is a product filtrated from vegetation liquor of an aqueous waste stream following palm oil milling process . A novel process to recover OPP that contains a high amount of phenolic from the waste has been explored tremendously . Due to the high phenolic content , OPP has been postulated in possessing various medicinal properties such as antioxidant , anti-inflammatory , neuroprotective and anti-tumour effects . Hyperlipidemia is a well-known risk factor for cardiovascular diseases ( CVD ) . It can be defined as elevations of fasting total cholesterol or triglyceride concentration or both . According to a previous research , OPP supplementation to hamster animal model has shown positive effects in the reduction of total cholesterol and triglycerides as well as improvement of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL-C ) . In a previous study using the rabbit animal model , OPP has shown a protective effect against atherosclerosis , a condition whereby fat and cholesterol plaques are deposited inside the arteries . Based on the current evidence from the preliminary studies on OPP , the investigators hypothesize that supplementation of OPP may prevent or delay the development of CVD . In the investigator 's previous clinical trial phase I , an optimum dosage of OPP has been obtained . Therefore , the investigators proposed a phase II clinical trial to evaluate the ability of OPP to reduce the total and LDL cholesterol in minor hyperlipidemic participants . This study will be initiated with the recruitment of 50 volunteers with minor hyperlipidemic condition . In this study , the participants will be supplemented with placebo/OPP capsules for 60 days . Participants will be required to take the placebo/OPP capsules in front of the study staff to ensure compliance .

Leiden University Medical Center,NCT04577066,Safety and Preliminary Protective Efficacy of Genetically Attenuated GA2 Parasites.,Leiden University Medical Center,1,1,Plasmodium Falciparum Malaria,Other,GA2,Prevention,Double,This study will consist of two phases and be aimed at assessing the safety and tolerability of the new genetically attenuated GA2 malaria parasite ( Phase 1 ) and its preliminary protective efficacy against controlled human malaria infection ( Phase 2 ) in healthy Dutch volunteers .,"Malaria is one of the most common tropical diseases , accounting for 228 million infections and 450.000 deaths each year . It is caused by five species of protozoan parasites belonging to the genus of the Plasmodia . Plasmodia have a complex life cycle : they are injected into the human host by female Anopheles mosquitos , migrate to the liver to replicate and then enter red blood cells . The typical symptoms of malaria with fever episodes are caused by the bursting of red blood cells , as the parasites leave to infect new cells . The rising resistance of both parasites against anti-malarial drugs and mosquitoes against insecticides , make the need to eradicate malaria even more impellent . A promising approach to disease control is the development of an effective vaccine . Among the different approaches to vaccine development , live attenuated parasites stand out for their high protective efficacy ( > 90 % ) . The GA2 parasite , a new genetically attenuated malaria parasite , which is derived from the NF45 Plasmodium falciparum strain and has been engineered to arrest development in the liver before entering the bloodstream , was recently created . It should therefore not be able to cause malaria in humans . The idea is that the GA2 parasite will prime the immune system for recognition of non attenuated parasites in the future without causing disease itself . In other words , exposure to the innocuous GA2 parasite could confer protection against pathogenic malaria parasites . Hence , this study is aimed at investigating the safety and tolerability of the GA2 parasite and at determining its potential protective efficacy against controlled human malaria infection . The former question will be investigated by exposing volunteers to sequentially increasing numbers of GA2-infected mosquito bites . The latter question will be investigated by repeatedly ( 3 times ) exposing volunteers to the GA2 parasite and once to unattenuated parasites . The efficacy of the GA2 parasite will be compared to another genetically attenuated parasite , the GA1 , which in previous studies has been shown to be safe and well-tolerated but only have limited protective efficacy . There will also be a placebo group .",2020-09-22,"January 12, 2023","Inclusion Criteria : Subject is aged ≥ 18 and ≤ 35 years and in good health .

To evaluate safety and efficacy of a bolus loading dose and continuous intravenous infusion of L-Citrulline compared to placebo in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infection ( SARS-CoV-2 ) .","Intravenous L-citrulline ( Turnobi ) administration will safely restore the homeostasis of nitric oxide synthase by increasing both plasma citrulline and arginine levels . Investigators also reason that restoration of citrulline/arginine balance through citrulline administration will safely re-establish homeostasis of NOS , lower oxidative stress , and reduce inflammation , thereby delaying and potentially preventing the need for invasive mechanical ventilation in participants hospitalized with COVID-19 infection ( SARS-CoV-2 ) . The body lives in a delicate balance of homeostasis . The urea/NO cycle plays a critical role in maintaining redox homeostasis and as such , also plays a role in regulating inflammation . The biochemical relationships are complex and depend on inter-organ transfer , membrane transport , and intracellular compartmentation . However , data above demonstrate that citrulline , arginine , and NO are critical in maintaining this homeostasis through their regulation of NOS . Inflammation , especially from infection , results in decreased activity of CPS1 and increased activity of arginase , which decreases levels of both citrulline and arginine . These decreased levels result in dysregulated and uncoupled NOS , which drives both overexuberant NO production and formation of ROS . Both the NO production and ROS further exacerbate the inflammatory cascade , resulting in other organ dysfunctions , including acute lung injury . Both inflammation and oxidative stress have been shown to be driving forces for the development of ALI and regulated NOS function is vital to reducing both . Both plasma citrulline and arginine are deficient in sepsis and levels are inversely associated with development of ALI . Furthermore , citrulline replacement safely increases plasma levels of both citrulline and arginine in healthy volunteers , BMT patients , adults with sepsis , children with sickle cell disease , and children after congenital heart surgery . It seems highly likely that citrulline therapy in the setting of COVID-19 ( SARS-CoV2 ) induced acute hypoxemic respiratory illness will safely increase citrulline and arginine levels and help re-establish NOS homeostasis , resulting in NO production in compartments that are more homeostatically appropriate so as to reduce pulmonary vascular resistance and enhance coupling of NOS to minimize superoxide production thus reducing free radical mediated ALI .",2020-09-17,"January 26, 2023","Inclusion Criteria : Age 18-65 years .

Osimertinib , a third-generation EGFR TKI , has become the standard therapy for NSCLC patients with acquired EGFR T790M mutation . However , acquired resistance to osimertinib is still inevitable and there is no established targetable agent currently . Thus , treatment strategy for patients with acquire resistance to osimertinib remains an urgent issue . In this study , we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of osimertinib combined with anlotinib in acquired EGFR T790M mutated NSCLC patients with gradual progression on osimertinib treatment .","In current clinical practice , acquired resistance to osimertinib can be divided into three clinical modes : dramatic progression , gradual progression and local progression . For patients with gradual progression , there are various clinical explorations，including the continuation of osimertinib with chemotherapy or radiotherapy , osimertinib combined with antiangiogenic agents . In preclinical studies , an overactive vascular endothelial growth factor/vascular endothelial growth factor receptor ( VEGF/VEGFR ) pathway and tumour angiogenesis plays a crucial role in the resistance to EGFR-TKIs , and the dual targeting of both the VEGF and EGFR pathways may prevent resistance . Anlotinib ( AL3818 ) is an inhibitor targeting multiple receptor tyrosine kinases involved in tumour progression , especially VEGFR 2/3 , PDGFRα/β and c-Kit . We suppose that the combination treatment of osimertinib and anlotinib may ameliorate acquired resistance to osimertinib.This is a multi-center , open , single-arm , exploratory phase 2 trial evaluating osimertinib combined with anlotinib in acquired EGFR T790M mutated NSCLC patients with gradual progression on osimertinib treatment .",2020-06-15,"February 17, 2023","Inclusion Criteria : Ability to provide informed consent , complete all study assessments and have complete medical record .

The SSTS is non-invasive and imposes no restrictions on patient mobility , which renders it particularly suitable for clinical conditions where early mobilization is a key component of successful surgical outcome . The present study tests the hypothesis that SSTS is an efficient and safe analgesic technique allowing fast track rehabilitation after total knee arthroplasty in a prospective cohort design .","Total knee arthroplasty is one of the most common major procedures performed today with a significant impact on health care budgets . Fast track rehabilitation programmes are being developed to control hospitalization costs associated with this procedure . Interestingly , such pathway controlled fast track programs also appear to enhance functional recovery and to reduce complications . These beneficial effects are mainly attributed to the practice of rapid mobilization and early intensified physiotherapy which can only be achieved with effective analgesic techniques . Current PCA techniques - predominantly morphine based - are the gold standard for this purpose but they involve intravenous access and a programmable computer system requiring close supervision . Reported shortcomings are systems failure leading to analgesic gaps , drug errors and restrictions in mobility since patients are tethered to IV poles . The SSTS may overcome these limitations because the opioid used , sufentanil , has a more predictable time of onset , the delivery system does not require programming , and the device does not limit patient 's mobility . It retains the benefits of potent analgesia as well as patient empowerment and is particularly suited to target the analgesic effect precisely to the level required in physiotherapeutic sessions . The present study will test the hypothesis that SSTS is an efficient and safe analgesic technique allowing fast track rehabilitation after total knee arthroplasty in a prospective cohort design . The study will focus on the efficiency of STSS which is defined as 75 % or more of the treated patients proves NRS score less than 4 during 48 hours postoperatively , additionally to the basic pain treatment ( paracetamol and NSAID ) . The STSS will allow the patient tot take a maximum of 3 doses in one hour . Treatment with the STSS is continued over a period of 48 hours or if necessary up to 72 hours .

Acute myocardial infarction is the leading cause of heart failure ( HF ) . It induces myocardial denervation predisposing to ventricular rhythm disorders and death . This denervation linked to infarction 's size occurs by direct ischaemic mechanisms during the initial coronary occlusion ( initially non-vascularised zone ) and secondarily by cardiac remodelling in the context of the heart failure ( HF ) . In usual practice , cardiac denervation which intensity is correlated with rhythm and mortality risks , can be evaluated by scintigraphy . In a murine reperfusion model of ischemia , the direct anti-inflammatory effect of colchicine reduces the size of the necrosis and improves post-ischemic remodeling .

Symptoms vary between people and may be mild to severe . common symptoms include painful and swollen joints , fever , chest pain , hair loss , mouth ulcers , swollen lymph nodes , feeling tired , and a red rash which is most commonly on the face . Often there are periods of illness , called flares , and periods of remission during which there are few symptoms.painless passage of blood or protein in the urine may often be the only presenting sign of kidney involvement . Acute or chronic renal impairment may develop with lupus nephritis , leading to acute or end-stage kidney failure . Because of early recognition and management of SLE , end-stage renal failure occurs in less than 5 % of cases ; except in the black population , where the risk is many times.Nephritis is the most severe manifestation of lupus . Between 1950s and 1970s , corticosteroids were used for the treatment of lupus nephritis ( LN ) , and using of cyclophosphamide ( CPM ) , improved the outcome dramatically with 5 years survival increasing from 17 % to 80 % .Subsequently , intravenous ( iv ) CPM became the standard of care in induction regimes ; however , ivCPM was associated with complications such as bladder toxicity , gonadal problems , and infections . To reduce the toxicity , low-dose of 500mg iv ( CPM ) every two weeks for six months showed equivalent efficacy and less side effect .

NorthShore University HealthSystem,NCT04525898,Intraoperative Methadone for Postoperative Pain Control After Thoracic Surgery,NorthShore University HealthSystem,4,0,Postoperative Pain,Drug,Methadone,Prevention,Quadruple,"Pain following surgery continues to be an important adverse outcome that may impact postoperative recovery . Opioids like fentanyl and hydromorphone are the primary medications used to provide analgesia , but paradoxically , may actually worsen pain when administered in the operating room . Methadone is a unique opioid which has N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor blocking properties , which may prevent the development of opioid-induced tolerance and hyperalgesia ( increased sensitivity to pain induced by a drug ) . Studies have demonstrated that methadone reduces the need for analgesic medications and decreases pain after surgery . Furthermore , the addition of methadone to a standard anesthetic has been demonstrated to increase patient satisfaction with pain management and reduce the need for opioid analgesic medications during the first month after surgery . Some investigators have described methadone as a `` opioid-sparing opioid '' and recommended its use as part of a multimodal pain management strategy . There is a growing interest in reducing the use of traditional opioids in the operating room . The aim of this clinical trial is to compare pain scores and analgesic requirements in two groups of patients ; one group will be randomized to receive a small dose of methadone at the start of surgery . The other group will be randomized to receive an equal volume of saline ( salt water-control group ) at the start of surgery . We hypothesize that patients randomized to be administered methadone at the start of surgery will have less postoperative pain and may require lower doses of pain medications than those given saline-control ..","Despite the development of a number of treatment strategies for pain after surgery , many patients continue to experience moderate-to-severe pain in the early postoperative period . Traditionally , opioids are the primary method of providing analgesia in the operating room , postanesthesia care unit ( PACU ) , intensive care unit , and surgical wards . However , a number of potentially life-threatening complications can develop following opioid administration including severe respiratory depression . In addition , studies have demonstrated an association between the dose of opioid used in the operating room and the intensity of pain after following surgery ; paradoxically , the greater the dose of opioid administered , the higher the reported pain scores are in the early recovery period . This is likely secondary to two interrelated phenomena : tolerance and opioid-induced hyperalgesia . Tolerance , a pharmacologic concept , can develop acutely after a single dose of opioid in the operating room . This can result in increased requirements for postoperative pain medications . Opioid-induced hyperalgesia ( OIH ) , a clinical concept , involves enhancement of existent pain stimuli ( normally minimally painful incisions may feel much worse ) and facilitation of chronic pain development . Therefore , it may be beneficial to use lower doses of intraoperative opioids on all surgical patients . Using a multimodal approach to pain management has been demonstrated to reduce the requirements for postoperative analgesic agents and improve pain scores . A number of different agents have been investigated including gabapentinoids , lidocaine , steroids , and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents . Although it is an opioid , another medication that may be considered as part of a multimodal treatment of pain is methadone . Methadone has several unique properties that may beneficially impact the recovery of the surgical patient . It has been extensively studied as an agent to provide prolonged postoperative analgesia . When larger doses of methadone have been administered intravenously at induction of anesthesia , a median duration of analgesia lasting more than 25 hours has been reported . In patients undergoing abdominal , orthopedic , or gynecologic surgery , the use of a single dose of methadone ( 20 mg or 0.2-0.3 mg/kg ) before surgical incision resulted in improved analgesia for the first 24-48 hours after surgery , when compared to other intraoperative opioids . In these investigations , patients in the methadone groups required significantly less postoperative pain medication and reported lower pain scores during the first or second postoperative days . However , other investigations have demonstrated significant analgesic effects of smaller doses of methadone ( 0.1 to 0.15 mg/kg ) . Furthermore , reductions in pain scores and need for oral opioid medications for the first 30 postoperative days have been observed in surgical patients administered 0.15 mg/kg of methadone . In addition to a long plasma half-life , methadone has other properties which may be advantageous in surgical patients . Recent evidence has demonstrated that methadone has the ability to block N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA ) receptors . NMDA receptors have been implicated in the development of postoperative hyperalgesia ( amplification of pain stimuli ) , and techniques which block NMBA receptors reduce pain . Therefore , methadone may attenuate postoperative pain via this additional mechanism . NMDA receptor stimulation is also thought to play an important role in the development of chronic pain . Although unproven , it has been hypothesized that methadone may reduce the risk of development of chronic postsurgical pain via inhibition of NMDA receptors . No adverse events directly attributable to methadone have been reported in any of the published clinical trials . The aim of this randomized clinical investigation is to assess two cohorts of patients ; one group will receive a dose of methadone at induction of anesthesia ( 0.15 mg/kg ideal body weight ( IBW ) -methadone group ) ) . The other group will be randomized to be administered an equal volume of saline in an identical appearing syringe ( control group ) .. The primary endpoint will be pain scores 24 hours after surgery . Secondary endpoints will include pain scores on arrival and discharge from the postanesthesia care unit ( PACU ) , and at 2 , 6 , 24 , 48 , and 72 hours ( if the patient remains in the hospital ) after surgery . Analgesic requirements in the PACU and surgical wards will be assessed . In addition , the incidence of potential methadone-related side effects will be measured ( delayed emergence , nausea and vomiting , respiratory depression ) ) . Furthermore , methadone has been documented to potentially reduce the incidence of chronic postsurgical pain . A survey with a self-addressed stamped envelope will be provided to patients at 1 , 3 , 6 , and 12 months after surgery to complete to assess the effect of methadone on this important outcome variable .",2020-02-12,"December 6, 2021","Inclusion Criteria : Patients undergoing any thoracoscopic procedure under general anesthesia Exclusion Criteria : American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status 4 or 5 , active heart failure , significant liver disease , previous adverse reactions to methadone , preoperative recent history of opioid or alcohol abuse , renal failure , or inability to comprehend the English language",40,0,18 Years,80 Years

University of Cape Town,NCT04523090,Catalysing the Containment of COVID-19,University of Cape Town,2,0,COVID-19,Drug,Nitazoxanide,Treatment,Triple,"COVID-19 due to SARS-CoV-2 infection is a rapidly escalating global pandemic for which there is no proven effective treatment . COVID-19 is multi-dimensional disease caused by viral cytopathic effects and host-mediated immunopathology . Therapeutic approaches should logically be based on interventions that have direct anti-viral effects and favourably modulate the host immune response . Thus , an optimal drug regimen in ambulatory patients should collectively ( i ) target and reduce viral replication , ( ii ) upregulate host innate immune anti-viral responses , ( iii ) have favourable immunomodulatory properties , and ( iv ) minimise disease progression to hospitalisation thus circumventing the 'cytokine storm ' that likely underpins ARDS and multi-organ failure . Nitazoxanide ( NTZ ) is an antiprotozoal drug that is FDA-approved for treating Cryptosporidium and Giardia and has an excellent safety record for a variety of indications , but primarily as an anti-parasitic agent . It has proven broad anti-viral activity as it amplifies cytoplasmic RNA sensing , potently augments type I interferon and autophagy-mediated anti-viral responses , has immunomodulatory properties e.g inhibits macrophage IL-6 production , and interferes with SARS-CoV-2 glycosylation . It has been shown to have anti-viral activity against several viruses including Ebola , influenza , hepatitis B and C , rotavirus and norovirus . With regard to respiratory viral infections , NTZ was evaluated in uncomplicated influenza and demonstrated a reduction in the median time to symptom recovery . By contrast , NTZ failed to show benefit in hospitalised patients with severe influenza suggesting that , as with oseltamivir ( Tamiflu ) , it likely needs to be administered early in the course of the disease . NTZ has proven in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 . NTZ inhibited the SARS-CoV-2 at a low-micromolar concentrations and in vivo evaluation in patients with COVID-19 has been strongly recommended . NTZ has an excellent drug-drug interaction profile . No clinically significant interactions are expected with commonly used antihypertensive agents , anti-diabetics drugs , antiretroviral agents , steroids or commonly prescribed analgesics/anti-inflammatory agents . The investigators propose NTZ for the treatment of mild COVID-19 in non-hospitalised patients with HIV co-infection and/or enhanced risk for progression to severe disease ( age > 35 years and/or with comorbidity ) . The investigators will perform a randomised controlled trial enrolling 440 patients with mild disease . The primary outcome measure will be the proportion progressing to severe disease ( hospitalisation ) based on the WHO clinical progression scale ( stage 4 and beyond ) . Secondary outcome measures will include disease rates in contacts and effect on viral load , productive infectiousness using viral cultures , and ability to abrogate the generation of infectious aerosols using novel cough aerosol sampling technology . Recruitment is stratified and thus the study is powered to detect progression to severe disease in HIV-infected persons .","COVID-19 that is caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection is a rapidly escalating global pandemic ( 9 ) . The pandemic is on an upward and escalating trajectory in most countries though some countries like China have shown a substantial decrease in the number of new cases being recorded . It is unclear if there will be a second wave of the epidemic . Most cases of COVID-19 are either asymptomatic or have minimal symptoms ( ~80 % ) and act as carriers for disease transmission . Recent longitudinal studies indicate that the SARS-COV-2 viral load in the pharynx is highest during the prodromal phase of COVID-19 . Thus , early therapeutic intervention , prior to respiratory tract dissemination and disease amplification , is likely to be a promising strategy . Although such persons are advised to be in self isolation , many , especially in resource-poor settings ( due to several factors including poverty , overcrowding , environmental conditions , personal beliefs , stigma and human fallibility ) , continue to have contact with others thus fuelling the epidemic . Therefore , reducing the period of infectiousness in ambulatory patients will have major public health impact by shortening the epidemic , thereby reducing morbidity and mortality . Retarding the progression of the 15 to 20 % that will develop more severe disease will have benefits for the public health system , which is struggling to cope with a surge in cases and will thus have a likely impact on mortality . Thus , therapeutic agents that can reduce viral load , viral shedding , the duration of illness and progression to severe disease are urgently needed . It is important to note that HIV-infected persons and certain sub-groups ( including those > 35 years of age , and with comorbidities like diabetes and hypertension etc . ) may have 'enhanced risk ' of disease progression . Collectively such persons would constitute an enhanced risk group and are at the highest risk of disease progression . The risk of disease progression in HIV-infected persons and whether they will respond to the NTZ intervention to the same extent as HIV uninfected persons remains unknown . NTZ is licensed in the USA for treatment of diarrhoea caused by Cryptosporidium parvum and Giardia lamblia . NTZ is a pro-drug for tizoxanide , which also has broad spectrum antiviral properties , has many viral indications and shows promising pharmacodynamics against Coronaviridae . NTZ was identified as a first-in-class broad-spectrum antiviral drug and has been repurposed for the treatment of influenza . In vitro studies evaluating tizoxanide , the active circulating metabolite of NTZ , inhibits the replication of broad range of influenza A and B , HIN1 , H3N2 , H3N2V , H3N8 , H5N9 , H7N1 and oseltamivir resistant strain and coronaviruses . It has been shown to have anti-viral activity against several viruses including Ebola , hepatitis B and C , rotavirus and norovirus . A Phase 2b/3 clinical trial recently published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases found that oral administration of NTZ slow release formulation 600 mg twice daily for five days reduced the duration of clinical symptoms and reduced viral shedding compared to placebo in persons with laboratory-confirmed influenza . These dosages are suitable for treating viral respiratory infections caused by influenza and other viruses as in vitro IC50s are typically between 0.1 and 1ug/mL . The same study also suggested a potential benefit for subjects with influenza-like illness who did not have influenza or other documented respiratory viral infection . The broad-spectrum antiviral activity of tizoxanide is attributed to interference with host regulated pathways involved in viral replication . These pathways include IFN and mTOR1 ( autophagy ) signalling pathways . NTZ upregulates the innate anti-viral mechanisms by broadly amplifying cytoplasmic RNA sensing and type I IFN pathways . It is also a potent driver of autophagy , an antiviral and anti-bacterial mechanism . Thus , NTZ interferes with the viral infection by upregulating the precise host mechanisms that viruses target to bypass host cellular defences . Additionally , NTZ inhibits replication of a broad range of influenza viruses , including neuraminidase inhibitor-resistant strains by blocking the maturation of viral haemagglutinin at the post-translational level . NTZ impairs intracellular trafficking and insertion of viral haemagglutinin into the host plasma membrane . In cell culture studies , NTZ acts synergistically with neuraminidase inhibitors . NTZ may inhibit the glycosylation of the SARS-CoV-2 , similar to its action on the hemagglutinin antigen of the influenza virus . Additionally , NTZ also exhibits inhibitory activity against IL-6 production from murine macrophages both in vitro and in vivo . Moreover , there is a good possibility that diseases associated with IL-6 overproduction ( cytokine storm ) like SARS-CoV-2 could be ameliorated by NTZ . NTZ may be useful for the early treatment of COVID-19 when viral load is at its highest in the pharynx ; and could serve to limit viral shedding thus significantly reducing disease transmission . In the same group it may retard progression to severe disease . Although only 15 to 20 % of patients with COVID-19 may develop severe disease , large numbers of such patients will totally overwhelm healthcare systems as currently being experienced in the USA and the Western Cape province of South Africa . Thus , whether NTZ is useful in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 disease remains unclarified and urgently needs to be addressed . Unreliability with using duration of illness ( pre-symptomatic period is variable and symptom onset is subject to substantial recall bias ) and viral load ( may be different in different anatomical locations and will depend on tolerance and host immunity ) as proxy measures means that the investigators have to embark on a phase IIB/III study to determine whether NTZ effects a clinically meaningful outcome . Study design : A single-stage , double-blinded , randomised , placebo-controlled trial . Primary aim : To evaluate the effectiveness of nitazoxanide ( NTZ ) in reducing the progression from mild to severe COVID-19 in non-hospitalised patients . Significance and impact : The investigators will perform a randomised placebo-controlled trial recruiting 440 mildly symptomatic non-hospitalised COVID-19 patients at multiple sites from 4 cities in South Africa . The primary outcome measure will be time-specific ( 30- and 60-day ) disease severity based on the WHO clinical progression scale . This will have implications for disease transmission and amplification of the epidemic . The rate of progression to severe disease will determine hospitalisation rates , morbidity , and mortality . It will also have implications for reducing healthcare burden , costs and improving healthcare worker safety . The investigators predict that the progression to severe disease ( need for presentation or admission to hospital ) will be reduced with NTZ . As disease progression will more likely occur in those who are HIV-infected or with enhanced risk ( older patients or those with immunosuppression ) , the investigators will stratify randomisation for HIV-infected and enhanced risk patients .",2020-08-20,"August 12, 2022","Inclusion Criteria : Adults > 18 years of age .

Medication assisted treatment , including methadone and buprenorphine , is the standard of care for the treatment of opioid use disorder ( OUD ) . However , chronic pain can reduce treatment efficacy during medication assisted treatment and is associated with illicit substance relapse , dropout , and subsequent overdose . Mechanisms by which chronic pain may influence the impulsive decision making ( e.g. , drug relapse ) in persons with OUD have not been well characterized . A better understanding is needed of decision-making in this population . Two factors that can influence decisions to use drugs are impulsivity and acute opioid withdrawal . This proposal will test how chronic pain is associated with increases in impulsive decision making in OUD , whether impulsive decision making is greater when undergoing opioid withdrawal , and how catastrophizing may modify the association between withdrawal and impulsive decision making in patients with chronic pain and OUD . An ideal population for this developmental research project are methadone maintained patients , who show high treatment attendance rates and will therefore assure study efficiency and reliable completion .",This is an outpatient Phase 1 clinical trial investigating the effect of naloxone precipitated withdrawal on delay discounting . Eligible participants will undergo two experimental sessions presented in random order .

Multiple studies have found that the hyperinflammatory immune response induced by SARS-CoV-2 is one of the main causes of severity and death in infected patients . In severe COVID-19 patients , an association was found between pneumonitis and/or ARDS ( Acute Severe Respiratory Syndrome ) , increased serum levels of cytokines and chemokines , extensive lung damage and microthrombosis . Studies of both gene expression in lungs and blood cytokines and chemokines have related chemokine signaling clusters with COVID-19 severity , being CCL3 , CCL4 and CCL7 ( CC chemokine ligands 3 , 4 and 7 ) particularly interesting . All these are CCR5 ( CC chemokine receptor 5 ) ligands . A strategy to modulate activation and trafficking of leukocytes to the lungs is by blocking CCR5 by using maraviroc ( MVC ) , which has shown capable of modulating conditions of generalized inflammation . Along with a good regulation of the immune response , an antiviral that helps to reduce the viral load must be considered . Favipiravir ( FPV ) has shown to be capable to reduce the time of viral clearance by half . Hence , we propose that the conjoint use of MVC and FPV could help to reduce the progression of severe hospitalized COVID-19 patients to critical by decreasing the percentage of patients in need of mechanical respiratory support or death by at least 30 % . This is a randomized , controlled clinical trial that besides evaluating the safety and efficacy of MVC+FPV to avoid progression in severe COVID-19 patients as a primary endpoint , is also aimed at other secondary endpoints : A ) Evaluate the activation of CCR5 in peripheral blood lymphocytes , monocytes , and neutrophils . B ) Find possible modifications in the ongoing chemokine and cytokine storm in serum , particularly IL-6 , IL-1b , ( interleukins 6 and 1 beta ) TNF ( tumor necrosis factor ) , IFNa , IFNg ( interferons alpha and gamma ) , VEGF ( vascular endothelial growth factor ) , CXCL10 ( CXC chemokine ligand 10 ) , CCL7 , CCL3 , and CCL5 ( CC chemokine ligands 7 , 3 and 5 ) , C ) Search for alterations in the patterns of activation , trafficking , and exhaustion of peripheral blood lymphocytes , monocytes and neutrophils , and D ) Determine if it has an effect in viral loads in saliva . 100 severe patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 will be randomized in 4 treatment arms : Arm A : Currently used therapy ( CT ) only , Enoxaparin , dexamethasone , and antibiotics if associated bacteremia is present , as per currently used at Hospital General de México `` Dr. Eduardo Liceaga '' ) .

In this study , a combination of two drugs that have been shown to be effective against the germ that causes COVID-19 in the laboratory will be tested in patients diagnosed with moderate to severe COVID-19 . One of the drugs is called nitazoxanide and the second is atazanavir/ritonavir . Nitazoxanide has been used for the treatment of diarrhea since 2004 while atazanavir/ritonavir was approved for HIV treatment in 2003 . They are known to be safe in humans . In this pilot study , 98 COVID-19 patients will be recruited into two groups . The 49 patients in group 1 will receive the standard of care determined by their primary care providers while the 49 patients in group 2 will receive both the standard of care combined with the two study drugs . Patients in group 2 will receive the study drugs for 14 days and all patients will be monitored for a total of 28 days . The time it takes for the germ that causes COVID-19 to be completely removed from the body ( in nasal secretions ) and the time to clinical improvement will be monitored in all patients and compared between the two groups .","COVID-19 caused by a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( SARS-CoV-2 ) is an unprecedented global public health challenge which as at July 1 , 2020 has spread to over 210 countries with over 10.6 million cases resulting in 514,808 deaths . More than 1500 clinical trials are currently ongoing in an unprecedented global search for potential therapeutics and vaccines . With increasing number of cases reported in low- and middle-income countries and and the possibility of a second wave of infections in countries where the pandemic appears to have slowed , studies to investigate promising therapies are urgently needed , especially those that can significantly reduce time to viral clearance and mortality . Shortening SARS-CoV-2 clearance time will lower treatment cost and reduce the economic impact of the pandemic . The purpose of this phase 2 trial is to investigate the efficacy and safety of repurposed antiprotozoal and antiretroviral drugs , nitazoxanide and atazanavir/ritonavir , in achievement of SARS-CoV-2 PCR negativity and shorten the time to clinical improvement in patients diagnosed with moderate to severe COVID-19 . The selection of candidates for this COVID-19 drug repurposing trial was guided by three pharmacological considerations : ( 1 ) demonstration of in-vitro anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity at doses shown or predicted to be tolerated by humans , ( 2 ) the feasibility of achieving effective concentration in relevant compartments , and ( 3 ) established human safety record . This is a pilot phase 2 , open label randomized controlled trial . A total of 98 patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis ( defined as SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) positive nasopharyngeal swab ) will be recruited from participating treatment centres . Participants will be randomised to receive either the standard of care ( SOC ) plus nitazoxanide for 14 days , starting from day 1 or the SOC alone for 14 days . Participants will be recruited within 2 days of admission into COVID-19 treatment centre . Before enrollment , they will be given adequate information about the trial , opportunity to ask questions , and sufficient time to consider participation . Before any screening procedures , a written consent will be obtained from each eligible subject who agrees to participate in the trial . Participants will then be randomly allocated 1:1 to receive either the SOC alone ( control group ) or SOC plus study drug ( intervention group ) . Parallel assignment will be used to prevent sample size imbalance between groups and control for important covariates ( e.g . age , comorbidities , gender ) that may affect trial results . Participants in the intervention group will receive 1000 mg nitazoxanide ( two tablets of 500 mg each ) with meal two times daily ( 8 am and 8 pm ) and one tablet of 300/100 mg atazanavir/ritonavir with meal once daily ( 8 pm ) in addition SOC . Participants in the control arm will receive the SOC alone . SOC will be as determined by the clinical team at the treatment centres in line with the current National Interim Guidelines for Clinical Management of COVID-19 . The treatment duration for participants in the intervention group will be 14 days . However , follow up will continue until day 28 after study entry at the end of which all participants will exit the study . Evaluations at follow up visits will include daily symptoms monitoring using inFLUenza Patient-Reported Outcome ( FLU-PRO ) questionnaire , daily vitals , daily clinical improvement assessment , and swab and/or sputum collection for SARS-CoV-2 on days 2 , 4 , 6 , 7 , 14 , and 28 . Sample size estimation is based on the assumption that an improvement of at least 60-80 % in time to SARS-CoV-2 PCR negativity and symptoms resolution can be achieved in the intervention group compared with the control group . Hence , a total sample size of 89 will provide at least 80 % power to show or exclude 60 % improvement in time to SARS-CoV-2 PCR negativity . This assumes a two-sided and 5 % type 1 error rate . Therefore , providing for a 10 % loss to follow up rate , a total of 98 patients will be recruited .",2020-07-03,"February 14, 2022","Inclusion Criteria : Willingness and ability to provide written informed consent At least 18 and not more than 75 years of age at study entry SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by PCR test within 4 days before randomization Currently symptomatic ( fever or chills , cough , myalgia , sore throat , shortness of breath , or new onset of anosmia or ageusia ) and at COVID-19 isolation and treatment centre Exclusion Criteria : Inability to take orally administered medication or food Known hypersensitivity to study medication Pregnant or lactating ( unless practicing exclusive replacement feeding for the entire study duration ) Participation in any other interventional trial for COVID-19 ( observational study co-enrollment allowed ) Concurrent treatment with other agents with actual or possible direct-acting antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 less than 24 hours prior to study drug dosing Concurrent use of agents with known or uncertain interaction with study drugs , including ritonavir Requiring mechanical ventilation at screening Alanine Aminotransferase ( ALT ) or aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) above 5 times upper limit of normal ( ULN ) Creatinine clearance below 50 mL/min using the Cockcroft-Gault formula for participants above 18 years of age",57,0,18 Years,75 Years
University of Kentucky,NCT04454281,Topical Naloxone to Diagnose Ocular Pain,Seema Capoor,1,1,Dry Eye Syndromes,Drug,Naloxone Hydrochloride 0.4 MG/ML,Diagnostic,Triple,Chronic ocular neuropathic pain may be misdiagnosed as dry eye disease . Our study aims to identify a population with previous monocular trauma and dry eye symptoms and differentiate neuropathic from dry eye pain using topical corneal naloxone hydrochloride .,"Dry eye is a ubiquitous and debilitating ocular condition that affects tens of millions in the United States ( DEWS , 2007 ) . However , there is increasing evidence that the symptoms of dry eye overlap with the distinct condition of ocular neuropathic pain , and that many patients given a dry eye diagnosis are mislabeled ( Galor , 2017 ) . These shared symptoms include but are not limited to : hypoesthesia , hyperalgesia , and allodynia . According to the 2017 DEWS II ( Dry Eye Workshop ) pain and sensation report by the Tear Film and Ocular Surface Society , neuropathic pain can manifest itself in the eye and may present similarly to dry eye , but should not be classified as such ( Belmonte , 2017 ) . Our study aims to further characterize this distinction by translating the rodent model of latent sensitization to the human eye . Latent sensitization is a model of chronic pain that reproduces both its episodic nature and its sensitivity to stress . It can be induced by an array of insults and follows a characteristic time course in which a hyperalgesic pain phase is followed by pain remission phase . Of clinical relevance , administration of mu-opioid antagonists ( i.e . naloxone ) during the remission phase reinstates animal pain behavior and physiologic reflexes to peak levels seen in the hyperalgesia phase ( Marvizon , 2015 ) . This phenomenon suggests that the animals are in a state of latent sensitization that can be unmasked by blocking the activity of the opioid signaling pathway through compounds like naloxone hydrochloride . Furthermore , the undulating course of chronic pain syndromes can be mimicked by introducing environmental and physical stressors that trigger and exacerbate pain states ( Marvizon , 2015 ) . Neuropathic pain is a common cause of chronic pain . It is defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain as pain that arises as a direct consequence of a lesion or disease affecting the somatosensory system . In contrast , nociceptive pain is produced by the normal function of nociceptors . Hence , neuropathic lesions do not necessarily involve the nociceptive pathway ; instead , they can involve other somatosensory pathways including tactile , mechanical , and thermal pathways . These lesions manifest allodynia-a central pain sensation following a normally non-painful stimuli and a clinical hallmark of neuropathic pain . In the eye , allodynia may manifest as non-specific dry-eye-like-symptoms to stimuli including wind , temperature change , and humidity ( Galor , 2017 ) . Hyperalgesia is a heightened pain sensation to a normally painful stimulus and is another hallmark of neuropathic pain . Importantly , hyperalgesia is a symptom of both neuropathic and nociceptive pain , however the pathophysiologies are distinct . Neuropathic hyperalgesia is a sustained phenomenon that arises from neuronal remodeling and sensitization of nociceptive peripheral and/or central nerves . In distinction , nociceptive hyperalgesia arises from inflammatory cytokine mediators that sensitize nociceptors and resolves after the conclusion of inflammation . Given all of this , it can be difficult to clinically differentiate the two forms of hyperalgesia ; similarly , it can be difficult to differentiate between neuropathic and nociceptive pain . In our murine model ( Cho , 2019 ) , we study latent sensitization of the eye after injuring the cornea with an alkali solution . We find that pain behavior ( quantified by the number of eye wipes in thirty seconds after the topical administration of 2M NaCl to the corneal surface ) peaks at day 10 post injury and returns to baseline by day 14 post injury ( figure 3.1 ; next page ) . Topical administration of naloxone ( 100uM , one drop ) , reinstated peak pain behavior 16 weeks after initial corneal surface injury ( figure 3.2 ; next page ) . We hypothesize that our patient population with monocular trauma and dry eye symptoms mirrors our murine model . The monocular trauma represents the initial corneal surface injury , and the dry eye symptoms represent the breakthrough pain . It is important to note that in other models of latent sensitization , peak pain responses can be reinstated by stressors other than opioid antagonism . Specifically , novel environment stressors and forced swims reproduce peak pain behavior experienced in the hyperalgesic phase . In a similar way , our patient population endorses exacerbation of dry eye symptoms in the setting of stress , sleep , and environmental changes . Our study aims to differentiate dry eye disease from ocular neuropathic pain by testing the latent sensitization model in the human eye . Given that there is good data to suggest chronic pain states , including our ocular model , can be masked by upregulation of the mu-opioid receptor signaling pathway , we hypothesize that our naloxone hydrochloride drop will induce a hyperalgesic response to hypertonic saline in a population with dry eye diagnosis and monocular trauma . We believe a topical naloxone ophthalmic drop is a potentially easy , cheap , and safe diagnostic tool for ocular neuropathic pain .",2020-06-24,"November 4, 2022","Inclusion Criteria : monocular trauma dry eye disease diagnosis Exclusion Criteria : any pathology that might contribute to ocular pain , including corneal surface ulcers , uveitis , or other chronic inflammatory processes any current corneal surface pathology history of bilateral ocular trauma currently taking any of the following medications : TCAs , opioids , gabapentin , SNRIs pregnant nor breastfeeding .",1,0,18 Years,65 Years

We hypothesized that early use of corticosteroids , low dose , in mild disease , can decrease progression to respiratory failure and death .","We are in the middle of a coronavirus pandemic , facing a large number of infections in serious cases and an increasing number of deaths in Chile . As of June 11 , 2020 , there are 154092 cases confirmed by COVID - 19 i and 2648 deaths in our country . Most patients have mild disease , but older people and those with comorbidities can develop severe disease that requires hospitalization , some form of ventilatory support , and eventually intensive care unit admission . The pathophysiology occurs in two different overlapping phases , the initial pathogen with viral replication , followed by the host 's inflammatory response with varying degrees of severity associated with different clinical characteristics . The pathological progression in some cases of severe COVID-19 would be explained by an excess of proinflammatory cytokines , which leads to diffuse alveolar damage , with the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) and inflammatory compromise of multiple systems until death . In the absence of any proven antiviral therapy , current clinical treatment is primarily supportive care , supplemental oxygen , and mechanical ventilatory support . Clinical trials have been published and called to demonstrate the usefulness of therapies in the context of this pandemic . The role of corticosteroids is not fully defined . Observational studies report better results in decreasing disease progression in those COVID-19 patients who received corticosteroids early . We hypothesize in this study that treatment in mild disease ( defined as that requiring supplemental oxygen , but without the need for ventilatory support ) can attenuate the host 's excessive respiratory and systemic inflammatory responses . The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of early treatment with prednisone to decrease the progression of the disease .",2020-06-26,"May 30, 2021",Inclusion Criteria : 18 years or more COVID-19 confirmed by PCR Oxygen requirements until 35 % by venturi mask or 5 lt minutes by nasal cannula Consent form signed Exclusion Criteria : Previous steroid use 48 hours or more .

Kinderkrankenhaus auf der Bult,NCT04234867,Study to Explore the Effect of Dapagliflozin and Stress in Adolescent and Adult Subjects With Type 1 Diabetes (T1D),Kinderkrankenhaus auf der Bult,1,0,Type 1 Diabetes,Drug,Dapagliflozin,Treatment,Triple,"Type 1 Diabetes is characterized by an absolute lack of insulin caused by autoimmune ß-cell destruction . Looking for different therapeutic approaches , beyond the administration of Insulin SGLT-Inhibitors ( SGLT=sodium-glucose cotransporter ) like Dapagliflozin look like a promising option to avoid hyperglycaemic excursions which are a reason for glycaemic variability by renal excretion of excessive glucose without administration of extra insulin . But also euglycemic DKA has been reported during SGLT2 add-on therapy to insulin in T1D and mechanistic studies have been called for . The role of Dapagliflozin-induced hyperglucagonemia and stress/infection precipitating euglycemic DKA in this situation is unclear . Thus the purpose of this pilot study is to collect clinical data on the development of DKA after insulin-withdrawal with Dapagliflozin compared to placebo and the added effect of a single dose of 4mg/kg i.v . ACTH as mediator of stress . The first objective is to investigate the time to DKA ( defined as Bicarbonate < 19 mmol/l ) after insulin withdrawal during treatment with a stable 5 day single daily dose of 10mg Dapagliflozin in patients with type 1 Diabetes . In addition it should be evaluate the additional effect of stress , modelled by a single injection of ACTH on DKA development during Dapagliflozin Treatment . We also want to know if Dapagliflozin influences glucagon levels during insulin withdrawal and how this is associated with the time course of DKA development .","The purpose of the Dapastress trial is , to evaluate if some metabolic parameters can be identified as an early marker or contributor in development of ketonic metabolic imbalance . As the hormonal `` background '' is completely different in pubertal adolescents compared to adults ( especially contra-insulin hormones as growth hormone , glucagon ) . Approximately 20 subjects 18-45 years will be screened in order to randomize 16 patients , where stress and Dapagliflozin ( or corresponding placebo ) will be administered independently . The trial will consist of 14 visits : a screening visit ( Visit 1 ) , 4 overnight visits complexes ( Visit 2 to Visit 13 ) , including phone visits and a follow-up visit ( Visit 14 ) . Furthermore , an information visit will take place prior to the screening visit in order to obtain patient 's informed consent . Screening will take place 2-21 days prior to Visit 2 . The follow-up visit will take place 5-21 days after the end of Visit 13 . The overnight visits will be separated by a wash-out period ( 5-30 days between the end of each visit complex and start of next complex ) during which the subjects will resume their normal insulin treatment . Each phone visit will take place 3-5 days after the end of overnight Visits . The planned total duration of the trial is 58-100 days per subject ( rescheduled visits excluded ) . Each subject will be randomised to a unique treatment sequence ( 1:1:1:1 ) . Seq 1 : A D B C Seq 2 : B A C D Seq 3 : C B D A Seq 4 : D C A B ( e.g . A Dapa-Stress , B Dapa-Placebo Stress , C Placebo- Stress , D Placebo-Placebo Stress ) After randomization patients will receive Dapagliflozin/placebo for 5 single daily Dosis . During the overnight visits the metabolic control will be achieved by a variable i.v . Infusion of human Insulin by an Infusion pump . The procedure will be used in order to aim and maintain blood glucose levels between 70 and 180 mg/dl . The fluid Infusion and Insulin dosing scheme will depend on Body weight and blood glucose levels . At approximately 03:00 hours in the morning the blood glucose should be within target range . Then insulin infusion will be suspended . In the morning the last dose of actual study medication ( Dapagliflozin/ Placebo ) and the single dose of stress ( ACTH or placebo ) will be administered . During now started stress phase blood samples for determination of metabolic Panels , blood gas analysis , Glucose and ketone will be taken hourly and vital signs tested . 12 hours after administration of stress ( ACTH or placebo ) the patients will resume their CSII and will be discharged when being well on investigator 's judgement .",2020-01-16,"June 2, 2023","Inclusion Criteria : Provision of informed consent from participant and all legal representatives prior to any study specific procedures Age : Female and/or male aged > 18 years Subject must have type 1 diabetes ( as diagnosed clinically ) ≥ 12 months HbA1c 0.5 nmol/l Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) > 2X Upper limit of normal ( ULN ) Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) > 2X ULN Serum total bilirubin > 2X ULN ( except known Gilbert 's disease ) Creatine kinase ( CK ) > 3X ULN Estimated GFR ( eGFR ) by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease ( MDRD ) formula ≤ 60 ml/min/1.73m2 .

So , the current phase III clinical trial study was conducted to measure the preventive effects of the aforementioned boron-based gel on different outcomes . Design : The parallel design , randomized , double blinded and placebo controlled phase III clinical trial was conducted . One-hundred-eighty-one and seventy-six patients aged 18-75 years were assigned to intervention and placebo groups respectively . Patients in intervention and placebo groups received daily a gel containing 3 % sodium pentaborate pentahydrate and gel free of any chemical treatment respectively 15 minutes before the RT session . Dermatitis , erythema , dry desquamation , moist desquamation and necrosis were compared between two groups in terms of percent and number needed to treat . Settings and conduct : The female breast cancer patients who admitted to the Shahid Madani Hospital were initially assessed during 2018-2019 and those aged 18-75 years old with no previous history of radiotherapy were invited to the study . Pregnant women , patients with unknown dermatitis and those without any willing to participate in this study were excluded . As there was no similar study to compare our outcome studied , we included 30 patients in the pilot study . Afterwards , the sample size of 16 were calculated for each group based on the erythema to ensure the power of 0.8 and type I error of 0.05 . However , we increased the sample size of the study to 181 and 76 subjects in intervention and placebo groups respectively to meet the sample size guidelines for Food and Drug Administration Phase III Clinical Trial Studies , address at least 20 % attrition rate during the study , and to enhance the randomization efficiency in balancing the patterns of confounding variables between intervention and placebo groups .

Baylor College of Medicine,NCT04371536,Oral Iron Versus Oral Iron Plus a Web-based Behavioral Intervention in Young Children (IRONCHILD),Baylor College of Medicine,3,1,Iron Deficiency Anemia,Drug,Ferrous Sulfate,Treatment,,"Iron deficiency anemia ( IDA ) affects nearly half a million young children in the United States . Most children take liquid iron medicine by mouth for at least 3 months . However , some children take longer to get better with this medicine . This study is trying to compare different ways of giving iron medicine to young children . For young children in the US , the main cause of IDA is nutritional , or not having enough iron in the foods they eat . This often happens when kids drink too much cow milk and/or not eating enough foods that have a lot of iron . Iron deficiency is most common in children ages 1 to 4 years of age , during a time that is important for brain development . More severe and long-lasting IDA is associated with worse brain development outcomes . That is why researchers want to understand the fastest way for kids with IDA to get better . Standard treatment is oral iron medicine for 3 to 6 months . Many children do not take their iron medicine the full amount of time needed because of side effects like abdominal discomfort , nausea , constipation , and bad taste . Different factors can contribute to patients not completing their IDA therapy . Many families do not understand how important it is to treat IDA or do not have the motivation to continue the medication . This study will offer different methods for treating IDA , including a different method to taking the oral iron therapy . This new method gives oral iron by increasing a family 's understanding and motivation . Another research study that interviewed families of young children with IDA found ways that helped the patients to continue their therapy . Using that information , a website called IRONCHILD was created to help motivate parents to get their children to continue the oral iron medicine . Research studies that compare these different IDA treatment methods in young children are needed and could have benefits to short-term clinical and long-term brain development . However , we do not know whether families of young children with IDA will be willing to participate in this type of study that has different treatment methods ( oral iron therapy and oral iron therapy with a web-based adherence intervention ) . The goal of this clinical research study is to learn which of the two methods of care will be the best way for children with iron deficiency anemia to receive therapy .","First , the doctor will confirm that patients are eligible for the study . Patients will complete the following procedures : Medical history including prior hospitalizations , lab results , medications , diet , social and family history Comprehensive Physical Examination which includes measurement of vital signs , examination of the head , eyes , ears , nose , mouth , heart , lungs , abdomen , and skin . Blood samples : Patients will not have any extra blood draws for this study , as the investigators will draw the blood during routine blood draws . Investigators will ask to take a little extra blood ( less than half a teaspoon ) for research tests . All other blood draws that patients have while on study will be for routine care and not for research purposes . Patients will be on the study for 12 weeks . Patients will receive dietary counseling on the amount of cow milk they may have and information sheets on iron-rich foods . There are 2 different treatments in this study and patients can not choose which treatment they receive . Instead , they will be randomly assigned to one of the two treatments . That means there is a 50-50 chance that patients will receive liquid iron medicine by itself or that patients will receive liquid iron medicine with access to the website . Depending on which method of care patients are assigned to , they will complete the following procedures below .

Our Lady of the Lake Hospital,NCT04377204,The Utility of Long-acting Local Anesthetic Agents in Reducing Post-operative Opioid Requirements Following Rhinoplasty,Our Lady of the Lake Hospital,0,1,"Pain, Postoperative",Drug,marcaine bupivacaine,Prevention,Single,"On average , more than 130 Americans die every day from opioid overdose . Surgeons provide 37 % of all opioid prescriptions in the United states , second only behind pain management physicians . A recent report found that patients who receive a 5-day supply of opioid medication have a 10 % chance of using opioids 12 months later . Additionally , studies have shown that many opioid abusers are not the intended recipient , with over half diverting them from friends and family . Rhinoplasty is one of the most common procedures performed by facial plastic surgeons , with over 215,000 performed in the United States in 2017 . Patients undergoing nasal surgery have been shown to be at significant risk for persistent and prolonged opioid use after filling an opioid prescription in the perioperative period . Thus , the management of postoperative pain without contributing to the opioid epidemic is a imperative . The first three days following nasal surgery are generally associated with considerable pain , with the highest levels occuring within the initial 24 hours . Published studies have demonstrated the benefit of non-opioid medications following rhinoplasty , such as pregabalin and celecoxib . There has also been growing recognition of the benefits of `` pre-emptive analgesia , '' such as the use of local anesthesia , which not only helps control pain , but in turn decreases the anxiety caused by pain and can prevent patient turning to narcotics to break the cycle . These studies have predominantly focused on the immediate postoperative period , e.g . the first 24 hours . Currently , many surgeons use lidocaine with 1 % epinephrine as local anesthesia for rhinoplasty due to its widespread availability , rapid time to onset , and safety profile . Several studies have shown the benefit of Marcaine bupivacaine over lidocaine for pain control and opioid consumption during the first 24 hours after surgery . This is not surprising , as the half-life of lidocaine is approximately 90 minutes in a healthy individual , compared to 160 minutes for Marcaine bupivacaine . However , there are no studies to date that have evaluated the effect that long-acting local anesthesia has on post-operative opioid consumption past the first 24 hours after surgery . Our study aims to compare total postoperative opioid use for patients who received lidocaine as local anesthesia at the time of surgery versus a mixture of lidocaine and Marcaine bupivacaine .","The local anesthesia regimen administered prior to surgery is a standard practice for rhinoplasty procedures . However , there is variation in the kind of anesthetic utilized during this time . In our practice , we have used different combinations along with epinephrine which include lidocaine or lidocaine with Marcaine bupivacaine dilutions . Although both are effective at pre-operative local numbing , investigators have seen less reported pain outcomes as perceived by the patient feedback . Therefore , investigators aim to identify specifically the usage of post-operative pain medication with those who had an epinephrine/lidocaine local anesthetic vs. those who had the epi/lidocaine/bupivacaine combination . Patients will be informed about the study and consented for participation . They will be randomized pre-operatively by permuted block assignment to the control treatment ( 1 % lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine ) or the study treatment ( 1 % lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine mixed 1:1 with 0.5 % Marcaine bupivacaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine ) using a predetermined weight-calculated maximum dosage that would be safe for injection of either anesthesia . As per standard procedure , the patients will be premedicated with a standardized dose of versed if determined necessary by anesthesia . Anesthesia will be induced utilizing weight based dosing of propofol and rocuronium . Intraoperative anesthesia will be maintained utilizing total intravenous anesthesia ( propofol , fentanyl/remifentanyl doses ) . All patients will be given antibiotics ( weight based dosing , Ancef or Clindamycin ) and 8mg of dexamethasone prior to skin incision . Once anesthesia has been induced , the nose will be injected with local anesthesia as follows : transcutaneous to the bilateral dorsal nasal and the angular neurovascular bundles , transcutaneously along the columella and nasal dorsum , transnasally along the nasal dorsum and ala , the bilateral nasal septum , and the inferior turbinates with a total dose of 10ml 's . Topical decongestion and anesthesia will then be obtained with 3 x 0.5cm cottonoids soaked with 4 % cocaine placed bilaterally . A standard external rhinoplasty approach will the be performed , and grafting done as necessary . At then end of the procedure , Doyle nasal septal splints will be placed ( Reuter-Bivalves if alar grafting performed ) . In the immediate post-operative period , pain will be controlled with short acting analgesics ( standardized regimen for all patients to be decided with anesthesia team ) while in the acute care setting and recorded again as per standard of care . Once discharged from acute care , the patient will be given instructions to control their pain with acetaminophen ( 1000mg every 8 hours ) scheduled during the first 72 hours , then as needed thereafter . They will also be given a prescription for oxycodone ( 15 tablets ) with instruction to take 5mg every 6 hours as needed for breakthrough pain . They will be provided a pain diary for the first 24 hours to record their pain using the Faces scale ( ranging 1-10 with 1 being no pain up to 10 being the worst pain ever experienced ) at the 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 12 , and 24 hours marks after discharge from surgery .

The first case of this unprecedented outbreak `` pneumonia of unknown etiology '' was reported in Wuhan City , Hubei Province , China on December 8th , 2019 and reported to the World Health Organization ( WHO ) on December 31st , 2019. WHO declared a COVID-19 global emergency on January 30 , 2020 , and then categorized the outbreak as a pandemic on March 11 , 2020 . As of April 22 , 2020 , more than 2,628,894 confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide and 182,740 people globally have died from COVID-19 since it emerged in China , according to the data from Johns Hopkins University . While the majority of patients with COVID-19 develop mild or uncomplicated illness , approximately 20-30 % of hospitalized patients have required intensive care support and 5 % of those have multi-organ failure or shock . The case fatality rate ranges from 1 to 4 % and it is higher among those with pre-existing comorbid conditions such as cardiovascular disease , diabetes mellitus , obesity , chronic respiratory disease , hypertension and cancer .

There is increasing indication that the decompensation in severe COVD-19 infection may be due to a cytokine storm syndrome . This hyperinflammatory syndrome results in a fulminant and fatal hypercytokinemia and multiorgan failure . Approximately 15 % of patients with COVID-19 infection are hospitalized and 20-30 % of these hospitalized patients require ICU care and/or mechanical ventilation . Overall mortality in hospitalized patients is approximately 20-25 % .

Emerging evidence suggests that a subset of patients with COVID-19 develops a cytokine storm syndrome that is associated with elevation of pro-inflammatory cytokines . Catecholamines enhance inflammatory injury by augmenting the production of IL-6 and other cytokines through a self-amplifying feed-forward loop in immune cells that requires alpha-1 adrenergic receptor ( ⍺1-AR ) signaling . The ⍺1-AR antagonist prazosin prevents cytokine storm and markedly increased survival following inflammatory stimuli in preclinical models . In a retrospective study of outcomes in acute respiratory distress syndrome or pneumonia , patients who were taking ⍺1-AR antagonists had significantly lower probability of needing invasive mechanical ventilation and dying in the hospital compared to non-users . Prazosin may blunt surges in catecholamines and self-amplifying cytokine production ( including interleukin 6 ) and , as an early preemptive therapy in patients prior to disease progression , may prevent cytokine storm syndrome and severe complications of COVID-19 . In this study , patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 testing who are hospitalized ( but are not requiring more than 4 liters/minute of supplemental oxygen by nasal cannula ) will be screened for eligibility .

The majority of patients ( 8 out of 10 ) are known to have mild disease , manifested by respiratory tract symptoms associated with fever , headache , and body pain . However , it is possible that the disease progresses to a severe stage , whith the need for mechanical ventilation support associated with high morbidity and mortality . The progression of the disease is mainly due to the appearance of uncontrolled inflammation that also favors the development of disseminated clots . So far , there is no effective treatment to combat coronavirus ; however , the use of anti-inflammatory drugs is potentially effective in preventing complications from the disease . In this regard , low dose colchicine is relatively safe and effective as an anti-inflammatory . It has been used for many years in the control of inflammation secondary to the accumulation of uric acid crystals . The aim of this study is to test if the administration of colchicine at a dose of 1.5 mg the first day and subsequently 0.5 mg BID until completing 10 days of treatment is effective as a treatment for inflammation related symptoms in patients with mild and severe disease secondary to coronavirus infection . The primary outcome is improvement of symptoms related to inflammation and avoiding progression to severe and critical stages of the disease . Colchicine can be discontinued before the end of 10 days in case of serious adverse effects or if the patient progresses to the critical stages of the disease .","This a placebo-controlled double-blind clinical trial to test the efficacy and security of colchicine 1.5 mg at day one followed by 0.5 mg BID to complete 10 days of treatment .

APR Applied Pharma Research s.a.,NCT04360096,Inhaled ZYESAMI™ (Aviptadil Acetate) for the Treatment of Severe COVID-19,APR Applied Pharma Research s.a.,2,0,SARS-CoV 2,Drug,ZYESAMI™ (aviptadil acetate),Treatment,Quadruple,"Brief Summary : SARS-CoV-2 virus infection is known to cause Lung Injury that begins as dyspnea and exercise intolerance , but may rapidly progress to Critical COVID-19 with Respiratory Failure and the need for noninvasive or mechanical ventilation . Mortality rates as high as 80 % have been reported among those who require mechanical ventilation , despite best available intensive care . Patients with severe COVID-19 by FDA definition who have not developed respiratory failure be treated with nebulized ZYESAMI™ ( aviptadil acetate , a synthetic version of Vasoactive Intestinal Polypeptide ( VIP ) ) 100 μg 3x daily plus Standard of Care vs. placebo + Standard of Care using an FDA 501 ( k ) cleared mesh nebulizer . The primary outcome will be progression in severity of COVID-19 ( i.e . critical OR severe progressing to critical ) over 28 days . Secondary outcomes will include blood oxygenation as measured by pulse oximetry , dyspnea , exercise tolerance , and levels of TNFα IL-6 and other cytokines .","Detailed Description : Attack of the Alveolar Type II ( ATII ) cell via its ACE2 surface receptor by the SARS-CoV-2 virus leads to respiratory failure , morbidity , and frequently mortality in COVID-19 . There is no approved treatment that specifically targets the pulmonary injury . Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide ( VIP ) is known to target the VPAC1 receptor of the ATII cell and to protect that cell against all manner of injuries , including smoke inhalation , exposure to stomach acid , and exposure to infectious agents . VIP prevents apoptosis , blocks cytokines , lowers TNFα levels , reverses CD4/CD8 ratio , and reduces cough and dyspnea in nonclinical and clinical studies . Aviptadil acetate , a synthetic form of Vasoactive Intestinal Polypeptide ( VIP ) has been awarded FDA Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of ARDS and Pulmonary Hypertension and EMEA Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of ARDS and Sarcoid . ZYESAMI™ ( Aviptadil ) has been granted FDA Fast Track Designation for the treatment of ARDS/Acute Lung Injury in COVID-19 . The objective of this study is to identify patients severe COVID-19 who have not yet developed respiratory failure and to treat them with inhaled ZYESAMI™ in the hope of preventing progression to Critical COVID-19 with Respiratory Failure . Nonclinical studies demonstrate that VIP is 70 % concentrated in the lung , where it binds primarily to ATII cells . VIP prevents NMDA-induced caspase-3 activation in the lung , inhibits IL6 and TNFα production , protects against HCl-induced pulmonary edema , These and other effects have been observed in numerous animal model systems of lung injury in mice , rats , guinea pigs , sheep , swine , and dogs . In these models , Aviptadil restores barrier function at the endothelial/alveolar interface and thereby protects the lung and other organs from failure . Both intravenous and inhalation preclinical toxicology and safety pharmacology have been performed in four species , with a six-month trial of inhaled Aviptadil in primates . Aviptadil is approved for human use in the treatment of erectile dysfunction in Scandinavia and several European countries in co-formulation with phentolamine and has a demonstrated phase 2 safety in trials for Sarcoid , Pulmonary Fibrosis , and Bronchospasm . No adverse safety signals were seen in a phase I trial IV Aviptadil in ARDS . In that phase I trial , 8 patients with severe ARDS on mechanical ventilation were treated with ascending doses of VIP . Seven of the 8 patients were successfully extubated and were alive at the five-day timepoint . Six left the hospital and one died of an unrelated cardiac event . A 60-day phase 2b/3 trial of IV Aviptadil ( NCT 04311697 ) has recently completed enrollment and 28-day top-line safety data have been reported . No unanticipated serious adverse events were reported . The only adverse event that was statistically more frequent in Aviptadil-treated participants than among placebo-treated participants was mild to moderate diarrhea , which has not been reported as a frequent side-effect of inhaled Aviptadil ( 30 % vs 1.5 % ; p < .001 ) . Systemic hypotension was seen in both Aviptadil-treated and placebo-treated participants ( 25 % vs 18.5 % ; P=NS ) . Five GCP phase 2 trials of Aviptadil were conducted under European regulatory authority . Non GCP healthy volunteer studies have shown that i.v . infusion of Aviptadil is well tolerated with few adverse effects including alterations in blood pressure , heart rate , or ECG . In addition to published studies of human use , Aviptadil has been used on a compounded basis in certain ICUs for many years in the belief that it preserves life and restores function in pulmonary hypertension , ARDS , and Acute Lung Injury ( ALI ) . In this study , patients with severe COVID-19 by FDA definition who have not developed respiratory failure will be treated with nebulized ZYESAMI™ 100 μg in 1 cc normal saline 3x daily plus Standard of Care vs. placebo + Standard of Care using an FDA 501 ( k ) cleared mesh nebulizer .

UMC Utrecht,NCT04362332,"Chloroquine, Hydroxychloroquine or Only Supportive Care in Patients AdmItted With Moderate to Severe COVID-19",UMC Utrecht,4,0,COVID-19,Drug,Chloroquine Sulfate,Treatment,,"Rationale : Currently there are no approved treatments for COVID-19 . In the Dutch treatment protocol guideline ( SWAB ) designated treatment is supportive care with the option to add chloroquine base ( CQ ) or hydroxychloroquine ( HCQ ) . CQ and HCQ are implemented because of their in vitro activity , results from small animal studies , and anecdotal patient 's data . There are no published randomized studies with these medications in patients with disease caused by any coronavirus . Objective : To evaluate if treatment with only supportive care or addition of one of two anti-COVID_19 agents ( chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine ) results in less disease progression in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 who require hospital admission . Study design : Multicentre , cluster randomized cross-over , open label trial . Hospitals will be randomly allocated to one of 3 treatment arms in sequential periods of one week : chloroquine base versus hydroxychloroquine versus supportive care without any drug presumed active against SARS-COV-2 . Patients will be treated based on the date of inclusion . Study population : Adults aged of 18 years and older with moderate to severe , with a NEWS-2 score ≤ 5 , laboratory confirmed COVID-19 , who require hospital admission in a ward outside the Medium Care or Intensive Care . Intervention ( if applicable ) : Depending on the treatment arm , the study subject will receive only supportive care or an addition with one of the two agents active against SARS-CoV-2 ( chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine ) . Main study parameters/endpoints : Disease progression defined as a NEWS-2 score ≥ 7 within 14 days , or admission to Medium Care or Intensive Care Unit , or death .","Study rationale CQ and HCQ were both employed in the treatment of COVID-19 in China . Based on unpublished anecdotal positive results in China , CQ is now implemented in China and the Netherlands in severe COVID-19 . HCQ is an analog of CQ with more anti-viral effectivity ex vivo , better safety and tolerability profile . Rationale for the employment of CQ and HCQ in China comes from the fact that both reduce COVID-19 replication ex-vivo . On top of this , both drugs have clear immunomodulating effects ( which is used for various indications to treat rheumatologic diseases ) and have shown promising results in patients with dengue and HIV . Currently , in the Dutch guidelines , for moderate severely ill patients CQ base is the first line of therapy for patients admitted in hospital with moderate to severe COVID-19 . The time needed to `` load '' the body when using CQ and thus the possible late onset of action suggests that initiation of treatment should be timely . Moreover , the hypothesized mode of action suggests that both HCQ and CQ inhibit cellular replication of COVID-19 but do not have an intrinsic effect on the virus , thus could be best employed when the viral load is low ( i.e . early phase of the disease ) and thus safe time to improve the subsequent immune response . This underlines that both drugs should be implemented early rather than late in the course of SARS-COV-2 infection . The investigators propose a cluster randomized controlled study evaluating the value of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine compared to no antiviral therapy in admitted patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 . Study design : Population Adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 , with moderate to severe symptoms and admitted to the hospital and a NEWS-2 score ≤ 5 , will be available for the study . Intervention All three treatment arms contain standard supportive care during hospital admission with in two arms an addition with either chloroquine ( CQ ) or hydroxychloroquine ( HCQ ) Despite the inclusion of CQ and HCQ as possible additional treatment for COVID-19 in the Dutch treatment guideline , there 's no conclusion on the best treatment strategy in this population . Based on pharmacokinetic modelling , and the safety profile , HCQ seems to be more promising than CQ , but both drugs have to be studied in relation to COVID-19 . Furthermore , the availability of both drugs might differ from country to country ; in the Netherlands for instance , chloroquine is widely available . Therefore , a 1:1:1 trial including standard supportive care with in addition CQ or HCQ as suggested in the LCI/SWAB guideline , the optimal dosages in the different treatment arms are as follows : Supportive care + chloroquine base arm : loading dose 600mg , followed by 300mg 12 hours later , followed by 300mg bid for 4 days ; total treatment duration of 5 days Supportive care + hydroxychloroquine arm : loading dose 400mg bid , followed by 200mg bid for 4 days ; total treatment duration of 5 days . Supportive care only . Dosage of chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine will be adjusted , if the patients has a renal impairment with an estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGDR ) < 10 , to 50 % of the initial dosage . If patient will be discharged from hospital before the end of the treatment , treatment is continued outside of the hospital .

University of Kentucky,NCT04364802,COVID-19: Povidone-Iodine Intranasal Prophylaxis in Front-line Healthcare Personnel and Inpatients,Nikita Gupta,2,1,COVID-19,Drug,Povidone-Iodine Nasal Spray and Gargle,Prevention,,"Povidone-iodine ( PVP-I ) is a broad-spectrum antiseptic with activity against bacteria , fungi , and viruses . It has been previously used in both intranasal preparations against Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus ( MRSA ) as well as oral preparations in in-vitro studies of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus ( SARS-CoV ) , Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus ( MERS-CoV ) , influenza H1N1 , and rotavirus with good efficacy . This study will evaluate the efficacy of PVP-I as prophylaxis in Coronavirus Disease 2019 ( COVID19 ) -negative front-line health care workers , hospital patients , and community members .","The COVID-19 pandemic , caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus - 2 ( SARS-CoV-2 ) , has been implicated in over 12 million cases and counting in the United States alone and has killed at least 1300 health care workers and > 250,000 citizens . This , added to the national shortage of personal protective equipment ( PPE ) and the need to reuse PPE , lends to the significantly increased risk to healthcare providers . At the beginning of this trial , there were only 360,000 cases . The highest concentration of viral particles resides within the nasopharynx . The virus is thought to spread via respiratory droplets with the potential for transmission via inhalation of droplets , contact to the nose and mouth with infected materials , and airborne transmission . Given that frontline workers are involved in high-risk procedures including intubation , bronchoscopy , proning patients ( which can lead to droplet production ) and in some cases are reusing PPE , finding ways to reduce viral load or viral exposure are paramount . Povidone-iodine ( PVP-I ) is a broad-spectrum antiseptic with activity against bacteria , fungi , and viruses . It has been previously used in both intranasal preparations against MRSA as well as oral preparations in in-vitro studies of SARS-CoV-2 , MERS-CoV , H1N1 , and rotavirus with good efficacy . Due to the known breadth of its antiviral activity and similarities in molecular structure , it can be extrapolated that PVP-I should have robust activity against SARS-CoV-2 . Eggers et al found that at a concentration of 1 % there was a reduction of viral activity of 99.99 % in in-vitro assays . At 2 minutes , a concentration of 0.23 % was enough to reduce viral loads appreciably . New data has demonstrated efficacy in-vitro of PVP-I against SARS-CoV-2 at low concentrations . PVP-I is widely used as an antiseptic and is well-tolerated and has been shown to have little to no effect on mucociliary clearance , olfaction , or thyroid function if iodine holidays are taken , although care must be utilized in monitoring . In this study , front line healthcare workers will be asked to complete a pre-participation survey and screened for COVID positivity . They will then be given premade PVP-I gargles and nasal sprays , as well as a calendar card to mark compliance . PVP-I nasal spray and gargle ( 10 % diluted 1:30 ) will be used prior to the start of a shift , during `` lunch break '' , and at the end of shift . First , the nasal spray will be sprayed in the nose ( 2 sprays each naris ) . For adequate coverage , the participant should be able to taste the iodine or see it in the back of the throat . This should be left in place for 30 seconds . Then , the participant will gargle the solution for 30 seconds and not have anything to eat or drink by mouth for 30 minutes . Treatment will continue for 3 weeks , or until the healthcare worker presents with COVID symptoms . Participants will then be tested for COVID positivity and asked to fill out a second questionnaire assessing study tolerability . At completion of the study , they will be asked to turn in their calendar card to assess how many applications they were able to complete . Given the high rate of asymptomatic carriers , a second arm will also be planned for patients who have a 7+ day hospitalization or who are set to undergo a significant surgical procedure . These patients will be offered participation in the study as well and will be given the same questionnaire and undergo preoperative testing if they consent . For patients in the study group , PVIP gargle and nasal sprays will be applied preoperatively or shortly after admission and enrollment in the study for the non-operative group . The patients will then be retested in 2 weeks or as directed by the presentation of symptoms concerning for infection with SARS-CoV-2 . Community spread has been found to be the most likely implicated in infection and thus the trial is now being expanded to include community members . Thus , a THIRD arm has now been added to include community members . Prescreening questionnaires will be given . As long as the participant has had no prior history of a positive COVID-19 test , they will be considered eligible for participation . After a screening consultation , they will undergo a COVID-19 test ( should be completed within 72 hours of screening ) . If negative , they will be eligible . Participants who are pregnant , breastfeeding , have thyroid disease or cancer , or who have an allergy to iodine/shellfish/or contrast dye can still participate but will automatically be on the control arm .

Ain Shams University,NCT04220281,Comparison Between Two Drugs (Propofol and Nitroglycerin as a Hypotensive Agents During Endoscopic Sinus Surgery,Ain Shams University,1,0,Hypotensive Anesthesia,Drug,Propofol,Other,Triple,"Background and Objectives : FESS is a common minimally invasive surgery that requires a clear field to be performed well . Hypotensive anesthesia is one of the most common maneuvers performed to help in keeping the field clear . An ideal drug for hypotensive anesthesia should be cheap and familial to the anesthesiologist . So being familial with propofol and by using its cardio-depressant action the idea of the research was developed and comparing it with nitroglycerin ( a hypotensive agent in our protocol ) . Methods : The patients agreed to participate in the research were classified into two groups for comparison . Propofol group ; received propofol infusion all over the procedure , and nitroglycerin group ; received nitroglycerin infusion all over the procedure . Duration of surgery , visibility of surgical field and amount of blood loss were recorded . Pulse/min and MAP were recorded at baseline and every 5 min . Results : The mean duration of surgery was longer in the NTG to propofol group . There was high statistical significance in the average blood loss in the propofol group compared to NTG group . The visibility of the operative field also was significant in the propofol group as compared to NTG group . The mean heart rate in the NTG group is higher than the mean heart rate in the propofol group . The MAP in both groups is within a close range . Conclusion : Propofol and NTG can produce a safe and effective controlled hypotension during FESS . Whereas , propofol has ; a better surgical field visibility , less surgical bleeding and less tachycardia during FESS .","INTRODUCTION FESS ( functional endoscopic sinus surgery ) is a popular minimally invasive surgical technique for management of patient with sinus pathological conditions . The aim of this sinus endoscopic surgery is to restore a normal mucociliary clearing function and drainage of sinuses . Although , it is a minimally invasive surgery but it can lead to a serious complications such as optic nerve injury , orbital cellulitis , meningitis , and rhino-oral fistulas . Bleeding is one of the obstacles that is associated with this technique that can decrease the surgical field visualization and increase the probability of complications . One of the most important maneuvers used to minimize this bleeding is hypotensive anesthesia . The ideal hypotensive agent for anesthetist must be a familiar drug , easy to use , rapid onset and offset and with minimal side effects . Nitroglycerin infusion is a frequently used drug to produce controlled hypotension , as it is cheap and easy to use drug rapid onset and offset time . But a common side effect is reflex tachycardia and venous congestion which may also obscures the surgical filed and decreases surgeon satisfaction . Total intravenous anesthesia ( TIVA ) using propofol and remifentanil is a common procedure used in western countries . In Egypt remifentanil is not freely available . So this study will be designed to use inhalational anesthesia and use propofol infusion as a hypotensive agent and to determine whether controlled hypotension , surgeon 's satisfaction and better operative filed can be achieved when compared to nitroglycerine infusion . AIM OF THE WORK The aim of the study is to identify the efficacy of propofol infusion as a hypotensive agent in comparison with nitroglycerin infusion during FESS . Study Design A total of 40 adult patients undergoing FESS procedure for sinusitis . Written informed consent will be obtained from all patients before randomization . Patients will be divided equally into two groups the first 20 patients will be assigned to propofol group ( Prop group ) and the other group to nitroglycerin group ( NTG group ) . Group assignment , preparation and administration of drugs will be performed by a junior anesthetist who is neither involved nor interested by any means in the study . The patients , the ENT surgeon , and the anesthetist collecting data all were blind to the groups . The anesthetist performing the general anesthesia was not blinded to the drug given but he was not one of the study participants .",2020-01-04,"February 12, 2020","Inclusion Criteria : Patients ASA I and II diagnosed for chronic sinusitis Age range between 18-60 years , undergoing elective FESS without septoplasty under general anesthesia .

We are presenting this urgent proposal to use the convalescent plasma to save the lives of severely affected COVID-19 patients . Most of the logistic support is already available in MOH Saudi Arabia , and it will be a cheap and quick technique based on the time-tested principles of passive immunization which is supported by the most recent data from China . We are proposing to test the therapeutic potential of convalescent plasma ( from patients who have fully recovered from COVID-19 ) in treating patients with serious COVID-19 disease or those who are at risk of developing a serious disease based on their comorbidities profile . Convalescent plasma could provide our first-line defense for people with Covid-19 , especially those who are older and at a much higher risk for complications . Amid the COVID-19 pandemic , with no available vaccine or proven antiviral drug , antibodies from recovering patients could provide a `` stopgap '' measure to help in controlling the pandemic effects on health and economy .

Clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 infection typically include respiratory symptoms , fever , cough , shortness of breath and breathing difficulties . In more severe cases , the infection can cause pneumonia , severe acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) , kidney failure and even death . It is not easy to differentiate between non-SARS-CoV-2 seasonal influenza and other respiratory viruses including the locally reported MERS-CoV and H1N1 influenza viruses . SARS-CoV-2 has a higher transmission rate ( TR ) with an approximate fatality rate of 3 % . Although most of the younger patients recover after milder disease , but COVID-19 is most aggressive in the elderly population with worst pneumonia and death rates may reach 14.8 % .4 Final diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection depends on viral detection ( and if possible , exclusion of other viruses e.g . by Respiratory Viral Panel ) . Laboratory detection of the SARS-CoV2 is based on detection of viral RNA by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( rRT-PCR ) with confirmation by nucleic acid sequencing when necessary.1-5 For example , GeneFinder™ COVID-19 Plus RealAmp Kit is the One-Step Reverse Transcription Real-Time PCR Kit designed to detect the Novel Coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) qualitatively through Reverse Transcription reaction and Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction . We will use this or equivalent method to confirm the diagnosis and will repeat the rRT-PCR to make sure it has become negative in a recovered patient . As of now , no vaccine or antiviral drug coming soon , antibodies from recovering patients could provide a `` stop-gap '' measure to help in controlling the pandemic . The concept of using convalescent plasma is not new . It has been tried in limited numbers of patients during more-recent viral crises , including the 2003 SARS ( severe acute respiratory syndrome ) epidemic , the 2009 `` swine flu '' epidemic , and the 2012 outbreak of MERS ( Middle East respiratory syndrome ) .6 Convalescent plasma treatment reduced mortality in patients with severe pandemic influenza A ( H1N1 ) 2009 Virus Infection.7 Patients with a resolved viral infection will develop a polyclonal antibody immune response to different viral antigens of 2019-nCoV . Some of these polyclonal antibodies will likely neutralize the virus and prevent new rounds of infection , and the patients with resolved infection should produce 2019-nCoV antibodies in high titer . Patients with resolved cases of 2019-nCoV can simply donate plasma , and then this plasma can be transfused into infected patients.8 Given that plasma donation is well established , and the transfusion of plasma is also routine medical care , this proposal does not need any new science or medical approvals in order to be put into place . Indeed , the same rationale was used in the treatment of several Ebola patients with convalescent serum during the outbreak in 2014-2015.9 Since the emergence of this SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan , China , in December 2019 , it has rapidly spread across China and more than 188 other countries and territories . According to the WHO , as of March 27 , 2020 , there have been 540,832 confirmed cases worldwide and 24,294 deaths . SARS-CoV-2 has structural similarity to SARS-CoV that caused SARS and MERS-CoV.3 In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia , there are 1012 confirmed cases reported till now , with 3 deaths ( on March 26 , 2020 ) . The Saudi government 's prompt actions to slow down the spread of SARS-CoV-2 seem to be effective . However , CDC Estimates 40-70 % of the US population will be infected with SARS-CoV-2 . Even with curtailment measures , judging from past pandemics , approximately 40 % of human beings will be exposed to COVID-19 over the next 2-3 years . Most of these infected people will recover and almost all of them will be immune . Vigilance and readiness are needed to teach the masses about preventive measures because older people and those with comorbidities will be the sickest . Contemporaneously , therapeutic measures are highly needed from the medical community to treat COVID-19 patients .",2020-04-08,"November 14, 2021","Inclusion Criteria : s Recipients : We will use the confirmed case definition of SARS-CoV-2 infection ( COVID-19 ) with POSITIVE rRT PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 `` using one of the SFDA approved kit used in KSA '' as per current MOH / SCDPC ( Waqayah ) guidelines ( derived from WHO and CDC ) . 18 or older Patient with COVID 19 confirmed as per case definition of CDC or MOH/Waqayah Must have been requiring ICU care or severe or immediately life-threatening care : i .

Centre Chirurgical Marie Lannelongue,NCT04347980,Dexamethasone Treatment for Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Induced by COVID-19,Centre Chirurgical Marie Lannelongue,3,0,"Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Adult",Drug,Dexamethasone and Hydroxychloroquine,Treatment,Single,Single blind randomized clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy of the combination of hydroxychloroquine and dexamethasone as treatment for severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ( ARDS ) related to coronavirus disease 19 ( COVID-19 ) . We hypothesize that dexamethasone ( 20 mg for 5 days followed by 10 mg for 5 days ) combined with 600 mg per day dose of hydroxychloroquine for 10 days will reduce the 28-day mortality compared to hydroxychloroquine alone in patients with severe ARDS related COVID-19 .,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic causing COVID-19 disease affects hundreds of thousands of patients . Of these , 5 % will present with acute respiratory failure , the most severe form of which is Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ( ARDS ) . Hospital mortality affects 45 % of patients with severe ARDS . The improvement in mortality associated with ARDS seems largely explained by the reduction in lesions induced by mechanical ventilation , in particular a tidal volume ( Vt ) set at 6 ml / kg of the weight predicted by the size associated with a plateau pressure must not exceed 30 cm of water . Unfortunately and despite the application of these recommendations , ARDS related COVID-19 is associated with a mortality of 65 % . About 42 % of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonitis will develop ARDS and the onset of ARDS is rapid after admission with a median of 2 days . Interestingly , a study reported that patients suffering from ARDS and having received corticosteroids had a mortality rate of 46 % ( 23 out of 50 ) compared to 61.8 % ( 21 out of 34 ) in patients who did not receive corticosteroids . However , this difference was not significant ( P = 0.15 ) . The survival curve showed , however , that the administration of corticosteroids ( Methylprednisolone ) reduced the risk of death ( Hazard ratio : 0.38 ( 95 % confidence interval 0.20-0.72 ) ; P = 0.003 ) . The authors concluded that a randomized study was necessary to confirm this impression . The theoretical justification for treatment with corticosteroids is related to the recognition of the inflammatory syndrome as a factor in the development of an uncontrolled and harmful fibroproliferative phase . It seems certain that late administration ( beyond the 14th day after the start of ARDS ) is deleterious in patients by increasing mortality . However , a recent study shows that early administration of dexamethasone ( within 30 hours after the start of ARDS ) is associated with an increase of ventilator-free days and a decrease in mortality at 2 months . In COVID-19 disease , there is also a cytokine storm and an intense inflammatory reaction . Currently the use of corticosteroids is not recommended during a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection . Administration of corticosteroids may delay elimination of the virus . Recently , a preliminary study reported that the administration of hydroxychloroquine ( 200mg x3 per day ) decreased or even made disappear the viral load . This clinical study appears to corroborate an experimental study . However , hydroxychloroquine can have cardiac toxicity which , although rare , can be serious . In summary : The appearance of an ARDS during a COVID-19 is burdened with a mortality of 65 % The viral load has decreased when ARDS is present The use of hydroxychloroquine makes it possible to significantly reduce the viral load Early administration of corticosteroids seems beneficial in ARDS",2020-04-09,"August 6, 2021","Inclusion Criteria : Patient over 18 years old Patient affiliated to a health insurance plan Patient who has given their free , informed and written consent or patient for whom an independent doctor has given their signed consent as part of an emergency procedure Kaliemia > 3,5 mmol / L Patient diagnosed COVID-19 positive by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) and / or CT The diagnosis of COVID-19 will be made if : Patient with radiological images strongly suggestive of a chest scan associated with respiratory symptoms , without other obvious etiologies OR Patient with suggestive respiratory symptoms associated with a positive RT-PCR Patients admitted to intensive care with acute respiratory distress syndrome secondary to COVID-19 , intubated for less than 5 days with : Either - Hypoxemia defined by a arterial partial pressure of oxygen / fraction of inspiratory oxygen ratio ( PaO2 / FiO2 ) ratio < 100 after 2 sessions of prone position Either - An alteration in pulmonary compliance ( tidal volume divided by plateau pressure minus positive expiratory pressure ) immediately or over the first 96 hours after the start of ARDS defined by : immediately : impossibility of maintaining a plateau pressure 20 mg / day ) or Hydroxychloroquine Immunocompromised patients : AIDS , bone marrow or solid organ transplant recipients Pregnant women Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase ( G6PD ) deficiency",5,0,18 Years,80 Years
University of Leicester,NCT04219124,"The Effect of a SGLT2 Inhibitor on Glucose Flux, Lipolysis and Exercise in Type 2 Diabetes",University of Leicester,4,1,Type 2 Diabetes,Drug,IMP oral tablet,Other,Double,"The study is a randomised double blind placebo control cross over trial with 4 weeks washout period . The expected duration of participant participation is 103 days . the study aims to investigate the effect of dapagliflozin , a SGLT2 inhibitor , on glucose flux , lipolysis and exercise in patients with type 2 diabetes .","SGLT2 inhibitors are a new class of drug that have a novel mechanism of action by promoting urinary glucose excretion to lower blood glucose levels . The recent observations that ketogenesis or episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis seem to be of higher frequency in patients with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes on SGLT2 inhibitors , is of considerable worldwide interest . SGLT2 inhibitors seem to be associated with euglycemic DKA and ketosis , perhaps because of their noninsulin-dependent glucose clearance , hyperglucagonemia , and volume depletion . There have been two papers that have looked at this in some detail . One is a metabolic study by Ferrannini et al and a review paper by Yabe et al . The central question that needs to be raised is whether the observed effects are solely due to the SGLT2 inhibitors masking elevations in blood glucose in insulin deficient states , or whether there is some metabolic effect of the SGLT2 inhibitors that make episodes more likely to occur . There is increasing evidence to suggest that the SGLT2 inhibitors are affecting metabolism in several ways and that these may contribute to the risk of ketoacidosis . Ferrannini et al have shown that , on chronic usage , lipid oxidation rates change and thus the body appears to have a homeostatic response to losing glucose by switching metabolism more in favour of free fatty acids . It is also possible that protein and other metabolites are also involved in this process but these have never been studied . Recent trials of newer glucose-lowering agents have been neutral on the primary Cardiovascular ( CV ) outcome . However , patients with type 2 diabetes at high risk for cardiovascular events who received empagliflozin , as compared with placebo , had a lower rate of the primary composite cardiovascular outcome and of death from any cause when the study drug was added to standard care . This may be a class effect and is of high importance to explore the effects of SGLT2 inhibitor effect on cardiovascular function . Aim : To study the metabolic adaptions that take place following chronic administration of SGLT2 inhibitors in people with Type 2 diabetes and to establish whether these adaptations contribute to the development of ketoacidosis . Study procedure : The recruitment phase will commence as soon as there is ethical , HRA , research governance and regulatory approval and only after the Sponsor 'green light ' has been issued . Recruitment : From Diabetes Clinics at Cedar centre , Royal Surrey County Hospital and additional locations : local GP practices , other healthcare settings including but not limited to outpatient clinics , retinal screening , podiatry , diabetes patient groups , University of Surrey staff . Participants will be screened by the diabetes research team , which includes research doctors and nurses working at the Cedar centre research unit . Informed Consent- The participant will have a minimum of 24hours to consider participation in the study to consider the information , and the opportunity to question the Investigator , their GP or other independent parties to decide whether to participate in the study . Written Informed Consent will then be obtained . If the individual fulfils the inclusion criteria and meets none of the exclusion criteria they will be accepted into the study . All females of childbearing age will need to provide a urine sample for a pregnancy test . Diastolic blood pressure , systolic blood pressure , and pulse will be taken in line with the Cedar centre SOP . Any abnormal or clinically significant deterioration will be reported as an adverse event . Weight and height will be recorded at screening visit and weight only at visits 2- 6 . Weight ( without shoes ) will be measured using body composition analyser . Height ( without shoes ) recorded using a stand-alone stadiometer for height measurement , manufacturer unknown . Body Mass Index ( BMI ) will be calculated and rounded up/down to nearest whole figure at each visit . Physical examination will be carried out . Any abnormal , clinically significant findings at screening visit must be recorded as concomitant illness . If acute kidney injury occurs , the study medication will be promptly discontinued and kidney impairment treated using standard guidelines . Laboratory Tests Point of care or plasma HbA1C within 1 month of the screening visit . All laboratory results will be reviewed , and the reports signed by the Investigator or delegate in accordance with the delegation log , who will record in the CRF whether they are normal , abnormal but not clinically significant , or abnormal and clinically significant . In the latter case the eligibility of the participants will be reviewed . Bloods samples analysed at University of Surrey will be viewed as bloods of research significance and not reported to the GP . Subsequent Assessments : Visit 2 : week 1 : Baseline VO2 max test A VO2 max test will be used to tailor exercise intensity to each participant . This exercise intensity information will be used for visit 3 and 5 when the exercise test is completed . Participants will use an exercise bike and wear a mask and mouthpiece . Participants will perform a 5min warm up at 25 % VO2 max . The submaximal exercise test using a 2-stage bicycle ergometer protocol will consist of two consecutive 10min stages at a constant load corresponding to 40 and 70 % VO2 max followed by 5 min warm down . In addition , measurements relating to heart function will be taken . Visit 3 and 5 : Exercise test Participants will have a standardised meal the evening before the exercise test and will arrive at the laboratory after an overnight fast . The standardised meal is 500-kcal meal , which will be provided by the study team for the participant to prepare and cook at home . A cannula will be inserted into an antecubital vein and baseline blood samples taken at times 0 , 5 , 10 , 15 , 20 , 25 , 30 and 60 min before , during and after exercise . Participants will be asked to complete a set duration of exercise on the exercise bike . The duration and intensity will have been calculated from the results of visit 2 . They will wear a mouthpiece and mask throughout and be attached to a cardiac monitor . The following measurements will be taken before and during/after exercise : Plasma non-esterified fatty acid concentrations , atrial natriuretic peptide , noradrenaline and adrenaline ( n=8 for each measurement ) Plasma glucose , insulin and growth hormone concentrations ( n=8 for each measurement ) Ketone body and metabolite concentrations ( n=8 for each measurement ) ECG trace BP , HR and Rate Pressure Product ( RPP=HR * SBP ) Calculated substrate oxidation recorded as VO2 ml/min and VCO2 ml/min and resting energy requirement ( RER ) Capillary lactate concentration Visit 4 and 6 : The Metabolic Assessment Day ( 8-10 hours ) Participants will have taken the randomised study treatment daily for 28 days prior to visit 4 and 6 . Blood glucose study diaries will be collected at visit 4 and 6 . Hypoglycaemia events will be reviewed . Data from their home glucose monitoring will not be collected for further analysis . Participants should refrain from alcohol and strenuous exercise for 24hours prior to any metabolic assessment day . If female of childbearing age , a urine pregnancy test will be undertaken prior to the commencement of any metabolic study activity . Blood pressure and heart rate will be recorded . Participants will be asked to return their unused IMP at visit 4 and visit 6 . They will be prescribed the IMP required for the second arm of the study depending on the randomisation code . Participants will have a standardised meal the evening before the metabolic assessment day and will attend the clinical research unit at 7.00am on the morning of the assessment day after an overnight fast . Blood glucose concentration will be measured using a glucose oxidase technique on a glucose analyser ( YSI 2300 Clandon Scientific , Yellow Springs Instruments , Yellow Springs , Ohio , USA ) . Hydration may be maintained by insertion of an intravenous fluid drip . All blood samples will be separated immediately using a centrifuge ( Heraeus Labofuge 400 centrifuge , Thermo Fisher Scientific . UK ) and the plasma stored at -20°c at the Cedar centre overnight and then transferred to a minus -80°c freezer at the University of Surrey for analysis later at the University of Surrey . Metabolic Assessment Day Blood samples will be as shown in Appendix A . The samples will be used for measuring different metabolites and hormones at various time points . Intravenous cannulae will be inserted into the antecubital fossa of each arm : one for blood taking at time -15 minutes and the other for the infusion of the isotopes [ 6,6 ] - 2H2 glucose and [ 1,1,2,3,3 ] - 2H5 glycerol at time 360 minutes . Two fasting samples will be taken at -10 and 0 for the baseline isotope enrichment for glucose , glycerol and palmitate and NEFA and ketone body concentrations and various hormone concentrations . At 0 minutes the study medication will be taken and a stable isotope of U-13C palmitate ( 200mg ) in 30 ml olive oil will be ingested in less than 2 minutes after which blood samples will be taken for palmitate enrichment and concentration in TAG and NEFA pools and TAG and NEFA concentrations . A primed infusion of stable isotope of glucose and glycerol will be given from 360 to 480 minutes and the concentration and enrichment of both glucose and glycerol will be measured from 450 minutes to 480 minutes . Samples will be taken for glucose concentration throughout the study . Blood samples for acetoacetate concentration and beta-hydroxybutyrate enrichment and concentration will be taken . One blood sample will be taken at 480 minutes for targeted metabolomics and cardiac biomarkers . Blood samples for will also be taken for insulin , glucagon and cortisol . Patients will be asked to empty their bladder and urine will be collected to analyse glucose excretion at 120 , 360 , 450 and 480 minutes ( 4 samples ) . A Transthoracic Echocardiogram and pulse wave velocity will be completed during the metabolic assessment day . This can be done at any time point during the metabolic assessment day . On completion of the metabolic assessment day , participants will be reminded that they have the telephone number for the research team that can be used 24hours a day ( identification card ) and will be advised not to drive home . There will be a minimum period of a 28-day drug wash out period before starting the second arm of the study . The participant will be dispensed with trial medication for the second arm at visit 4 . A date will be agreed for visit 5 and 6 to allow the study doctor to advise when the participant should to start taking the study medication in preparation for visit 5 and 6 . Telephone Visits 1 and 2 The research team will contact the participant the day after each metabolic assessment day to ensure glucose levels have normalised . This may be a Saturday if a metabolic study is conducted on a Friday . Telephone Visit 3 Once participants have completed both metabolic assessments days the participant will have completed the research study protocol . Each participant will receive a follow up check on well-being 2-4 weeks after completion of the last metabolic assessment day and will continue their diabetes care with their usual diabetes doctor . If a participant withdraws from the study , all samples will be destroyed but the anonymised data collected up to the point of withdrawal will be used unless explicitly stated by the participant . The study doctor may also decide that it is no longer appropriate for a participant to continue with the study . This will happen if they no longer meet the requirements for the study or exclusion criteria become apparent . The participant will be required to withdraw from the study if they become pregnant or lose capacity to follow the study procedures and provide consent to continue .",2020-01-02,"April 26, 2021","Inclusion Criteria : • Able in the opinion of the investigator , and willing to give informed consent obtained before any study-related activities .

The aim of this study is to test the effect of Tocilizumab on multi-organ dysfunction in a phase 3 randomized controlled trial among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection . Specifically , as compared to placebo , we will test whether tocilizumab is associated with a reduction in multi-organ dysfunction among hospitalized COVID-19 adult patients with elevated inflammatory measures . Multi-organ dysfunction will be measured as the incidence of the following composite endpoint ( mechanical ventilation , renal replacement therapy , mechanical support , need for inotropes or vasopressors , liver dysfunction ( increased bilirubin ) , and all-cause mortality ) . We will also assess multiple pre-specified secondary ( exploratory ) endpoints and safety endpoints . We hypothesize that , as compared to placebo , tocilizumab will reduce transfer to the ICU , need for mechanical ventilation , increase rates of hospital discharge in patients diagnosed with severe COVID-19 infection and evidence of exaggerated inflammatory response .","As of April 3 , 2020 , COVID-19 has been confirmed in over 1 million people worldwide , with an estimated symptomatic case fatality ratio of around 1.4 % . Currently without an effective treatment for SARS-CoV-2 there is an urgent need for effective treatment to curtail the rate of respiratory failure , the leading cause of mortality in COVID-19 disease . Moreover , with increasing numbers of patients requiring intensive unit level care and mechanical ventilation , nations are already having to triage patients for ventilatory support due to limited resources and healthcare systems around the world being stretched to the point of collapse , highlighting the importance of identifying interventions that could prevent the development of respiratory failure for these patients . The disease course of COVID-19 includes an incubation period , an acute viral phase that most commonly presents with flu-like symptoms that in some individuals progresses to a severe hyperinflammatory phase marked by acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) and hypoxemic respiratory failure.Though there is spectrum of clinical course , many progress to the hyperinflammatory phase around day seven of symptoms , often requiring intensive care unit ( ICU ) level care and mechanical ventilation . Accumulating evidence suggests that the pathophysiology underlying this profound decline is a severe inflammatory response as demonstrated by multi organ system dysfunction akin to cytokine release syndrome ( CRS ) /macrophage activation syndrome ( MAS ) .CRS/MAS is a systemic hyperinflammatory syndrome on a spectrum with secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis ( sHLH ) , typically characterized by multiorgan failure that is often triggered by viral infections in the setting of excessive immune activation , typically with marked hyperferritinemia.Postmortem assessment of patients with COVID-19 have demonstrated pathologic findings consistent with MAS such as mono/lymphocytic infiltrates within the lung parenchyma with associated edema and alveolar congestion , splenic necrosis with macrophage proliferation and hemophagocytosis , as well as a lymphocyte/histiocyte predominate infiltrate of portal vasculature accompanying liver necrosis and sinusoidal congestion.Cytokine profiling of patients with MAS/sHLH overlaps with that seen in patients with severe COVID-19 and includes elevated levels of IL-1 , IL-2 , IL-7 , IL-6 , G-CSF , MCP- 1 , and TNF-α as well as elevated D-dimer , C-reactive protein , LDH and troponins.Moreover , preliminary data from a non-randomized series of COVID-19 patients with `` severe or critical COVID-19 '' from China who were treated with tocilizumab ( in addition to standard therapies ) showed they had dramatic improvement in fever , arterial oxygen saturation and inflammatory markers within the first 24-hours following administration . Taken together , these data strongly suggest an immunologic link between COVID-19 and immune dysregulation resulting in MAS . Clinical trials are already underway studying the role of immunomodulatory therapy including modulation of IL-1 and IL-6 and downstream pathways in the setting of CAR-T induced MAS ( NCT04150913 , NCT04071366 ) and agents such anakinra and tocilizumab have been used in this context with promising results and good safety profiles . There is an urgent and dire need to study the therapeutic role for immunomodulatory therapy in COVID-19 disease to both halt disease progression in patients at an individual level and prevent the inevitable saturation of healthcare resources at a systems level , to which end there are numerous ongoing international trials to expand these efforts into the setting of COVID-19 infection ( ChiCTR2000029765 , NCT04324021 , TOCOVID-19 ) . Based on the MGH experience thus far with COVID-19 , including over 200 patients to date , the need for mechanical ventilation has been approximately 30 % . With the upcoming surge anticipated between April 17th and 21st we expect the need for hundreds of additional ICU beds . Investigators propose a trial of IL-6 receptor blockade with tocilizumab given early in disease course to try to prevent progression of COVID-19 .",2020-04-19,"July 23, 2021","Inclusion criteria : Subjects who meet all of the following criteria will be eligible to participate in the study : Must have provided informed consent in a manner approved by the Investigator 's Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) or Independent Ethics Committee ( IEC ) prior to any assessments .

Written informed consent was obtained after the nature of the study had been fully explained to the patient . Recruitment took place from October 2018 to October 2019 . The study received the local Institutional Review Board approval and all procedures are in accordance with the ethical standards as stated in the Helsinki Declaration . A total of 59 patients were recruited for the study . Subjects were randomised into three groups : control ( n=19 ) , card only ( n=20 ) , card and tele-reminder ( n=20 ) with an allocation ratio of 1:1:1 . ( Figure 1 ) . Sample size was calculated based on similar drug adherence studies powered to detect a true difference in adherence rates with power at 80 % and alpha at 5 % - 20 patients per group were required . The personalised card was printed by the attending ophthalmologist for the patient via a web accessible software we have developed . The software allowed the reviewing physician to select the medications the patient was prescribed and auto-generate a personalised card that will be sent to the network printer . The card illustrated the patient 's eye drop regime in a simple pictorial format using coloured pictures of the eye drop bottles and universally recognised symbols . It can be folded to a compact size of 11cm x 7.5cm to allow patients to carry around in their wallets . This card will be given to patients at the end of their consult and explanation will be provided by the attending physician who will manually tick in the corresponding boxes depending on the frequency of administration . Patients who were recruited into the group receiving tele-monitoring were contacted via text messages daily by a programmed software at the scheduled time of eye drop administration . They were required to acknowledge the reminder by replying a 'Yes ' if they had administered the eyedrop and 'No ' if they had not . A nil reply was taken as a 'No ' . Trained research assistants and a medical student administered the pre-implementation baseline adherence questionnaire in-person after informed consent was obtained . The questionnaire included questions on ( i ) demographics ( ii ) barriers to adherence and ( iii ) Morisky adherence scale . The demographic information included age , gender , length of time using glaucoma medications , number of glaucoma medications , educational level , whether they identify the medications by name or colour and who helps with the eye drop instillation . In the second section on barriers to adherence , participants were asked to use a visual analogue scale to rate the importance of 11 commonly cited reasons that make it `` hard for patients to take glaucoma eye drops .

Parc de Salut Mar,NCT04316598,Cannabis Effects on Electroencephalography,Parc de Salut Mar,1,0,Healthy Volunteers,Drug,Cannabis Sativa,Other,Triple,"Background : Tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC ) is a partial CB1/CB2 agonist and causes its pharmacological effects by binding to cannabinoid receptors . CB1 receptors are predominantly located in the brain ( highest densities at hippocampus , cerebellum and the striatum ) and at low levels in the brainstem . CB2 receptors are predominantly in the spleen and in hematopoietic cells . THC is highly lipophilic and is readily absorbed and distributed to the brain and other organs . Most of the neuropsychological studies carried out so far show that the mainly affected neurocognitive functions in cannabis users are : memory , attention , psychomotor capacity , speed of information processing and alterations of executive functions ( resistance to interference , planning capacity , decision-making , verbal fluency and working memory ) . These effects are dose-dependent . Hypothesis : Functional CB1 receptor activation by the THC contained in the cannabis flos will induce dose-dependent effects on EEG , physiological functions and behavior : EEG alterations . Increase in cannabis subjective effects . Increase in heart rate . Increase in psychopathology scale Psychotomimetic State Inventory ( PSI ) score . Increase in plasma cortisol concentrations . Objectives : Main pharmacodynamic objective : To assess the effects of Cannabis flos on electroencephalography ( EEG ) in healthy recreational cannabis users . Secondary pharmacodynamic objectives : ( i ) To assess the effects of Cannabis flos on : cannabis subjective effects , heart rate and psychopathology scale ; ( ii ) To establish the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationships between THC plasma concentrations and pharmacodynamic endpoints . Safety and tolerability objectives : To assess the safety and tolerability of THC in these subjects . Methods : Phase I , prospective , monocentric , double-blind , randomized , placebo-controlled , parallel group study to assess the THC effects on EEG neural oscillations in 16 healthy subjects with recreational cannabis use .","Subjects will be randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to either Arm A ( Cannabis ) or Arm B ( Cannabis placebo ) . The subjects , Investigators and designees involved in the conduct of the study will be blinded to the identity of the treatment administered during the study . In the active group ( Arm A ) subjects will be administered four single doses of 20 mg THC over 3 days , equivalent to 285.7 μg/kg . This dose is considered to be sufficient for eliciting the psychoactive effects of THC ( > 5 ng/mL in plasma ) and modify EEG , avoiding subjects to be too much behaviorally impaired . THC will be administered in the form of medical cannabis ( Bedrocan® ) inhaled by intrapulmonary route . It is featured in flos form ( Cannabis sativa dried female flower ) containing THC 22 % and cannabidiol ( CBD ) < 1 % . A vaporization system ( Mighty® Medic device ) will be used for cannabis administration . Through this system , the final inhalation of THC is comparable to that of smoking cannabis while reducing the inhalation of toxic and irritating substances generated in the combustion of herbs .",2020-03-18,"July 29, 2020","Inclusion Criteria : Healthy male or female subjects .

Complete response will be defined as histological disappearance of malignancy on bladder biopsy and resolution of abnormal cytological findings after treatment . Time to first recurrence , time to progression , overall survival , and disease-specific survival wil be estimated by use of the Kaplan-Meier method .","Partecipants Inclusion criteria : Patients with urothelial high risk NMIBC ( high grade stage Ta , T1 and/or carcinoma in situ ) after intravesical BCG failure ; adequate bone marrow reserve ; normal renal function ; normal liver function ; Karnofsky performance score of 50 to 100 . Exclusion criteria : non-urothelial carcinomas of the bladder ; known allergy to MMC ; previous or concomitant urothelial carcinoma of the upper urinary tract and urethra , or both ; bladder capacity less than 200 mL ; untreated urinary-tract infection ; severe systemic infection ( ie , sepsis ) ; urethral strictures that would prevent endoscopic procedures and catheterisation ; other concurrent chemotherapy , radiotherapy , and treatment with biological response modifiers ; other malignant diseases within 5 years of start of EMDA MMC ( except for adequately treated basal-cell or squamous-cell skin cancer , in situ cervical cancer ) ; pregnancy ; psychological , familial , sociological , or geographical factors that would preclude study participation . The institutional review boards of each participating centre approved the study design . all enrolled patients will sign an informed consent form , approved by the institutional review boards , providing details of treatments . BCG Failure The definition of BCG failure in patients has been proposed as follows : BCG-refractory disease when there is failure to achieve a disease-free state at 6 months following initial BCG therapy with either maintenance or retreatment at 3 months because of persistent or rapidly recurrent tumor ; BCG-resistant disease when there is recurrence or persistence at 3 months following an induction cycle ; BCG-relapsing disease when the disease recurs after the patient is disease-free for 6 months ; BCG-intolerant disease when the disease recurs following administration of a less than adequate course of therapy because of a serious adverse event or symptomatic intolerance that requires discontinuation of further BCG therapy.13 Study design Patients will underwent : upper urinary tract imaging , urinary cytology of the bladder and upper urinary tract ; random cold-cup biopsies of the bladder and prostatic urethra-ie , sampling of seemingly healthy urothelium and of suspicious areas ; and complete transurethral resection ( TUR ) of all bladder tumour visible on endoscopy , ensuring muscle was included in resected samples . All patients will underwent re-staging TUR 4-5 weeks later . All clinical assessors are adequately trained in the above procedures , and no methods are used to enhance the quality of measurements . All biopsy samples of tumour and bladder will be reviewed by a pathologist for stage and grade . Tumour stage are classified according to the 1997 TNM classification of the International Union Against Cancer , and tumour grade was defined in accordance with the 1973 WHO classification . Treatment schedule All patients will start induction EMDA/MMC of 6 intravesical treatments at weekly intervals commencing 2-3 weeks after re-staging TUR . Intravesical EMDA MMC is given by a battery-powered generator delivering a controlled electric current that passes between the active intravesical electrode integrated into a specific transurethral catheter and dispersive ground electrodes on skin of the lower abdomen ( Physion srl , Mirandola , Italy ) . Patients are placed on fluid restriction and 2 g ingested sodium bicarbonate the night before treatment , the morning of treatment , and 2 h before treatment with mitomycin . The bladder is emptied through the electrode-transurethral-catheter and 40 mg mitomycin dissolved in 100 mL water was infused intravesically by gravity and retained in the bladder for 30 min , while 20 mA for 30 min pulsed electric current was given externally . Two dispersive cathode electrodes were placed on lower abdominal skin that had been degreased with alcohol . The bladder was then emptied and the catheter removed . Patients who were disease-free 3 months after treatment were scheduled to receive monthly infusions of BCG for 10 months . Maintenance treatment was given to the same dose and methods of infusion as initial allocated treatment . Response to treatment was assessed with abdominal ultrasonography , cystoscopy , and urinary cytology . In patients who were free of disease 3 months after treatment , these assessments were done every 3 months during the first 3 years and every 6 months thereafter . Patients with carcinoma in situ underwent abdominal ultrasonography , cystoscopy , urinary cytology , and random bladder biopsies at 3 months and 6 months . If bladder cytology was positive for cancer cells but no lesions were visible on cystoscopy , cytology of the upper urinary tract and random biopsies of the bladder and prostatic urethra were done . If , at 3 months ' follow-up , carcinoma in situ persisted or a superficial tumour recurred ( ie , stage pTa tumour confined to the urothelium or stage pT1 with invasion of the lamina propria ) , the patient underwent multiple , random biopsy sampling and TUR of all bladder tumour visible on endoscopy and received a second course of intervention treatment . Cystoscopy , biopsies , and urinary cytology were repeated 3 months after the start of the second course . Patients who were disease-free after the second course of treatment received the full course of monthly maintenance instillations ( ie , one infusion of electromotive mitomycin for 10 ) . Patients were suspended from the trial on a second recurrence , on persistence of carcinoma in situ , on development of carcinoma in the upper-urinary tract or prostatic urethra , on progression to muscle-invasive disease ( ie , stage pT2 or more advanced ) , or on development of metastases . Further treatment was left to the discretion of the local investigator . Toxicity Side effects were classified as local , systemic or allergic . Local toxicity was defined as culture proven bacterial cystitis , drug induced ( chemical ) cystitis and other localized effects . Systemic side effects were defined as fever exceeding 38C , general malaise and fatigue . Skin rash was regarded as allergic reaction . The severity of side effects were classified by the treating physician , with subsequent decision to continue , delay or abandon treatment . Patient follow-up . Response to treatment was assessed with cystoscopy , urinary cytology and /or biopsy only if indicated by suspicious cytological findings or on cystoscopy . In disease-free cases , cystoscopy and urinary cytology were repeated at 3-month intervals for 2 years , 6-month intervals for 3 years and yearly thereafter . Patient evaluation Patients with stage pTa and pT1 tumour without carcinoma in situ are classified as disease-free and therefore treated prophylactically ; those with carcinoma in situ are treated therapeutically , and response is scored as no response or as complete response . Complete response is defined as complete disappearance of carcinoma in situ , as documented by a normal cytology , cystoscopy , and random bladder biopsies . The primary endpoint is disease-free interval for patients without carcinoma in situ and for patients with carcinoma in situ who are disease-free after treatment-ie , time from enrollment to first cystoscopy noting recurrence . Patients with carcinoma in situ who did not have complete response after 3 months of treatment are regarded as having recurrence with no follow-up . The secondary endpoints are time to progression , overall survival , and disease specific survival . Time to progression is defined as time from randomisation until the onset of muscle invasive disease as recorded by pathological assessment of TUR samples or biopsy samples . Overall survival is defined as time from enrollment until death from any cause ; disease specific survival as time from enrollment until death from bladder cancer . Patients without recurrence or progression are censored at the last cystoscopy , and those lost to follow-up were censored at the last known day of survival . Statistical Analysis All analyses are done by intention to treat . Time to first recurrence , time to progression , overall survival , and disease-specific survival are estimated by use of the Kaplan-Meier method . Comparisons are estimated by use of log-rank test . All tests are two-sided , and p < 0·05 was regarded as significant . The investigators will calculated hazard ratios with 95 % CI by use of proportional-hazards regression .",2020-03-10,"June 20, 2023","Inclusion Criteria : Patients with urothelial high risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer ( high grade stage Ta , T1 and/or carcinoma in situ ) after intravesical BCG failure ; adequate bone marrow reserve ; normal renal function ; normal liver function ; Karnofsky performance score of 50 to 100 ; Exclusion Criteria : Non-urothelial carcinomas of the bladder ; known allergy to mitomicyn ; previous or concomitant urothelial carcinoma of the upper urinary tract and urethra , or both ; bladder capacity less than 200 mL ; untreated urinary-tract infection ; severe systemic infection ( ie , sepsis ) ; urethral strictures that would prevent endoscopic procedures and catheterisation ; other concurrent chemotherapy , radiotherapy , and treatment with biological response modifiers ; other malignant diseases within 5 years of start of EMDA MMC ( except for adequately treated basal-cell or squamous-cell skin cancer , in situ cervical cancer ) ; pregnancy ; psychological , familial , sociological , or geographical factors that would preclude study participation .",52,0,18 Years,90 Years

Group ( SP ) : 25 ml of bupivacaine 0.5 % for us guided supraclavicular block plus10 ml of lidocaine 2 % for us guided PECll block . Study Procedures : Following local university ethical committee approval , informed consent will be obtained . Details of the anesthetic technique and the study protocol will be fully explained at the preoperative visit , and written consent will be obtained from each patient before inclusion in the study . The patients has to have normal prothrombin ( PT ) and partial thromboplastin ( PTT ) times before the procedure . In the pre-induction room the patients will be taught how to assess their own pain score using the numerical rating scale ( NRS ) ( 0-10 ; 0 = no pain , 10 = worst imaginable pain ) . On arrival at the operating room , standard monitoring will be established with five lead electrocardiogram , non-invasive blood pressure measurement and pulse oximeter . After insertion of a 20-gauge intravenous cannula in the non operated arm , an intravenous crystalloid solution will be administered . Supplemental oxygen will be supplied through nasal cannula . The oxygen flow will be set at 3 L/ min . Patients will receive 1-2 md midazolam intravenous as premedication before the block . All blocks will be performed by one of the authors , The patients will be randomly allocated to one of the two groups , either supraclavicular-intercostobrachial group ( SI Group ) , or the supraclavicular-Pec 11 group ( SP Group ) . The patient in SI Group is placed in a semi-sitting position by elevating the head of bed 45 degrees with the patients head turned to the opposite site to be blocked . The skin of the neck and the upper chest and axilla and medial upper arm will be prepared in an aseptic fashion . Ultrasound examination of the supraclavicular area will be performed using a 38-mm high frequency ( 9-12 MHz ) linear array transducer with the in-plane approach , will receive 25 ml of 0.5 % bupivacaine in the supraclavicular area , then the operated arm will be abducted and externally rotated , and the elbow flexed to 90° . Ultrasound examination of the medial upper arm will be performed using a 38-mm high frequency ( 9-12 MHz ) linear array transducer and the intercosto-brachial nerve is identified and blocked using 10 ml of lidocaine 2 % . The patient in SP Group will also have supraclavicular block that will be performed in the same way as the previous group and then patient is placed in the supine position with the arm abducted 90 degrees position to receive Peg 11 lock by injecting 10ml of lidocaine 2 % between pectoralis minor and serratus anterior at 3rd rib level using a 38-mm high frequency ( 9-12 MHz ) linear array transducer with the in-plane approach . The sensory and motor blocks will be evaluated every 5 min for 30 min or until blocks will be complete . An adequate surgical anesthesia will be defined as a motor score of ≥1 , with an absence of pinprick sensations in the area of all the four terminal nerves . The zero time for onset of sensory and motor blocks will be the completion of the LA injection . Sensory block assessment ( 0 , no block 1 , loss of sensation of pinprick 2 , loss of sensation of touch ) will be performed in the innervations of the four nerve areas , radial ( radial dorsum of the hand ) , median ( thenar eminence ) , ulnar ( hypothenar eminence ) , and intercostobrachial ( medial upper arm ) corresponding to the nerve distributions in the forearm and hand using the pinprick test , and will be compared with the same stimulation on the contra-lateral arm . The degree of motor block will be evaluated by thumb abduction ( radial nerve ) , thumb adduction ( ulnar nerve ) , and thumb opposition ( median nerve ) , using a 3-point scale ( 0 =normal motor function , 1 = decreased motor strength , 2 = complete motor block ) . The onset times of the sensory block ( the time between the end of the LA injection and the total abolition of the pinprick response ) and motor block ( time between the end of the LA injection and complete motor block ) will be recorded for each nerve . Patients who will not achieve satisfactory levels of anesthesia and will need intraoperative local infiltration will be recorded .Patient in whom the block failed and local infiltration is not enough will receive general anesthesia ( propofol 2mg/kg plus fentanyl 1ug/kg and atracurium 0.5mg/kg ) with laryngeal mask airway inserted for mechanical ventilation . Postoperative pain will be assessed by one of the authors using a visual analog scale ( 0 , no pain ; 10 , worst pain imaginable ) . Analgesic for the first complain of pain will be standardized and consisted of 500 mg of oral or intravenous paracetamol given for a pain score of 4 of visual analog scale.The time to first analgesic requirement will be also recorded by the same author . Heart rate , peripheral oxygen saturation , respiratory rate , and blood pressure will be measured before the supraclavicular block and 5 , 10 , 20 , 30 , 45 , and 60 min after the block and thereafter every 60 min for 2 h postoperatively . University of Michigan Sedation Scale ( UMSS ) ( 1 , awake and alert ; 2 , sedated , responding to verbal stimulus ; 3 , sedated , responding to strong physical stimulus ; 4 , not arousable ) will be measured first as baseline before the block then at the same time points for measuring vital signs post-block .",2020-03-09,"May 14, 2020","Inclusion Criteria : American Society of Anesthesiologists Grade III , age 25-75 years who are scheduled for brachio-basilic AVF .

A non-randomized clinical trial was carried out in the Department of dermatology in Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Center , Karachi . All patients with mild , moderate and severe psoriasis with age above 13 years without any co-morbid , were prescribed tablet Naltrexone 6 mg daily after assessing PASI , BSA and DLQI scores before starting treatment . Patients were called monthly for follow up to monitor lipid profiles and liver function tests . After 3 months of treatment , PASI , BSA and DLQI scores were assessed again . The results were significant when analysed with paired t test in SPSS 23 .","Psoriasis is a chronic T-cell mediated disorder . The activated T cell secretes cytokines that result in keratinocytes hyper-proliferation and abnormal differentiation . These cytokines result in chemo-taxis of neutrophils and lymphocytes in skin . It is a multi-factorial disease . Individual has genetic susceptibility for psoriasis , but environmental factors trigger the disease like infections , drugs , cold , trauma and stress . It is a multi-system disease but mainly affects skin , nails and joints . It impacts adversely on patients ' quality of life , causes embarrassment , limitation in clothing choice , psychological distress which further aggravates the disease . It impacts economically due to off days from work as well . In its most common form , it presents as salmon pink plaques , covering with thick silver scales , mostly on scalp , trunk , buttocks and external surfaces of limbs . In the management of psoriasis , there are multiple treatment options which includes topical , systemic and photo-therapy . But all have their side effects and contraindication . Low dose naltrexone ( LDN ) is an attractive emergent therapy with analgesic , anti-pruritic and anti-inflammatory properties for various dermatological disorders including psoriasis . In this study , the effectiveness of low dose naltrexone in cases of psoriasis was assessed . The study was conducted in the department of dermatology in Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre , Karachi , after receiving approval letter from the institutional ethical and research committee of the hospital.Forty two patients were selected of either gender with age ranging from 13-60 years , after excluding hypertension , cardiovascular disorders , pregnancy and lactation . The procedure has been explained to each patient & written consent has been taken . Before prescribing LDN treatment , Psoriasis area and severity index ( PASI ) , Body surface area ( BSA ) and Dermatology life quality index ( DLQI ) has been calculated . Each case has prescribed tablet naltrexone 6mg daily after checking all baselines investigations of complete blood picture , renal and liver function profiles . The cases were asked to follow up monthly to observe patient compliance , response of medicine and its side effects . After 3 months of treatment , PASI , BSA and DLQI have been calculated to assess the effectiveness of treatment . PASI score is used to measure the severity and extent of disease , in terms of intensities of erythema , induration and scaling of lesion and the area of body involved with disease . Body surface area ( BSA ) is calculated through 'rule of nine ' which is a convenient and rapid method of estimating the extent of body surface area affected with disease . If BSA is 10 % , it is categorized as mild , moderate and severe disease , respectively .

These traits have the potential to improve adherence in patients who have intolerance to the integrase inhibitor class . We propose a two part study design to evaluate if patients who have suboptimal adherence due to integrase inhibitor intolerance may better tolerate Symtuza and subsequently have improved adherence .","With the advent of anti-retroviral therapy , HIV transformed into a manageable chronic disease for patients who were able to obtain medications , provided they could remain adherent to them . When single tablet regimens ( STR ) became available , adherence to HIV medications was made easier for many patients . However even years after STR became available , 38 % of patients reported they do not maintain optimal adherence to their HIV medications . While there are many factors that contribute to this problem , medication intolerance contributes to suboptimal adherence for many patients Darunavir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide ( Symtuza ) is a coformulated STR , is the only protease inhibitor based STR , and is noted for its high tolerability .

Post-randomization , all participants will complete an alcohol cue-reactivity paradigm prior to the initial dose of study medication . After a week-long medication titration period , participants will be asked to complete a 7-day practice quit attempt , during which they will have daily virtual visits ( phone and online ) where they will report on their alcohol use . Additionally , a second cue-reactivity paradigm will be conducted 90 minutes following study drug administration on final day of the practice quit attempt ( Day 14 ) .","Recruitment : Participants will be recruited from the community through online and newspaper advertisements . Campaigns in local buses and print publications ( e.g. , LA Weekly ) will also be implemented . Targeted recruitment will also take place through a lab database of previous study participants who agreed to be contacted for future studies . Telephone Screen : Individuals who call the lab ( in response to flyers and advertisements ) expressing interest in the study will receive detailed information about the study procedures , and if they remain interested they will complete a telephone screen performed by a trained research assistant for self-reported inclusion and exclusion criteria . Those who appear eligible will be invited to the laboratory for an initial in-person screening session . Initial Screening : Prior to conducting any research related procedures , research staff will conduct the informed consent process , which details the procedures to take place during the screening visit . Informed consent will be a three-part process . First , participants will be asked to read and provide verbal consent for breathalyzer . If the breathalyzer is above 0.000 , the visit will be stopped and the participant will not be compensated . The participant will be given an opportunity to reschedule the visit for another day . If the breathalyzer test is negative , the written informed consent form will be reviewed and signed by the participant and study staff outlining procedures for the initial screening visit . A second written consent form will be reviewed and signed in the presence of the study physician at the medical screening visit if the participant is found eligible to continue to that visit . At the initial screening visit , subjects will be asked to provide a urine sample to test for drugs of abuse and pregnancy ( if female ) , and will complete a series of questionnaires and interviews ( described in detail below ) to determine initial eligibility . This visit will take approximately 1 hour . Following the initial in-person screening , the study coordinator will meet with the PI to determine if the participant is eligible to continue to the medical screening based on study inclusion/exclusion criteria . Medical Screening : Those participants who appear to be eligible after the initial screening visit , will then be scheduled for a second screening visit . This visit will be conducted by the study physician and will start with a breathalyzer test . If the breathalyzer is above 0.000 , the visit will be stopped and the participant will not be compensated . The participant will be given an opportunity to reschedule the visit for another day . If the breathalyzer test is negative , the physician will conduct the second written ( experimental ) consent ; medical history interview and physical exam . In addition , a urine sample will be obtained for repeat drug screen and pregnancy tests . The participant will then be accompanied by research personnel to the CTRC for blood specimen collection including Comprehensive Metabolic Panel and Complete Blood Count to evaluate overall health ; and EKG to screen for medical conditions that could make study participation medically unsafe . The study physician will review each participant 's medical history , vital signs , weight , review of systems , and laboratory tests , including liver function tests ( LFTs ) , drug screen , chemistry screen , and urine pregnancy screen to determine if it is medically safe for the participant to take the study medication . Any subject who is excluded from the study will be compensated for their time in the screening session and will be offered referrals for alcohol treatment in the community . Randomization and Medication Titration : Participants who are eligible after the physical exam will be randomized to one of three treatment conditions ( VAR , NTX , or PLA ) . Urn randomization will be used to balance the groups by gender , smoking status ( as reported on question 1 of the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence ) , and drinking status ( 'heavy ' drinker defined as 28 or more drinks per week for males/14 or more drinks per week for females , or 'very heavy ' drinker , defined as 35 or more drinks per week for males/28 or more drinks per week for females ) . The UCLA Research Pharmacy will manage the blind . The three treatment conditions will not be different in appearance or method of administration . All participants will undergo a week-long medication titration period prior to the onset of the practice quit attempt . Practice-Quit Attempt : During the practice-quit attempt , participants will be instructed to abstain completely from drinking alcohol during a 7-day practice quit period . This period will begin on Day 8 of study medication dosing . During this period , participants will complete daily virtual visits to report on their drinking , mood and craving for alcohol during the previous day in a daily diary assessment ( DDA ) . Study Medication : On Day 1 , participants will report to the laboratory to complete the alcohol cue-reactivity paradigm and receive their first medication dose under direct observation of study staff . They will receive a 7-day supply of study medication in blister packs with AM and PM dosing clearly distinguished for the titration procedure . After reaching full medication dose at the end of one week , participants will come to the laboratory on Day 8 to begin the practice quit attempt and to take AM dose of study medication daily in the lab under direct observation of study staff . Additionally , on the first day of the practice-quit attempt ( Day 8 ) , participants will receive a second 7-day supply of study medication . All study medication will be prepared by the UCLA Research Pharmacy and will be identically matched in appearance ( opaque capsules with 50 mg of riboflavin to aid in medication compliance procedures ) and the medication labels will not reveal the drug identity . Alcohol Cue Reactivity Sessions ( CR ) : Randomized participants will complete a cue-exposure paradigm at two time points during the study , once on Day 1 prior to ingesting the first dose of study medication , and again on Day 14 , approximately 90 minutes after study drug administration . Alcohol cue exposure will follow well-established experimental procedures . Sessions will begin with a 3-minute relaxation period . Participants will then hold and smell a glass of water for 3 minutes to control for the effects of simple exposure to any potable liquid . Next , participants will hold and smell a glass of their preferred alcoholic beverage for 3 minutes . Order is not counterbalanced because of carryover effects that are known to occur . Participants ( who are smokers ) will be allowed a smoke break immediately prior to the CR assessment . After every 3 minutes of exposure , participants will rate their urge to drink on the Alcohol Urge Questionnaire ( AUQ ) and their mood on the Profile of Mood States ( POMS ) . AUQ score ( alcohol minus water ) is the primary outcome for the CR . Brief Counseling Session : All participants will meet with a trained study counselor briefly after the second cue exposure session on Day 14 to discuss their responses to the alcohol cues and discuss local treatment options . The counselor will begin by introducing him/herself and thanking the participant for his/her participation . He/she will continue by providing the participant with feedback on their responses on various individual difference measures ( drinking patterns , severity of AUD diagnosis , family history , CIWA , depression , and other drug use ) . The counselor will probe for participants ' attitudes towards these responses and diagnoses , and provide both informational and emotional support . Next , the counselor will go over the participant 's history of alcohol treatment , in order to identify potential barriers to treatment access . He/she will discuss local treatment options with the participant , including the participant 's primary care provider , self-help groups , and the UCLA Psychology Clinic . Lastly , the counselor will go over the `` Rethinking Drinking '' pamphlet with the participant , pointing out specific treatment options discussed in the session , and will address any questions or concerns .",2020-01-24,"October 10, 2022","Inclusion Criteria : Be between the ages of 21 and 65 Meet current ( i.e. , past 12-month ) DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for AUD moderate or severe Have intrinsic motivation to reduce or quit drinking ( defined as self-reported intention to reduce or quit drinking within the next 6 months ) Report drinking at least 28 drinks per week if male ( 14 drinks per week if female ) in the 28 days prior to the initial consent Have reliable internet access Exclusion Criteria : Have a current ( last 12 months ) DSM-5 diagnosis of substance use disorder for any psychoactive substances other than alcohol and nicotine Have a lifetime DSM-5 diagnosis of schizophrenia , bipolar disorder , or any psychotic disorder Have a positive urine screen for drugs other than cannabis Have clinically significant alcohol withdrawal symptoms as indicated by a score ≥ 10 on the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol-Revised ( CIWA-R ) Have an intense fear of needles or have had any adverse reactions to needle puncture Be pregnant , nursing , or planning to become pregnant while taking part in the study ; and must agree to one of the following methods of birth control ( if female ) , unless she or partner are surgically sterile : Oral contraceptives Contraceptive sponge Patch Double barrier Intrauterine contraceptive device Etonogestrel implant Medroxyprogesterone acetate contraceptive injection Complete abstinence from sexual intercourse Hormonal vaginal contraceptive ring Have a medical condition that may interfere with safe study participation ( e.g. , unstable cardiac , renal , or liver disease , uncontrolled hypertension or diabetes ) Be currently taking any psychotropic medications that , in the opinion of the investigators , compromises participant safety Be currently taking or have had previous experience with either naltrexone or varenicline Have any other circumstances that , in the opinion of the investigators , compromises participant safety",53,0,21 Years,65 Years

The specific aims are : Aim 1 . Map the formation of specialized pro-resolving mediators and their relationship to acute tissue inflammation Aim 2 . Determine the influence of omega-3 fatty acids on the formation and action of pro-resolving mediators during acute inflammation . Medical history and clinical information will be obtained from the participant 's health record for study purposes to be sure that participants meet the appropriate inclusion and exclusion criteria . The phlebotomy and topical application of the cantharidin , the imaging and clinical assessment and sampling of blister exudates will be performed by Dr. Katherine Walker or Dr. Joseph Merola and clinical study team at Brigham and Women 's Hospital in the Building For Transformative Medicine ( 3rd floor , 60 Fenwood Road , Boston , MA ) . The biochemical , immunological and histological analyses will be performed in the laboratories of Drs . Bruce Levy and Charles Serhan at BWH in the Building For Transformative Medicine ( 3rd floor , 60 Fenwood Road ) . The intervention protocol will involve simultaneous topical application of 12.5 mcl 0.1 % cantharidin to two sites on the volar surface of one forearm . This dose is known to elicit a consistent , safe , localized reaction entailing redness ( erythema ) , mild tenderness and warmth at the site , 2-3 cm in diameter . Subsequently , blister exudative fluid will be removed from each blister site , one during onset phase of inflammation ( 24 hrs after cantharidin ) and the second during resolution phase ( 72 hrs after cantharidin ) . The blister exudates will be sampled by piercing the roof of the blister with a sterile needle to collect the exudate at designated time points . The site is disinfected prior to collection of the blister exudate and subsequently protected by a wound dressing after the sample collection step . The intervention protocol will be performed twice for each participant , under 2 distinct conditions : without omega-3 fatty acid supplementation with omega-3 fatty acid supplementation : the participant will take 4 capsules ( 1gram each ) of Lovaza daily at 8pm , starting the evening before blister induction and continuing until the second blister fluid has been removed . This study is a crossover design to evaluate the production of pro-resolving mediators and resolution of experimental inflammation with and without additional omega-3 fatty acid supplementation , and to allow each subject to serve as an internal control by undergoing blister formation in both conditions . In order to reduce the influence of repeated cantharidin blister exposures on the outcome measurements , subjects will be randomized to start with either the Lovaza arm or the non-supplementation arm of the blister protocol .",2020-03-10,"May 25, 2022","Inclusion Criteria : Healthy adults Ages 18-64 Exclusion Criteria : Known acute or chronic infection Known acute or chronic disease of any kind Known allergy to fish or shellfish Use of any prescription medication Use of over-the-counter medication except multivitamins Use of dietary or herbal supplement except protein supplements Women that are pregnant , trying to become pregnant , or breastfeeding Any skin disease Known immunocompromise , HIV , or Diabetes mellitus History of cardiopulmonary disease History of upper extremity cellulitis Significant allergy of any kind Known bleeding diathesis History of keloid scar formation Forearm tattoo Use of Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs ( NSAIDs ) during study or within 2 weeks prior to enrollment .",19,0,18 Years,64 Years

Sickle cell hemoglobin cells are stiff and sticky and form into the shape of a sickle , or the letter `` C , '' when they lose their oxygen .

Patients with certain risk factors seem to die by an overwhelming reaction of the immune system to the virus , causing a cytokine storm with features of Cytokine-Release Syndrome ( CRS ) and Macrophage Activation Syndrome ( MAS ) and resulting in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ( ARDS ) . Several pro-inflammatory cytokines are elevated in the plasma of patients and features of MAS in COVID-19 , include elevated levels of ferritin , d-dimer , and low platelets . There is increasing data that cytokine-targeted biological therapies can improve outcomes in CRS or MAS and even in sepsis . Tocilizumab ( TCZ ) , an anti-IL-6R biological therapy , has been approved for the treatment of CRS and is used in patients with MAS . Based on these data , it is hypothesized that TCZ can reduce mortality in patients with severe COVID-19 prone to CRS and ARDS . The overall purpose of this study is to evaluate whether treatment with TCZ reduces the severity and mortality in patients with COVID-19 .","Background and Rationale The Acute Respiratory Syndrome by Corona Virus 2 ( SARS-CoV-2 ) , first discovered in December 2019 in Wuhan/China , is causing a worldwide pandemic with potentially lethal implications on an individual basis , and , on the large scale bringing the health care systems and the economy to its limits . The mortality rate of this COronaVIrus induced Disease , COVID-19 , has been estimated by the World Health Organization ( WHO ) to be 3.7 % , which is more than 10-fold higher than the mortality of influenza . An infection with SARS-CoV-2 may cause an excessive host immune response , leading to an Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ( ARDS ) and death . Reports from China and from Italy describe an overwhelming inflammation which is triggered by the virus , causing a cytokine storm with features of Cytokine-Release Syndrome ( CRS ) and/or Macrophage Activation Syndrome ( MAS ) . Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as Interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) are elevated in the plasma of patients and features of MAS in COVID-19 include elevated levels of ferritin , d-dimer and low platelets . There is increasing evidence , that cytokine-targeted biological therapies can improve outcomes in CRS or MAS and even in sepsis . In recognition of the dramatic development of the COVID-19 pandemic , and in a pragmatic manner , already approved and safe therapies should be evaluated for the use in severe COVID-19 . Tocilizumab ( TCZ ) , an anti-IL-6R biological therapy , has been approved for the treatment of CRS and is used in patients with MAS ( and in other rheumatologic conditions like Rheumatoid Arthritis ( RA ) or Giant Cell Arteritis ( GCA ) , with a good safety profile also in the elderly ) .

Instituto Nacional de Cancerologia de Mexico,NCT04338867,Nitroglycerin Plus Intracranial Radiotherapy for Brain Metastases in NSCLC Patients,Instituto Nacional de Cancerologia de Mexico,2,1,Phase II Clinical Trial,Radiation,Whole-brain radiotherapy,Treatment,,"Background : Whole-brain radiotherapy ( WBRT ) is the standard treatment for multiple brain metastases ( BM ) , in NSCLC patients who are not candidates for treatment with stereotactic radiation body therapy . Hypoxia has been associated with chemo-radioresistance secondary to Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor ( VEGFR ) induced by Hypoxia Induced Factor ( HIF ) . Nitroglycerin ( NTG ) can reduce HIF-1 alfa in tissues , and this may have anti-angiogenic , pro-apoptotic and anti-efflux effects . In this phase II study , we evaluated the effect of transdermal nitroglycerin ( TN ) on intracranial progression-free survival ( ICPFS ) , objective response rate ( ORR ) and overall survival ( OS ) of NSCLC patients with BM . Material and methods : We performed an open-label , phase II clinical trial among ninety-six histologically confirmed NSCLC patients with BM . Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive NTG plus WBRT or WBRT alone . ORR and ICPFS were evaluated by MRI by two independent , blinded radio-oncologists .","Non-small cell Lung cancer ( NSCLC ) is the most frequent type of lung cancer worldwide . Brain metastases ( BM ) are the most frequent neurological complications related to NSCLC and it is estimated that 20 % to 40 % of these patients will present them at some point during the progression of their disease , leading to a poor prognosis . As only a selected group of NSCLC patients with single metastases or small lesions are candidates for surgical resection or SBRT , the standard treatment for multiple BM is whole-brain radiation therapy ( WBRT ) . Although 80 % of the patients who receive WRBT can initially respond to treatment , 50 % of these patients will have disease progression . This further has been related to genetic and environmental factors that may lead to radio-resistance , which is the capacity of a cell to stand the effects of radiant energy . To face this problem , other options such as chemotherapy or radio-sensitizers have shown slight benefit in terms of progression-free survival ( PFS ) but not in overall survival ( OS ) . Different studies have suggested tumor microenvironment ( TME ) has an important role in treatment response of BM-derived from melanoma and NSCLC . The demand for O2 by tumors during cancer is an unsteady phenomenon , caused by continuous metabolic profile changes , immune response activity , and TME interactions . Hypoxia occurs in most tumors and plays an important role in tumor progression . In NSCLC exists a clear relationship between hypoxia and radioresistance . Hence , there is interest into modulate TME hypoxia to improve treatment response . Hypoxia regulates the expression of genes that encode growth factors such as endothelin-1 ( ET-1 ) , growth factor-derived platelets-B ( PDGF ) and vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , as well as genes that regulate the production of gas molecules such as nitric oxide ( NO ) and carbon monoxide ( CO ) . The hypoxia-inducible factor ( HIF ) is a transcription factor that regulates the cellular response to hypoxia , functioning as a regulator of oxygen homeostasis . Several studies have shown that over-expression of HIF-1α is capable of inducing resistance to chemotherapy , radiotherapy and decreasing overall survival in NSCLC primary tumors . The administration of nitric oxide donors , such as nitroglycerin , reduces the tumor resistance related to hypoxia by inducing the direct proteolysis of HIF-1α . In tumor cells increases oxygen pressure , increased blood flow , activation of p53 and apoptosis have shown a synergistic effect with ionizing irradiation in an experimental model . According to several randomized phase II studies , the addition of transdermal nitroglycerin to vinorelbine and cisplatin treatment can significantly improve the OS and time to progression in patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer . However , in phase III the addition of nitroglycerin to carboplatin-based did not show benefit in PFS , OS and health-related quality of life ( PMID : 26347110 ) . Therefore , the aim of this study was to assess , if the addition of transdermal NTG to standard WRBT treatment among stage IV NSCLC patients with BM , could have a significant impact in PFS and OS as primary end-point and disease control rate ( DCR ) and overall response rate ( ORR ) as secondary endpoints . METHODS Experimental design We conducted a phase II clinical trial with a parallel design study among patients treated at the Instituto Nacional de Cancerología from January 2014 to May 2017 . The Median follows up was 18 months . Patients with histologically confirmed NSCLC and documented BM defined as the presence of one or more intra-axial enhancing lesions on gadolinium-enhanced brain magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) were included . Candidate patients who underwent radiosurgery or surgical resection were excluded . Sample size . The sample size calculation was estimated for a two-sample proportion difference in ORR for NSCLC patients who received WBRT plus TN . Although in one of our previous studies we found a difference of 40 % in ORR among locally advanced NSCLC patients 30 , we prefer to be more conservative in our estimations taking into account our different study populations . Thus , our sample estimation assumptions were performed for a difference in ORR ( delta ) of 30 % between population ( p1= 25 % vs p2= 65 % ) with a study power was set at 0.80 and the two-sided type I error ( alpha ) was set as 0.05 . Therefore , the estimated sample number is 108 ( 54 per group ) . We also add a 5 % of extra patients , to prevent the possible loss of patients due to the progression of the disease . Endpoints . The primary outcome was overall response rate ( ORR ) ; Secondary endpoints were disease control rate ( DCR ) , intracranial progression-free survival ( ICPFS ) and overall survival ( OS ) . The radiographic response was assessed by two independent blinded radiologists according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) guideline version 1.1 by comparing the pre-and post-treatment images . Any in-field tumor progression or the appearance of new malignant lesions denoted progressive disease . ORR was defined as the sum of complete and partial response , whereas DCR was defined as the sum of ORR and stable disease . For PFS , time to event was defined and calculated from the date of randomization until radiographic disease progression , treatment discontinuation due to either unacceptable toxicity death by any cause . For OS , time-to-event was defined as time from randomization until death by any cause or loss to follow-up . Observations for patients who did not experience the event were censored at patient-specific last follow-up . Finally , treatment toxicity was evaluated with CTCAE criteria . Intervention assignment and informed consent Patients were randomized 1:1 and allocated to either the control arm who received whole-brain radiotherapy ( WBRT ) ( 30 Gy in 10 fractions , in 10 days of treatment ) or the experimental arm who received WBRT and the addition 36 mg of transdermal nitroglycerin ( TN ) with release of 10 mg in 24 hours , for 24 hours with a 12-hour rest interval ( to avoid saturation of receptors ) . All patients signed the informed consent letter , prior to any procedure . The project was approved by the local scientific and bioethics committee ( number ) . Further details can be found in clinicaltrials.gov ( NCT¿ ? ) . Patients received chemotherapy ( CT ) platinum-based or TKI according to mutation status . Response assessment BM was documented among all patients at NSCLC diagnosis and staging by either computed tomography ( CT ) of the head gadolinium-enhanced brain magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) at baseline . Then , all patients underwent an MRI prior to treatment and at the end of treatment ( median 15 days ) . The imaging studies were carried out in a Signa HDxt 1.5 T scanner ( GE Healthcare ) . They include conventional sequences in multiple planes , T1 , T2 , T2 Flair , Echo gradient , Diffusion , volumetric acquisition in axial plane T1 Spoiled Gradient recalled ( SPGR ) , without contrast and after this ( Gadolinium ) . Cerebral perfusion was evaluated by echo-planar sequence with the following parameters : multiphase ( 25 - 45 phases ) with an acquisition time of 1:10 , with a PSI of 5 and a flow rate of 5 ; with a volume of 15ml of gadolinium ( + ) 20ml of saline at a speed of 5ml/second . The radiographic response of intracranial tumors was assessed by two blinded and independent blinded radio-oncologist ( MY & FM ) according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) guideline version 1.1 by comparing the pre-and post-treatment intracranial images [ 15 ] . Any in-field tumor progression or the appearance of new malignant lesions denoted progressive disease . Objective response was defined as the sum of complete and partial response . DNA Extraction Biopsies were taken using CT-guided tru-cut or bronchoscopy and were analyzed by the pathology department for their histologic diagnosis and neoplastic cellularity quantification ( > 50 % ) ; they were later embedded in paraffin until processed for DNA extraction . Genomic DNA was extracted from the areas of paraffin slides using a standard procedure and a QIAamp DNA FFPE tissue kit ( TMQIAGEN ) , following manufacturer 's instructions . Determination of EGFR and KRAS mutational status EGFR exon 19 , exon 20 and exon 21 gene mutations were detected using the Therascreen RGQ PCR kit ( TMQIAGEN , Scorpions ARMS method ) , which combines both the ARMS and Scorpions technologies for detecting the mutations by real-time polymerase chain reactions ( PCR ) . Real-time PCR was performed using a Rotor-Gene Q 5plex HRM ( TMQIAGEN ) , following manufacturer 's instructions . Statistical analysis Continuous variables were summarized as arithmetic means or medians , with standard deviation or interquartile range for descriptive purposes according to normal data distribution assessed by means of the Shapiro-Swilk test . Meanwhile , categorical variables were summarized as frequencies and percentages . For dichotomous outcomes ( eg . objective response rate ( ORR ) , disease control rate ( DCR ) , the percentage ( incidence rate ) and 95 % CI are presented . Inferential comparisons were made using the T-test or two-way ANOVA for continuous variables and with either Mann-Whitney U test or Kruskall-Wallis test , conforming to the data distribution and a number of groups . The χ2 test or Fisher exact test was used for assessing the statistical significance of categorical variables . To address the effect of treatment of secondary outcomes ( eg . OS , ICPFS ) we performed univariate survival analysis . Time-to-event was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and comparisons among the subgroups were analyzed using the log-rank test . For survival curve analysis , all the variables were dichotomized according to their median . After we performed a forward stepwise Multivariable Cox regression model and hazard ratios ( HR ) were calculated along with their corresponding 95 % CIs as a measure of association . Statistically and clinically significant and borderline significant variables ( p < .10 ) were included for the adjustment in the multivariate Cox regression model . Significantly Kaplan-Meir curves were plotted . Statistical significance was determined as P < 0.05 using a 2-tailed test . Stata software version 14 was used for all statistical analyses .",2020-03-05,"April 20, 2020",Inclusion Criteria : Patients with histologically confirmed NSCLC with documented BM ( defined as the presence of one or more intra-axial enhancing lesions on gadolinium-enhanced brain magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) Exclusion Criteria : Candidate patients who underwent radiosurgery or surgery resection,96,0,18 Years,90 Years

On February 11,2020 , the World Health Organization officially named the disease caused by the new coronavirus `` COVID-19 '' . The Chinese Government takes stronger and harsher measures to control the progression of its outbreak . Meanwhile , five editions of `` Diagnosis and Treatment for Novel Coronavirus-Infected Pneumonia '' has been timely and continuously issued , which play extremely important roles in guiding the clinical management of COVID-19 nationwide in China . The symptoms of human infection with SARS-CoV-2 are generally fever , fatigue , dry cough and dyspnea . Noteworthy , a considerable percentage of COVID-19 cases have rapidly progressed to severe and critical type , among which acute lung injury ( ALI ) and acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) are the most common complications , resulting in a large number of pneumonia hospitalized patients requiring supplemental oxygen , mechanical ventilation , or even ECMO.Pulmonary edema is a detrimental feature as well as a key causal factor of ALI/ARDS . Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor ( VEGF ) is considered as the most potent vascular permeability inducers . Recent evidence has revealed higher VEGF levels in COVID-19 patients compared with healthy controls .

This is completed by taking oral contraceptives ( birth control ) continuously for three months . Prior to medication administration and at the end of treatment , eating behaviors will be measured and fMRI will be conducted in order to examine changes in activation in dopamine-reward pathways that occur with oral contraceptive administration . This will assess changes in brain activation that occur with the stabilization of ovarian hormones .","Eating disorders ( EDs ) affect 15 million women in the United States and have one of the highest mortality rates of any mental illness . Despite this , the underlying neurobiology remains poorly understood . EDs predominantly occur in women , and the frequency of certain symptoms change in a predictable pattern over the menstrual cycle ; specifically , symptom changes appear to be triggered by normal fluctuations in the ovarian hormones estradiol ( E2 ) and progesterone ( P4 ) . The objective of this study is to examine the impact of ovarian hormone stabilization , through the continuous administration of oral contraceptives ( OCs ) for 3-months , on brain activation in response to reward and eating behaviors in women who binge eat ( n=15 ) using functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) and behavioral testing . OCs work by suppressing ovulation , thereby reducing E2 and P4 changes that occur pre- and post- ovulation . Because the traditional 21/7 regimen of OC administration ( 21 active pills followed by 7 days of inactive pills ) allows follicles to begin to develop , this leads to the secretion of endogenous E2 , and then E2 withdrawal once active pills begin again . This does not result in consistent stabilization . Thus , this study will use OCs in a continuous manner , with no inactive pills . Participants will complete fMRI imaging and self-report questionnaires prior to OC administration and at the end of OC administration . The investigators will examine within-subject changes that occur in these measures with OC administration . The primary hypothesis is that continuous OC treatment will have a beneficial/stabilizing effect on outcomes of interest . Specifically , symptomatology may decrease from OC use . Results will ultimately provide the pilot data necessary for larger mechanistic trials .

Although all have side effects , they offer a lower risk than that conferred by pregnancy Contraceptive methods are classified according to their effectiveness . The top tier offer the highest level of effectiveness ( defined as < two pregnancies per 100 women per year ) and fulfill the criteria of ease of use , long duration of action , minimal need for return visits to the clinic and minimal user motivation or intervention . These methods include intrauterine contraception , sub dermal contraceptive implants and male and female sterilization The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists encourages all women , especially adolescents , to use long-acting reversible contraception . Although intrauterine devices ( IUDs ) are safe , reliable and highly effective forms of long- acting reversible contraception and has a very low failure rate ( 0.2-0.6 per 100 women per year ) , it is used by only 7.6 % and 14.5 % of contraceptive users in developed and developing countries , respectively According to the latest practice recommendations for contraceptive use by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , the potential barriers to IUD use include anticipated insertion pain and health care providers ' concerns about difficult insertion ( It is therefore important to identify effective approaches to ease IUD insertion in order to overcome obstacles hindering IUD use Insertion-associated pain is related to speculum insertion , tenaculum traction on the cervix , sounding of the uterus , passing of the insertion tube through the cervix and placement of the device within the uterine cavity Failure of insertion occurs in up to 14 % and 20 % of parous and nulliparous women , respectively 13 ) . It has been suggested that difficulty and failure of insertion are experienced more in nulliparous women ( adjusted odds ratio [ AOR ] 5.19 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 2.49 , 10.82 ) and in those with previous Caesarean delivery ( AOR 5.38 ; 95 % CI 2.58 , 11.22 ) , due to a narrower cervical os Fouda et al . found that women who had delivered only by Caesarean section experienced more pain with IUD insertion compared with women with previous vaginal delivery Many investigators have studied how to minimize insertion pain or failure . Few studies , however , have assessed any measure to decrease pain or difficulty during IUD insertion in women with previous Caesarean delivery ( and no prior vaginal delivery ) Pergialiotis et al . conducted a meta-analysis of clinical trials of analgesic options for IUD placement . Owing to the small number of trials , however , they concluded that further studies were needed before a conclusion could be reached Misoprostol is a synthetic analog of prostaglandin E1 originally approved for treatment and prevention of gastric ulcers induced by non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs . It can be administered sublingually , orally , vaginally , or rectally . Vaginal administration has been associated with the highest peak serum levels of misoprostol , and overall bioavailability is greatest for sublingual and vaginal administration . Misoprostol has well-known cervical ripening and uterotonic effects , naturally leading to its use as an adjunct in many gynecologic procedures . Its use has been well studied in the hysteroscopy literature . Multiple well-designed studies have validated the efficacy of different doses of misoprostol before hysteroscopy in reducing pain with dilation , reducing the number of failed dilations , and increasing cervical canal diameter before dilation Given these data , it is reasonable to hypothesize that pretreatment with misoprostol could aid in IUD insertion . As existing studies examining this question have asserted varied conclusions , through this study investigators will evaluate and compare the safety and efficacy of different doses of misoprostol prior to IUCD insertion among women with nulliparous cervix beside the rate of occurrence of adverse effects .

"Rigshospitalet, Denmark",NCT04280055,Prophylactic Effects of Psilocybin on Chronic Cluster Headache,Gitte Moos Knudsen,1,0,Cluster Headache,Drug,Psilocybin,Treatment,,"The purpose of this study is to investigate the prophylactic effects of psilocybin in chronic cluster headache . Subjects will receive a low dose of psilocybin during 3 sessions spaced by one week . Subjects will maintain a headache diary prior to , during , and after the administrations in order to document headache frequency , intensity and duration . Subjects will undergo a fMRI scanning before the first and after the last psilocybin session .","Cluster headache ( CH ) is one of the most painful conditions known . CH affects 1 out 1000 and exists in two well-defined forms : episodic ( ECH ) and chronic ( CCH ) . Ten to fifteen percent of patients have CCH and have less than three months of pain-free time during a year . Medical treatment for CH is divided into acute abortive treatment for the single attack and a prophylactic treatment . The most commonly used prophylactic , verapamil , decreases attack frequency but does not induce remission and very high doses are needed . Although most therapeutic options ameliorate CH , they may be problematic due to major side effects , unsatisfactory treatment response or availability . Thus , novel treatment options are needed . According to several studies , patients that self-medicate with low doses of the serotonin 2A receptor ( 5-HT2AR ) agonist and psychedelic psilocybin report that this is effective as CH prophylaxis or even to induce remission . So far , no clinical trials to confirm this have been conducted , nor is there any objective measures of brain function in association with psilocybin intake in CH . There is , however , already some evidence from functional magnetic resonance ( fMRI ) imaging studies suggesting that CH patients have abnormal functional connectivity patterns involving the hypothalamus and distributed brain networks , but the implication of these abnormalities is unknown . The investigators are conducting a prospective pilot study , evaluating prophylactic effects of psilocybin in CCH using an open-label study design . They 're also going to investigate psilocybin 's active metabolite psilocin and brain function ( fMRI ) to identify possible brain mechanisms underlying CCH and treatment response , including the correlation of treatment response with psilocin levels and estimated 5-HT2AR occupancy and the extent to which brain network changes are affected by psilocybin and correlated with treatment response . Effects of psilocybin on headache frequency , duration and intensity will be assessed in a sample of 20 patients with CCH . Participants will fill out headache logs during the entire study period , in total 10 weeks . Before study inclusion , participants taking prophylactic medication will first go through a 2-week wash-out period to allow for elimination of the medicine . Inclusion is followed by a baseline observation period lasting four weeks , after which patients will first undergo a baseline rs fMRI scanning followed by the first dose of 0.14 mg/kg psilocybin p.o . Blood samples will be collected during the first psilocybin intervention to establish psilocin plasma concentrations , which will be used for estimating receptor occupancy . Participants will then undergo two additional psilocybin administrations spaced by one-week . The last psilocybin dose will be followed by 4 weeks of observation . One week after the last administration of psilocybin , participants will undergo a follow-up MRI scan . Participants will be contacted 3 , 6 and 12 months after the last psilocybin dose to gain information about the duration of potential remission periods . All regular acute treatments are permitted during the study period and a systematic record hereof has to be noted in the headache diary . No other prophylactic medication is allowed during the trial and at least a two-week washout period before inclusion is required . Prophylactics are allowed again after the 4 weeks follow-up , with dose and type carefully recorded . Participants will fill out questionnaires during the observation period , in conjunction with psilocybin interventions and at follow-up .",2020-02-12,"August 8, 2022",Inclusion Criteria : Age between 18 and 65 A diagnosis of chronic cluster headache according to IHCD-III .

This condition presents a clinical conundrum as it predisposes older obese individuals to a high risk for disability , morbidity and mortality . Insulin resistance , chronic inflammation , elevations in intrahepatic lipid and detrimental alterations in the gut microbiome are also evident . The application of caloric restriction-induced weight loss ( CRWL ) used to address these health risks in younger individuals may exacerbate muscle wasting and increase morbidity in older adults . Unfortunately , low fitness levels and poor compliance limit the mitigating influence of weight loss through exercise training on sarcopenic obesity . In order to address anabolic resistance or the decreased ability to maintain protein synthesis that contributes to sarcopenic obesity , the investigators have developed a complete meal replacement that contains a mechanism-targeted profile of essential amino acids ( 17 grams ) . This profile is designed to overcome anabolic resistance and maintain net protein balance even in the hypocaloric state . It is our overarching hypothesis that EMR will promote the retention of lean tissue mass , and improve metabolic and functional outcomes following 12 weeks of CRWL , and that those endpoints will be sustained over a 12 week maintenance period with the once per day ( q.d . ) consumption of EMR . The investigators will randomly assign older obese individuals to either EMR or an isocaloric serving of Bariatrics Advantage ( meal replacement that contains 27 grams of intact protein ) during these interventions . The investigators will execute these specific aims to test our hypotheses : SA1 . Establish the importance of EMR in the preservation of lean tissue mass during CRWL . Lean tissue mass and adipose tissue mass will be determined by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) and magnetic resonance imaging/spectroscopy ( MRI/MRS ) scans . MRI/MRS will be used to measure intrahepatic lipid , and the investigators will evaluate alterations in insulin sensitivity using the HOMA score . The investigators will measure potential changes in gut microbiota in collaboration with Dr. Duddleston at the University of Alaska Anchorage . SA2 . Determine the influence of EMR on physical function and increased daily activity during CRWL . Slow walking speed is a strong predictor of morbidity and mortality . The investigators chose the 6-minute walk test to represent the primary endpoint for this aim . The investigators will also determine alterations in gait speed , skeletal muscle power and strength and stair climbing ability , and changes in physical activity using Actigraph GT3X+ devices . SA3 . Identify whether EMR q.d . will sustain improvements in body composition , physical function and metabolic parameters over a 12 week , maintenance period following CRWL . Since the preservation of lean tissue mass is directly linked to optimal function and metabolic health , the investigators will measure the influence of EMR q.d . on the indices of metabolic health ( ie. , intrahepatic lipid , insulin sensitivity ) and physical function .",2020-02-05,"April 7, 2022",Inclusion Criteria : 60-80 years of age Body mass index of 30-40 kg/m2 Participants must be capable of understanding the consent process Participants must be capable of signing the consent form Participants must have access to transportation to the clinic site Exclusion Criteria : Creatinine > 1.6 Serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase > 2 times normal Resting blood pressure above 160/90 mmHg Use of Gemfibrozil Use of corticosteroids Previously diagnosed diabetes ( fasting blood glucose ≥ 126 mg/dl ) History of kidney or liver disease Heart disease as indicated by interventional procedures Recent history of alcoholism Physical or neurological disorder that would prevent them from completing the functional tests Lactose intolerance Active cancer within the last two years Chronic inflammatory conditions that preclude completion of functional tests,6,0,60 Years,80 Years

LID leads to reduced quality of life , increased caregiver burden and an increased risk of falls ( Rascol et al. , 2015 , Chapuis et al. , 2005 ) . GOCOVRI™ is an extended release capsule prescription medication shown to reduce LID in people with PD ( Pahwa et al. , 2017 , Pahwa et al. , 2018 ) . However , a number of studies have identified an increase in falls in those on the active medication study arm but not the placebo arm ( 13 % increase in active and 7 % in placebo ) ( Pahwa et al. , 2017 ) . In order to understand this increase in falls , comprehensive measurements of quantity of activity ( gait measured in the home environment ) and quality of activity ( comprehensive gait characteristics that may increase risk of falls ) need to be assessed in participants taking GOCOVRI™ . In addition , the evidence for the effect of GOCOVRI™ on gait and balance in PD is limited ( Smulders et al. , 2016 ) . This study is an open label study in which the following Aims will be studied : Aim I : Investigate the effect of GOCOVRI™ on activity levels in people with Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) and Levodopa induced dyskinesia ( LID ) Hypothesis I : We hypothesize that GOCOVRI™ will result in an increase of daily activity due to improvement in LID symptoms .

Aristotle University Of Thessaloniki,NCT04391855,"Wound Infiltration With Tramadol, Dexmedetomidine, or Magnesium Plus Ropivacaine for Pain Relief After Spine Surgery",Aristotle University Of Thessaloniki,4,1,Analgesia,Drug,Tramadol with ropivacaine,Treatment,Triple,"The rationale for multimodal analgesia is to achieve additive or synergistic analgesic properties while decreasing the incidence of side effects by reducing the dose of each agent . Nociceptive stimuli are known to activate the release of the excitatory amino acid glutamate in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord . The resultant activation of NMDA receptors causes calcium entry into the cell and triggers central sensitization . This mechanism is involved in the perception of pain and mainly accounts for its persistence during the postoperative period . Peri-incisional injection of local anesthetics is an effective method for pain relief after many surgical procedures , as it can reduce postoperative analgesic consumption . Ropivacaine is a propyl analog of bupivacaine with a longer duration of action with a much safer cardiotoxicity profile than bupivacaine . Thus , a combination of local anesthetic with other analgesic factors , such as opioids , dexmedetomidine , clonidine , ketamine , magnesium sulfate , dexamethasone is suggested for a better analgesic outcome . Dexmedetomidine , a highly selective a2-adrenergic receptor agonist , has been the focus of interest for its broad spectrum ( sedative , analgesic , and anesthetic sparing ) properties , making it a useful and safe adjunct in many clinical applications . The intravenous , intramuscular , intrathecal , epidural , and perineural use of this agent enhances analgesic effects . Tramadol hydrochloride is a synthetic analog of codeine that acts on both opioid ( weak m receptor agonist ) and nonopioid receptors ( inhibits the reuptake of noradrenaline and serotonin as well as release stored serotonin from nerve endings ) which play a crucial role in pain inhibition pathway . It also blocks nerve conduction which imparts its local anesthetics like action on peripheral nerves . It was reported that NMDA antagonists could prolong the analgesic effect of bupivacaine to even a week , as well as inhibit hyperalgesia . Magnesium sulfate ( MGS ) is a non-competitive antagonist of N-methyl , D-aspartate ( NMDA ) receptors with an analgesic effect and is essential for the release of acetylcholine from the presynaptic terminals and , similar to calcium channel blockers ( CCB ) , can prevent the entry of calcium into the cell . Aim of the study is to evaluate and compare the postoperative analgesic efficacy of tramadol , dexmedetomidine , and magnesium when added to ropivacaine as an adjuvant for wound infiltration following spine surgery .","Each participant will receive standard monitoring ( ECG , SpO2 , capnography , SBP , oesophageal temperature ) and intravenous access will be established . A standard anesthesia protocol will be applied involving propofol 2mg/kg ( iv ) and remifentanil in TCI ( target-controlled infusion ) . Cis-atracurium 0.2 mg/kg ( iv ) will be given to facilitate endotracheal intubation . Anesthesia will be maintained with desflurane in a 50 % air/O2 mixture A standard anesthesia protocol will be applied involving propofol 2mg/kg ( iv ) and remifentanil in TCI ( target-controlled infusion ) .

Remifentanil target level will be titrated according to analgesic demands defined by a > 20 % change of heart rate or blood pressure compared with baseline . The duration of both anesthesia and surgical procedure will be registered . Furthermore , the level of sedation upon anesthesia emergence will be recorded using the Ramsey sedation scale . Postoperatively pain assessment will be performed by the Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) and Numerical Rating Scale ( NRS ) at anesthesia emergence and at 2 , 4 , 6 , 12 , 18 , and 24 h after surgery conclusion .

Currently approved smoking cessation medications act on nicotinic receptors , and additional work is needed to identify medications with alternate pharmacological targets . Based on evidence that the serotonin system plays a role in nicotine consumption and relapse , this study will examine whether a selective serotonin medication alters smoking-related behaviors and responses to cigarette smoking under controlled conditions , informing its potential utility for smoking cessation .","Tobacco use remains the foremost cause of preventable deaths in the U.S. and worldwide . Advancing new smoking cessation therapies , including those with novel pharmacological targets , is a critical public health priority . The serotonin ( 5-hydroxtytryptamine ; 5-HT ) system is broadly implicated in the regulation of reward- related behavior , including drug seeking , in part reflecting its modulatory role in dopamine ( DA ) function . Recent studies show that targeted manipulation of the serotonin 5-HT2C receptor alters drug-related behavior ; in particular , 5-HT2C receptor agonists are shown to reduce nicotine intake and reinstatement . Of the selective 5-HT2C receptor agonists , lorcaserin has the best near-term potential for repurposing as a smoking cessation therapy , having been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for weight management . Preclinical findings implicate several potential behavioral mechanisms by which 5-HT2C receptor agonists might reduce drug intake , including drug-specific processes ( e.g. , incentive salience of drug cues , self-administration , reinstatement ) and drug-nonspecific behaviors ( e.g. , reductions in impulsivity ) . To date , potential mechanisms of 5-HT2C receptor agonists have not been characterized in human studies . Given emerging interest in lorcaserin as a novel smoking cessation therapy , further studies are needed to evaluate its efficacy profile , including studies to evaluate candidate treatment mechanisms . This human laboratory investigation will examine the effects of lorcaserin vs. placebo on relapse-related outcomes using a double-blind , within-subjects , crossover design . Impulsivity subdomains will also be examined as candidate mechanisms for medication effects .

Centenario Hospital Miguel Hidalgo,NCT04391127,Hydroxychloroquine and Ivermectin for the Treatment of COVID-19 Infection,Centenario Hospital Miguel Hidalgo,3,1,COVID-19,Drug,Hydroxychloroquine,Treatment,Double,"Background : In December 2019 , patients with pneumonia secondary to a new subtype of Coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) were identified in China . In a few weeks the virus spread and cases started practically all over the world . In February 2020 , the WHO declared a pandemic . Severe symptoms have been found in patients mainly with comorbidities and over 50 years of age . At this time there is no proven therapeutic alternative . In vitro studies and observational experiences showed that antimalarial drugs ( Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine ) had antiviral activity and increased viral clearance . Ivermectin , on the other hand , has been shown in vitro to reduce viral replication and in an observational cohort , greater viral clearance with promising clinical results . So far there is no standard of treatment and clinical trials are needed to find effective treatment alternatives . Objective : To evaluate the safety and efficacy of treatment with hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin for serious COVID-19 infections in no critical hospitalized patients . Material and methods : Randomized controlled trial of patients diagnosed with respiratory infection by COVID-19 , who present criteria for hospitalization . Randomization will be performed to receive hydroxychloroquine at a dose of 400 mg every 12 hours for one day and then 200 mg every 12 hours , to complete a 5-day treatment schedule . Group 2 : Ivermectin 12 mg every 24 hours for one day ( less than 80 kg ) or Ivermectin 18 mg every 24 hours for one day ( greater than 80 kg ) + placebo until the fifth day . Group 3 : Placebo . Prior to randomization , the risk of cardiovascular complications determined by corrected QT interval , related to hydroxychloroquine intake will be assessed . If the patient is at high risk , the allocation will be to ivermectin only or to placebo in an independent randomization , if the risk is low , any of the three groups could be assigned . Outcomes : The primary outcome will be discharge from hospital for improvement . The safety outcomes will be requirement of mechanical intubation , septic shock or death . Viral clearance will also be evaluated by means of PCR , which will be taken on the 5th day after admission , day 14 and 21 .","Background In late December 2019 , the health authorities of the People 's Republic of China reported several cases of pneumonia of unknown origin in Wuhan City , Hubei Province , China . On December 31 , 2019 , the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention began etiological and epidemiological research on this disease . Three samples of bronchoalveolar lavage were taken from patients from the Jinyintan hospital in Wuhan and through various processes they came to identify a new coronavirus that they initially called on January 7 , 2020 as : 2019-nCoV . On January 2020 , the World Health Organization ( WHO ) made the first recommendations on the epidemiological surveillance of this new coronavirus . On January 22 , 2020 , the first session of the Emergencies Committee was convened by WHO in Geneva , Switzerland and on January 30 Public Health Emergency of International Importance ( ESPII ) was declared to the 2019 outbreak . On February 11 , the International Committee on Virus Taxonomy made up of experts , based on the biology , species and type of virus isolated , names this new coronavirus as SARS-CoV-2 and responds to `` Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 `` ( Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 for its acronym in English ) , the WHO proposes that same day to call the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 as COVID-19 . The first case reported in Latin America was in Brazil on February 26 and on the 28th of the same month , Mexico communicates its first confirmed case of the new coronavirus in a 35-year-old patient from a trip to Italy . Given the alarming levels of spread and severity of COVID-19 , at a press conference on March 11 , 2020 , WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus declares the SARS-CoV-2.5 outbreak as a pandemic . IVERMECTIN The SARS-CoV-2 viral genome was rapidly sequenced to allow for a diagnostic test , epidemiological follow-up , and the development of preventive and therapeutic strategies , however , to date there is no evidence from clinical trials for any therapy that improves the evolution of patients suspected or confirmed with COVID-19 . New potential candidates for the treatment of this disease have emerged . A preclinical study showed that ivermectin , an FDA-approved antiparasitic drug , reduces the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro . Ivermectin is a broad-spectrum antiparasitic that has shown antiviral activity against a broad group of viruses in recent years . It has been shown to inhibit the import of HIV viral integrase into the nucleus of human cells and also replication of the virus . It does something similar with other proteins of the SV40 virus and the dengue virus . It has also been shown to limit the infection of RNA viruses such as dengue , West Nile virus , Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus , and influenza virus . It has also been shown to be effective against DNA viruses such as pseudorabies of the mice . On the other hand , it has not been shown to be effective against the zika virus in mice , although this should be re-evaluated . Studies on the SARS-CoV-1 coronavirus have revealed that the alpha/beta1 importin of the virus plays a role in infection in relation to intracellular signals of the capsid protein , which may have an impact on the division of host cells . Studies in cultures of infected cells show that ivermectin has a potent antiviral effect against SARS-CoV-2 and opens up hopeful expectations for using this antiparasitic in the early treatment of COVID-19 which is likely to help reduce the viral load , prevent progression to severe phase and limit person-to-person transmission . Therefore , the development of clinical protocols comparing it with other antivirals with alternate mechanisms of action is important and should be established as soon as possible . In the study by Patel et al. , Ivermectin was evaluated in a cohort of patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation . In the ivermectin group , they were admitted to a dose of 150mcg/kg once they were intubated and observed a significant reduction in mortality , as well as significant reductions in the length of hospitalization and days in the intensive care unit . Hydroxychloroquine Antimalarial drugs such as chloroquine ( CQ ) and hydroxychloroquine ( HCQ ) have been used for more than a century . They have been used not only for malaria but also in rheumatic conditions due to their anti-inflammatory properties and good safety profile . That is why , in the midst of a pandemic , the question of the use of antimalarials in the treatment and prophylaxis of covid-19 has been raised . Kayaerts et al . demonstrated the inhibition of SARS-CoV by chloroquine in Vero E6 cells at different post-infection times . Vincent et al . demonstrated the dose-dependent inhibition effect of the virus on Vero E6 cells immediately after viral absorption and also 3 to 5 hours later . They also demonstrated that the cells pre-treated with CQ were refractory to the virus in addition to improving terminal glycosylation of the ACE2 receptor , decreasing the viral affinity for the receptor and also reducing the onset of infection . The above illustrates the possibility of using HCQ for prophylaxis or treatment against SARS-CoV . Due to the similarities of SARS-CoV-2 with the SARS virus , several studies have proposed the use of HCQ and CQ for management of the current pandemic . Wang et al . tested the in vitro effect of several antivirals approved by the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) of the United States of America . Remdesivir showed blocking of viral infection after virus entry with an Effective Concentration of 50 % ( EC50 ) of 0.77 μM and a cytotoxic concentration of 50 % ( CC50 ) greater than 100μM . Chloroquine had an EC50 = 1.13μM , and a CC50 greater than 100μM and an EC90 of 6.9μM . Chloroquine was effective at the viral entry and post-entry level , while remdesivir was only effective at the post-entry level . The above suggests a possible use of CQ as a prophylactic for SARS-CoV-2.19 infection . Yao et al . Also tested the effect of HCQ and CQ in vitro . They tested the pharmacological activity of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine using Vero cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 . Physiology-based pharmacokinetic models ( PBPK ) were implemented for both drugs separately integrating their in vitro data . Using PBPK models , hydroxychloroquine concentrations in the lung fluid were simulated under 5 different dosing regimens to explore the most effective regimen while considering the safety profile of the drug . In this study , it was found that HCQ ( EC50 = 0.72 μM ) is more potent than chloroquine ( EC50 = 5.47 μM ) in vitro . Based on the results of the PBPK models , a loading dose of 400 mg twice daily of orally administered hydroxychloroquine sulfate is recommended , followed by a maintenance dose of 200 mg twice daily for 4 days for infection by SARS-CoV-2 , since it reached three times the potency of CQ phosphate when administered 500 mg twice a day 5 days in advance . Gao et al . demonstrated the superiority of CQ over control treatment in more than 100 patients with respect to inhibition of exacerbation of pneumonia , improvement in lung imaging findings , promoting negative virus conversion and shortening the course of disease in more than 10 hospitals in China . Gautret et al . treated 20 patients with hydroxychloroquine and compared the results with 16 controls in France . They used PCR to measure viral load on days 3 , 4 , 5 , and 6 post-inclusion . The treatment group had a higher mean age , but no gender difference was made between the two groups . Asymptomatic patients and patients with upper and lower respiratory tract infections were treated . They concluded that HCQ was effective in reducing viral load . The results on day 3 indicated that 50 % of the patients treated with HCQ had a reduction in viral load ( p = 0.005 ) , on day 4 it showed a 60 % reduction ( p = 0.04 ) on day 5 , a 65 % reduction ( p= 0.006 ) and on day 6 , 70 % of the patients showed a reduction in the viral load ( p= 0.001 ) . Furthermore , they described the synergistic effect of azithromycin when used in conjunction with HCQ to decrease viral load . Dual treatment showed a 100 % decrease in viral load ( p < 0.001 ) for day 6 , while hydroxychloroquine alone showed a 70 % decrease . In the recently published recommendations of the American Society for Infectious Diseases ( IDSA ) on April 11 , 2020 , it is established that in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 , the use of HCQ / CQ should only be given in the context of a clinical trial . The best evidence currently available has failed to demonstrate or exclude a beneficial effect of HCQ on the clinical progression of COVID-19 , as inferred by radiological findings , or on viral clearance by means of PCR tests , although a somewhat higher proportion in the HCQ group experienced clinical improvement ( RR : 1.47 ; 95 % CI 1.02 - 2.11 , p=0.04 ) . However , the certainty in the evidence was rated as very low mainly due to small sample sizes , co-interventions , and risk of bias due to methodological limitations . Furthermore , the selected results should be considered indirect , since significant patient outcomes ( eg , mortality , rate of progression to ARDS , and need for mechanical ventilation ) were not available . Studies evaluating the addition of azithromycin ( AZ ) to HCQ provided indirect comparisons of failure of virological clearance with historical controls . The observed risk of mortality among patients who received HCQ + AZ during the hospitalization was 3.4 % ( 6/175 patients ) . However , an estimated mortality rate in an untreated cohort was not provided in the manuscript . Compared to the lack of viral clearance in historical controls ( 100 % virological failure ) , 12 symptomatic patients were compared on day 5 or 6 of a separate hospital in France . Patients who received HCQ + AZ treatment experienced numerically fewer cases of virologic failure ( 43 % combined virologic failure ; 29/71 patients ) . There is very low certainty in this comparison of treatment effect , mainly due to very high risk selection bias , making any claims of effectiveness highly uncertain . Furthermore , relying on intermediate outcomes , such as viral clearance to determine important outcomes for the patient ( including a reduction in the development of pneumonia , hospital or ICU admission , or the need for intubation ) adds another layer of imprecision . Finally , Barbosa et al conducted a comparative study of hospitalized adults with viral pneumonia secondary to SARS-CoV-2 during the last two weeks of March 2020 . A group receiving HCQ and support measures against another group that only received support measures . The primary endpoints were the effect of hydroxychloroquine use on the need to increase respiratory support , change in lymphocyte count , and change in neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio . In this study , of 63 included patients , 32 were assigned to the HCQ arm . The administration of HCQ was associated with the need to increase the degree of ventilatory support compared to those who did not receive HCQ for 5 days ( p = 0.013 ) . The change in total lymphocytes in the HCQ group was not different from that in the group that only received support measures . These authors concluded that the use of HCQ tends to worsen the neutrophil / lymphocyte ratio compared to the group that only received supportive measures , in addition to the fact that the use of HCQ was found to increase the risk that the patient required ventilatory management with intubation . Definition of the problem Due to the high rate of spread of COVID-19 infection , associated with a high rate of hospitalization due to respiratory failure , empirical treatment of active agents in vitro has become a common practice . Hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin have demonstrated viral inhibition in vitro and observational experiences have proposed them as potentially safe alternatives with clinical efficacy . The proposed treatments have an adequate margin of safety , in addition to the fact that we have extensive clinical experience because they were previously used in humans to treat malaria , rheumatologic diseases , or parasitosis . Due to this , in conjunction with the urgent need to seek therapeutic alternatives , controlled studies are required without assuming efficacy . Justification COVID-19 infection has collapsed health systems in industrialized countries due to the large number of patients requiring respiratory assistance . There is no standard treatment for the management of this infection and the focus has been on the already known life support and management of Adult Respiratory Failure Syndrome in critically ill patients . The treatments used empirically have an adequate safety profile due to the experience in other clinical settings . The use of these empirical alternatives should be based on clinical trials since efficacy and safety should not be assumed in the group of patients with COVID-19 . The Miguel Hidalgo Centennial Hospital has been assigned as a hospitalization center for COVID-19 patients in Aguascalientes Mexico . Hypothesis Treatment with hydroxychloroquine or Ivermectin will be superior to placebo , with a shorter hospital stay and a lower rate of complications ( intubation , septic shock , or death ) .",2020-05-12,"November 6, 2020",Inclusion Criteria : RT-qPCR SARS-CoV-2 positivity or chest computed Tomography with suspected COVID-19 pneumonia Hospitalization by medical emergency staff criteria Exclusion Criteria : Other confirmed viral active and acute infection,108,0,16 Years,90 Years
The Mind Research Network,NCT04396847,Laboratory Screening of Lorcaserin for Alcohol Use Disorder,The Mind Research Network,2,0,Alcohol Use Disorder,Drug,Lorcaserin Oral Tablet,Basic Science,Quadruple,"Heavy-drinking smokers , including those with alcohol use disorder ( AUD ) , are at increased risk for numerous negative health outcomes relative to those who use alcohol or cigarettes only . Although heavy-drinking smokers are recognized as an important subgroup for clinical and public health interventions , there are presently no approved medications for the joint indication of alcohol reduction and smoking cessation . Based on evidence that the serotonin system plays a role in alcohol and nicotine consumption and relapse , this study aims to examine whether a serotonin medication alters alcohol and nicotine responses in smokers with AUD , informing its potential utility as a candidate therapy for this clinical subgroup .","Pharmacotherapy development remains a critical objective for reducing health and societal burdens associated with alcohol use disorder ( AUD ) . Developing targeted treatments for specific AUD subgroups is a key objective . Among those with AUD , cigarette smokers comprise a sizable and critical subgroup with disproportionally high long-term health risks , making it a key priority to advance therapies for concurrent AUD and cigarette smoking . The serotonin ( 5-hydroxtytryptamine ; 5-HT ) system is broadly implicated in addictive behaviors , in part reflecting the role of 5-HT in modulating dopamine function . Preclinical studies of 5-HT receptor drugs have shown that targeted modulation of the 5-HT2C receptor ( implicated in 5-HT-related inhibition of DA function ) alters the consumption and reinstatement of addictive drugs , including alcohol and nicotine . Of the selective 5-HT2C receptor agonists , lorcaserin has superior near-term potential for repurposing as an AUD therapy , having been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for weight management . Human laboratory medication trials offer a time- and cost-effective option for validating preclinical findings prior to larger randomized controlled trials , and for testing candidate treatment mechanisms . This Phase II human laboratory screening trial will evaluate lorcaserin as a novel candidate therapy for smokers with AUD . Effects of lorcaserin vs. placebo will be evaluated in a double-blind , within-subjects , crossover study with human laboratory endpoints . This study will provide early human data on the effects of a 5-HT2C receptor agonist in relation to alcohol-related outcomes , informing its potential for further evaluation as a candidate treatment for AUD .",2020-02-03,"August 16, 2022","Inclusion Criteria : Age 21-65 Meeting DSM-5 criteria for current ( past year ) AUD , as well as current at-risk drinking ( i.e. , ≥14/21 drinks per week for women/men , on average ) , with at least four episodes of 4+/5+ drinks in the past 30 days Daily smoker , defined as reporting smoking 1+ cigarettes per day , on average , over the past 12 months Willingness to take study pills and complete study procedures Willingness to complete lab sessions involving alcohol administration Exclusion Criteria : Recent ( 30 day ) illicit drug use ( with the exception of cannabis ) based on self-report or toxicology screen Meeting DSM-5 criteria for a past-year substance use disorder other than alcohol use disorder , tobacco use disorder , or mild cannabis use disorder Significant alcohol withdrawal , based on a Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol-revised ( CIWA-Ar ) score of 8+ at baseline medical visit , or any reported history of severe withdrawal symptoms ( e.g. , seizures ) Past 30-day use of nicotine replacement Past 30-day use of SSRIs , other psychiatric medications , or weight control medications Lifetime diagnosis of severe mental illness ( e.g. , psychotic or bipolar I disorder ) Significant medical or neurological illness based on medical staff ( i.e. , physician or nurse practitioner ) evaluation including severe hepatic impairment or cirrhosis , insulin dependent diabetes Current alcohol or smoking cessation treatment or efforts to cut down on drinking/smoking Medications contraindicated for use with lorcaserin or which have a significant interaction with lorcaserin Body mass index ( BMI ) under normal range ( < 18kg/m2 ) History of significant cardiovascular conditions including history of arrhythmias or heart block , heart failure , valvular heart disease , heat attack , stroke , unstable angina Abnormal electrocardiogram ( ECG ) results Currently nursing , pregnant , or anticipating pregnancy history of suicide attempt or recent suicidal ideation ( i.e. , Suicidal thoughts ( intent or plan ) in the last month ) Plans to travel outside of the local area during the study period , or inability to commit to entire duration of study",5,0,21 Years,65 Years

Johns Hopkins University,NCT04498468,Safety and Efficacy of Dexamethasone Ophthalmic Insert (Dextenza®) in the Management of Clinically Significant Dry Eye,Johns Hopkins University,4,0,Dry Eye,Drug,"Sustained Release Dexamethasone, 0.4 mg",Treatment,Double,To determine efficacy and safety profile of dexamethasone 0.4mg lacrimal insert in dry eye related ocular surface inflammation .,"Previous studies showed that dexamethasone and loteprednol topical drops have led to favorable results . However , the requirement of frequent instillation of drops by the patients is problematic causing discomfort and blurring of vision and requires remembering and dexterity for instillation , poor compliance is not uncommon . In addition Investigators believe that instillation of drops disturbs the homeostasis of the natural tear film due to physical and chemical trauma due to large drop volume ( 50 microliters ) hammering on the eye surface ( which can only hold 7 to 10 microliters ) . Particularly washing away of the mucin layer that holds all the `` good ingredients '' in the tears is harmful to the ocular surface . Therefore , `` dropless '' treatment of dry eye is desirable . Dextenza® ( dexamethasone ophthalmic insert , Ocular Therapeutix Inc. , Bedford , MA ) is a corticosteroid intracanalicular insert approved by US-FDA in November 2018 for the treatment of post-surgical ocular inflammation and pain . It is inserted into the lower lacrimal punctum and into the canaliculus . A single insert releases a 0.4 mg dose of dexamethasone for up to 30 days following insertion . Dextenza® is resorbable and does not require removal . Investigators hypothesize that Dextenza® could mimic short-term topical steroid use in a tapering manner in patients with clinically significant dry eye and show efficacy in improving its symptoms and signs , as was previously shown with other steroid preparations . If proven , the use of Dextenza® may shift paradigms in the management of the clinically significant ocular surface disease .

Herlev Hospital,NCT04492553,Gonadal Dysfunction in Male Long-term Survivors of Malignant Lymphoma; Vitality,Lars Møller Pedersen,2,1,Hypogonadism,Drug,AndroGel,Treatment,,"This study is a prospective non-randomised open label multicenter phase two study in male long-term survivors of malignant lymphoma including Hodgkin Lymphoma ( HL ) and Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma ( DLBCL ) . The study aims to assess whether low levels of testosterone in the blood of patients cured for aggressive lymphoma , can be effectively treated with Testosterone gel , and if treatment with testosterone can improve their general quality of life . The investigators hypothesize that patients will develop sexual dysfunction and poor quality of life when suffering from untreated reduced level of testosterone . Cancer treatment is increasingly effective and the overall survival higher , which makes issues like sexuality and long-term quality of life more and more important to address in cured cancer patients . Patient sexuality and quality of life is measured by three questionnaires , and serum testosterone level , during one year of treatment with Testogel . The intention is to show that future follow-up visits should include focus on sexuality and serum testosterone , so relevant patients can be identified and treated for their hormonedeficiency without delay . The expected follow-up program include questionnaires and blood samples , which are easily implemented and without great cost .","Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and Hodgkin Lymphoma are two aggressive lymphomas often treated with doxorubicin containing chemotherapy . Doxorubicin is an anthracycline and is known to be toxic to both Leydig Cells of the testes and hormone-producing cells of the hypothalamus . Therefore , patients treated with this drug are at risk of developing hypogonadism . Standard follow-up programs do not include analysis of hormone levels or treatment of hypogonadism . With this study the aim is to investigate the effect and toxicity of treatment with exogenous testosterone in male long-term survivors of malignant lymphoma , to clarify whether it is relevant to include serum testosterone and potentially testosterone replacement therapy in standard follow-up programs . Our Hypothesis : Hypothesis 1 : A significant proportion of long-term male survivors of HL and DLBCL have impaired quality of life ( QoL ) due to sexual dysfunction . Hypothesis 2 : A significant proportion of long-term male survivors of HL and DLBCL have reduced levels of testosterone . Hypothesis 3 : A significant relationship between QoL , sexual dysfunction and testosterone levels exists . Hypothesis 4 : Substitution with testosterone in carefully selected subgroups will improve sexual function and QoL . Hypothesis 5 : Treatment with testosterone in this setting is safe with acceptable toxicity . To assess efficacy and safety of treatment with testosterone replacement therapy on hypogonadism in lymphoma patients , blood tests and questionnaires are completed throughout one year of treatment .

Universidade Federal de Alfenas,NCT04495374,Oral Pregabalin as Preemptive Analgesia in Abdominal Hysterectomy,Universidade Federal de Alfenas,4,0,"Pain, Postoperative",Drug,Pregabalin 300mg,Prevention,Triple,"Postoperative pain affects 80 % of surgical patients and is one of the main negative symptoms resulting from surgery . It impairs the recovery of patient since it is related to chronic pain , nausea and vomiting and longer hospital stay , generating higher cost to the health system . Thus , the use of new methods to control postoperative pain is recommended and multimodal analgesia , an opioid-sparing strategies , has been widely used by several researchers . Studies show that gabapentins have beneficial effects on postoperative pain control when used as pre-anesthetic medication , also showing a reduction in opioid consumption , with few adverse effects . Among gynecological surgeries , abdominal hysterectomy is one of the procedures that generates the highest degree of acute postoperative pain . Thus , the aim of the present study is to investigate the effect of oral pregabalin ( 300 mg ) two hours before abdominal hysterectomy procedures on postoperative pain . This study is a randomized , double-blind , placebo controlled clinical trial . Patients submitted to abdominal hysterectomy for benign pathologies will be selected and divided into two groups : the placebo controlled group ( P0 ) and the pregabalin 300 mg group ( P1 ) . Group P0 will receive a placebo tablet one hour before the procedure , while group P1 will receive a 300 mg tablet of pregabalin identical to the placebo tablet . The reduction of postoperative pain and the best quality of patient recovery will be evaluated using the Visual Analogue Pain Scale ( VAS ) and the McGill Pain Questionnaire . Also , it will be evaluated the consumption of opioids as a rescue analgesic medication and the presence of adverse effects such as nausea and vomiting .","The sample population of this study is 102 female patients ( 50 already included in the study ) , who have undergone abdominal hysterectomy surgery for benign conditions , with or without joint oophorectomy / salpingectomy . The patients received spinal anesthesia , at hospital `` Santa Casa de Alfenas '' - Minas Gerais / Brazil ( `` Casa de Caridade Nossa Senhora do Perpétuo Socorro '' ) . All surgeries were performed by the same team of surgeons . All patients were evaluated and followed from the preoperative period , up to 24 hours postoperatively , passing through the intraoperative period . During all stages , patients were assisted by a properly trained multi-professional team , consisting of a doctor , nurse and nursing technician . For the patient to be included in the study , she must have understood and agreed with the informed consent form that was explained in detail to all possible candidates in the preoperative period . This is a double blind randomized study . The patients were randomly allocated to 02 groups , in which Group 1 received medication A ( designated in the study as medication 1 ) , whereas Group 2 received medication B ( designated in the study as medication 2 ) . Study participants and researchers were blinded as to the use of drug / placebo to avoid measurement bias . To carry out the blinding process , an external researcher was assigned to randomize the groups and prepare the pills in opaque and closed envelopes characterized only by a control identification ( A or B ) , which is known only to this researcher . Patients in both groups received identical sealed envelopes , 02h before the start of the anesthetic procedure , only identified as medication A or B , which contained two pills in each envelope . A second researcher is responsible for collecting data and monitoring the patient from the intraoperative period up to 24 hours after discharge from the post-anesthetic recovery room ( PARR ) . In the operating room , venoclysis was performed with jelco No . 18 or No . 20 , and an infusion of 08 ml.kg-1 of crystalloid solution ( lactated ringer ) . The patients were properly monitored with pulse oximetry , cardioscope , and non-invasive blood pressure monitor . After monitoring , patients were premedicated with intravenous ( IV ) midazolam at a dosage of 0.03 mg.kg1 . To perform spinal anesthesia , the patients were seated on the surgical stretcher by the nursing team . Asepsis and antisepsis were performed at the puncture site with alcoholic chlorhexidine solution . After placement of sterile drapes , local anesthesia was performed with 2.0 % lidocaine without vasoconstrictor . The first attempt at subarachnoid puncture was performed , using the median technique , between the intervertebral levels L3-L4 or L4-L5 or L5-S1 , with a 25 gauge Quincke needle for subarachnoid anesthesia . If there was a technical difficulty in the puncture , the paramedian puncture technique was chosen . The confirmation of the correct puncture was based on the aspiration of cerebrospinal fluid . Anesthesia was performed with the local anesthetic 0.5 % bupivacaine at a dosage of 0.3 mg.kg-1 , injected from a 5 ml disposable syringe . After anesthesia , the patients were placed in the supine position , and the correct level of anesthesia was proven with thermal sensitivity tests using cotton soaked with alcoholic solution . After the anesthesia reached the sensory level of the T4 thoracic vertebra , the surgical team was allowed to start the procedure . Prior to the beginning of the surgical incision , a delayed bladder probe was performed in all patients according to the surgeon 's indication . Hemodynamic changes in blood pressure were controlled with the use of vasoactive medications such as ephedrine or metaraminol . For prophylaxis of postoperative nausea and vomiting ( PONV ) ondansetron was administered at a dosage of 4 mg intravenously ( IV ) 30 minutes before the end of surgery . Tenoxicam was prescribed for all patients at a dosage of 20 mg IV at regular intervals every 12 hours for the purpose of anti-inflammatory and analgesic action . For analgesic relief , dipyrone IV was also prescribed at a dosage of 50 mg.kg-1 at regular intervals every 6 hours . During the surgery , and also at the end of the surgery , the patients were evaluated for the degree of sedation using the Ramsay sedation scale as a basis . At the end of the surgery , the patients were referred to the post-anaesthesia care unit , where they were monitored again , and went through the pain assessment process using the visual analog scale ( VAS ) in relation to pain at rest and `` movement '' ( the patient was asked to perform the forced cough movement ) , through a direct question with scale demonstration . Pains characterized as mild ( 0 - 2 VAS ) received no medication other than those already prescribed ; pain characterized as moderate ( 3 - 7 EVA ) received IV morphine at a dosage of 0.025 mg.kg-1 ; and severe pain ( 8 - 10 VAS ) received IV morphine at a dose of 0.05 mg.kg-1 every 01 h until analgesic control . To consider themselves able to be discharged from the post-anaesthesia care unit for clinical follow-up in wards , patients should reach a score ≥ 9 on the modified Aldrete Scale and have VAS pain scores ≤ 2 . In the infirmary , patients were tested at regular intervals for pain intensity , by of a team of nurses trained and qualified to do so . The patients had pain classified as moderate ( VAS ≥ 2 < 8 ) or severe ( VAS ≥ 8 ) , receiving drugs with morphine IV in the dose of 1 mg and 2 mg respectively , according to the medical prescription . 24 h after discharge from the post-anaesthesia care unit , in the ward , all the patient was assessed by the same examiner who performed an assessment at the post-anaesthesia care unit , who stratified the patient again from the EVA and assessed using the McGill questionnaire . During the entire hospitalization period , the use of central nervous system ( CNS ) depressant drugs ( example : ketamine , droperidol , promethazine ) and / or analgesic drugs that do not contain any study protocol was avoided . If some patients were medicated with these drugs , they were excluded from the study . The data related to surgery ( pre , trans and postoperative ) were collected for statistical analysis , according to Annex II , in which a total duration of surgery in minutes ; the total intravenous medication infused ; the values of mean arterial pressure and heart rate in the pre , intra and postoperative period ; a presence or not , as well as a quantity , of PONV in the post-anaesthesia care unit and after 24h ; presence or not of dizziness as a possible side effect ; among others .

"University of Mississippi, Oxford",NCT04490239,Intranasal Heparin Tolerability Study,Joshua Sharp,0,1,Covid19,Drug,Intranasal heparin sodium (porcine),Prevention,,"The investigators are investigating the tolerability of Heparin Sodium ( porcine ) administered topically via a nasal spray . This agent is being investigated as a potential prophylactic treatment to prevent infection by SARS ( severe acute respiratory syndrome ) -CoV-2 , the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 . Heparin Sodium ( porcine ) is an FDA-approved anticoagulant drug administered by injection . Recent work from multiple groups have found that heparin can prevent the infection of cells by SARS-CoV-2 , indicating a possible use as a topical anti-viral . Numerous studies in both rodent models and humans have shown that heparin administered via a pulmonary or intranasal route enters the blood stream in negligible amounts , suggesting intranasal administration of heparin should be safe even at very large doses . Data from mouse models indicate that repeated daily nasal administration of heparin had no adverse effects in mice over a two week period ( including weight loss , nose bleeds , loss of sense of smell , nasal discharge , or decreased blood clotting time ) . However , no data of repeated nasal administration of heparin in humans is available . The investigators will test nasal administration of FDA-approved heparin sodium ( porcine ) , originally formulated for injection . The formulations the investigators will be testing consist of heparin , sodium chloride , and 1 % benzyl alcohol as a preservative bottled in a nasal sprayer dispensing 0.1 mL ( millilitres ) per spray . The investigation is planned in two phases . A single-dose phase will test the acute tolerability of the drug . In this phase , subjects will be administered 0.1 mL of Heparin Sodium in each nostril formulated at one of two doses : Day 1 will test a formulation of 5000 U ( units ) /mL , and Day 2 will test a formulation of 10000 U ( units ) /mL . After each dose , subjects will be tested for systemic exposure via blood aPTT tests and platelet count , as well as for local topical toxicity via examination for epistaxis and anosmia , along with any other adverse events . In the chronic phase , subjects will be administered the highest dose that was tolerated in the acute phase daily for fourteen days . Subjects will be tested for aPTT and platelet count , as well as epistaxis , anosmia and any other adverse events .","Study Objectives This exploratory clinical trial is designed to assess tolerability of increasing doses of intranasally administered heparin sodium in saline solution . Baseline values for aPTT and complete blood count will be obtained from six subjects . Heparin will be administered in increasing concentrations using one 0.1 mL ( millilitre ) spray per nostril ( 0.2 ml total ) on a daily basis . Major signs of toxicity will be clinically relevant changes in aPTT time , clinically relevant decrease in platelet count , signs of anosmia 30 minutes after administration , or epistaxis . Dosing will start at 1000 units of heparin administered ( 500 units in each nostril ) and then escalated to 2000 units . Should a clinically relevant aPTT prolongation ( > 50 % increase from subject baseline ) or decrease in platelet count ( below clinical lab normal limit ) be observed at either dose , the study will be halted and a series of lower doses evaluated . Study Overview Description of Design of Study This study is a single center , prospective , Phase 0 exploratory tolerability trial . A total of 6 healthy subjects ( 3 M and 3 F ) will be enrolled into the study . This study will evaluate the acute and multi-day ( 14 days ) tolerability of intranasally administered heparin . Test Article Investigational Product The study will assess the single and multi-dose tolerability of intranasal administration of an aliquot of an FDA-approved heparin sodium injection ( 5,000 USP units/mL or 10,000 USP units/mL ) to deliver 1000U ( units ) or 2000U of heparin sodium . Doses will be prepared and administered as follows : 1000 U = ( 2 x 0.1 mL ( milliliter ) of 5000U ( units ) /mL or one spray of 500 U in each nostril ) 2000 U = ( 2 x 0.1 mL of 10000U/mL or one spray of 1000 U in each nostril ) The test article will be administered by transferring ( 4 mL ) of sterile heparin sodium injection ( 5,000 USP units/mL or 10,000 USP units/mL ) at ambient room temperature into intranasal spray bottles , one for each individual subject . The test article will be administered within 4 weeks of preparation , and the remainder discarded after study completion . Supplier The test article ( Heparin Sodium USP ) will be obtained from appropriate commercial sources . Safety Assessments Safety assessments will be completed as part of this single and multi-dose , pharmacokinetic study . Safety will be assessed prior to test article administration and at 24 post dose , in the acute phase . For safety assessments during the chronic phase , safety assessments will be assessed prior to test article administration , day 14 and day 15-post study . Test subject will be called every three ( 3 ) days for updates and subjective reports ( adverse events ) , during 14 day , daily dose phase . Subject safety will be assessed by monitoring adverse events , clinical laboratory tests , vital signs , and physical examinations . Laboratory parameters will be evaluated during screening and daily , to include the following : Complete Blood Count ( WBC , RBC ( red blood cell count ) , Hematocrit , Hemoglobin , MCV ( mean corpuscular volume ) , Platelet Count ) PT ( prothrombin time ) /INR ( international normalized ratio ) Baseline and post study Serum/Urine hCG ( human chorionic gonadotropin ) baseline and predose Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time ( aPTT ) Clinical Adverse Events Clinical Adverse Events will be monitored throughout the study . However , such events are not anticipated during this trial due to the low systemic exposure of the test article being administered . However , local side effects of intranasal heparin , such as epistaxis or nasal congestion may result . For any abnormal lab values , test subjects will be evaluated for any sign and symptoms , and labs will be redrawn , until stabilized or returned to baseline .

Ain Shams Maternity Hospital,NCT04623632,Effect of TAP Block on Time Required for First Analgesic Dose After Cesarean Cection Under Spinal Anesthesia,Ain Shams Maternity Hospital,2,1,Postoperative Pain,Drug,Transversus abdominus plane block,Prevention,Double,"While opioids are the mainstay for post-operative analgesia after caesarean section , they are associated with various side effects . Ultrasound guided transversusabdominis plane ( TAP ) block has been postulated to provide effective analgesia for caesarean section . However a new technique in TAP block is described which can be used safely by a beginner without any fear of complication whichwill help in providing good postoperative analgesia to maximumnumber of patients . This study will evaluate the analgesic efficacy of TAP block using Modified Surgeon Assisted Bilateral TAP block for post caesarean analgesia in a randomized controlled trial .","Acute severe pain after cesarean delivery is frequent . At least 10 to 15 % of the women develop chronic pain .Effective postoperative analgesia after caesarean section is important because it enables early ambulation and facilitates breast-feeding . The administration of opioids , local blocks and other analgesic medication is instituted to decrease the duration and intensity of postoperative pain as a part of a multimodal analgesic regimen . The transversusabdominis plane ( TAP ) block is a regional analgesic technique which blocks T6-L1 nerve branches and has an evolving role in postoperative analgesia for lower abdominal surgeries . In postoperative analgesia , efficacy of TAP block is equivalent to morphine with the additional benefits of increasing duration of analgesia , reducing postoperative opioid usage , with satisfactory pain relief and few side effects . The TAP block avoids the risk of neuraxial complications and opioid complications in all patients . TAP block the neural afferents of theanterior abdominal wall after spreading of the local anesthetic agent in the neurofascial plan between the internal oblique and transversusabdominis muscle . TAP block has been underutilized in spite of having very low complication and high success rate using ultrasound technique This may be due to the lack of availability of ultrasound at most of the centers , lack of training in ultrasound guided block technique . A new technique can be used in TAP block without the fear of complications in the blind landmark based approach.The advantage of this technique includes avoiding missing the second pop in obese and pregnant patients due to thinning of the internal obliqueaponeurosis , reposition of the needle by surgeon if one enters the peritoneal cavity accidentally . Also there are nil chances of visceral injury thus can be safely used by a beginner without any fear of complication . However , there might be a chance of needle stick injury to the surgeon 's hand .

State University of New York at Buffalo,NCT04638400,Anti-inflammatory Effects of Simvastatin,paresh Dandona,4,0,Inflammation,Drug,Simvastatin 40mg,Basic Science,,The purpose of this research study is to determine which of the two ingredients of Vytorin ( Simvastatin or Ezetimibe ) is responsible for the anti-inflammatory effects of Vytorin,"Cardiovascular disease is currently the leading cause of death in the developed countries . Atherosclerosis is the most important cause of cardiovascular disease . Statins are known to exert a powerful anti-atherogenic action which is reflected in a marked beneficial effect on the prevention of cardiovascular effects and cardiovascular mortality . They induce a reduction in the progression and an increase in the regression of atherosclerotic lesions . Statins exert powerful effect on lowering LDLc and are also anti-inflammatory due to their ability to lower CRP concentrations . But little is known about their anti-inflammatory effects at a cellular and molecular levels in humans , in vivo . Vytorin , a preparation containing simvastatin and ezetimibe , has a powerful effect on lowering LDLc concentration through a combination of effects on the absorption of cholesterol from the gut and hepatic cholesterol biosynthesis . In our previous study we have shown that Vytorin exerts a potent anti-inflammatory effect in the obese in the fasting state and following acute inflammatory changes induced by the intake of cream . The IMPROVE-IT trial , which examined the benefits of adding ezetimibe to simvastatin , showed a small additional benefit of ezetimibe ( a 6 % reduction in cardiovascular events ) compared to simvastatin alone . This is marginal when compared to the established cardiovascular benefits of statins . We , therefore , explore further into the anti-inflammatory actions of the two components of Vytorin by comparing the effects of simvastatin versus ezetimibe on intracellular lipid and inflammation in obese patients to determine which of the two ingredients of Vytorin is responsible for the specific combination of these effects .",2020-10-07,"August 25, 2022","Inclusion Criteria : Age : 18 to 75 years of age .

The investigators aim to determine the effect of dosing on receipt of neuraxial anesthesia and pregnancy outcomes and evaluate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of unfractionated heparin in pregnancy .,"Venous thromboembolism is one of the leading causes of maternal morbidity and mortality , and antepartum hospitalizations place pregnant patients at an even higher risk of developing thromboembolism . As a result , there is an increased emphasis on administering pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis for antepartum patients with prolonged hospitalizations . Previously , standard dosing of unfractionated heparin was widely adopted for thromboprophylaxis in the pregnant population . However , due to a suspected altered metabolism of unfractionated heparin in pregnancy resulting in a decrease response , the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists ( ACOG ) currently recommends considering gestational age-based dosing for unfractionated heparin for thromboprophylaxis in pregnancy with standard dosing as an alternative option . The data supporting altered dosing is very limited . In addition , increased dosing of heparin may result in challenges in anesthetic management , potentially limiting the receipt of neuraxial anesthesia resulting in increased need for general anesthesia associated with both increased maternal and fetal risks . The potential effects of higher prophylactic unfractionated heparin dosing in pregnant patients need to be further explored before being widely adopted for inpatient antepartum thromboprophylaxis .

Celon Pharma SA,NCT04670757,Safety and Pharmacokinetics of JAK/ROCK Inhibitor in Healthy Volunteers,Celon Pharma SA,1,1,Healthy,Drug,CPL409116,Treatment,Double,"The aim of the following clinical trial is to determine safety an pharmacokinetic parameters in healthy volunteers after oral administration of Janus kinases and Rho-kinases inhibitor ( JAK/ROCKi ) , called CPL409116.Janus kinase ( JAK ) inhibitors are a new class of small molecule drugs that modulate inflammatory pathways by blocking one or more JAK receptors . In recent years , JAK inhibitors have emerged as a new option for the treatment of various inflammatory diseases , including rheumatoid arthritis , psoriatic arthritis , spondyloarthritis , skin disorders and others . CPL409116 inhibits JAK1 and JAK3 with less inhibitory activity against JAK2 and Tyk2 . Inhibition of these kinases decreases inflammatory cytokine release which in turn decreases lymphocyte activation and proliferation . Moreover , CPL409116 blocks Rho-kinases ( ROCKs ) , which are involved in diverse cellular processes including actin cytoskeleton organization , cell adhesion and motility , proliferation , apoptosis as well as smooth muscle contraction . ROCKs signalling is one of the major pathways implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular , renal as well as fibrotic diseases . However recent data indicate their role in immune cell regulation and inflammatory disease development . CPL409116 was designed predominantly for the therapy of immune-related diseases : rheumatoid arthritis , psoriasis and because antifibrotic therapies are needed . Dual inhibition of JAK/ROCK kinases may be beneficial for patients suffering from fibrotic complications of inflammatory disease . Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease characterised by persistent joint inflammation leading to loss of joint function as well as cartilage and bone damage . Chronic , progressive course of the disease results in disability , reduced quality of life , as well as higher comorbidity and mortality rates . It is well documented that JAK kinases play a pivotal role in cytokine receptor signalling to phosphorylate and activate signal transducer and activator of transcription ( STAT ) proteins . Several of these JAK-controlled cytokine receptor pathways are immediately involved in the initiation and progression of RA pathogenesis . Cytokines promote autoimmunity , maintain chronic inflammatory synovitis and drive the destruction of joint tissue . In consequence on the basis of the preclinical study results the IMP with the active ingredient CPL409116 has been classified as a good clinical candidate for the treatment of RA .",The following clinical trial consists of two phases IA and IB . Approximately 68 volunteers who meet all the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria are going to be enrolled into the study . Phase IA ( approx . 24 male and female volunteers ) is to evaluate safety and tolerability after single oral administration of the Investigational Medicinal Produkt ( IMP ) to healthy volunteers .

Methods : This was a randomized controlled trial of 200 women who attended the outpatient clinic of Menoufia University Hospital for elective cesarean surgery . The women were randomly assigned to two groups . The intervention group received PRP after surgery , whereas the control group received the usual care . Outcomes included Redness , Edema , Ecchymosis , Discharge , Approximation ( REEDA ) scale , Vancouver scar scale ( VSS ) , and the visual analog scale ( VAS ) .","The investigators conducted this randomized controlled trial from April 2018 to July 2020 at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Menoufia University Hospital , which is a large tertiary center in the Delta region in Egypt with a delivery rate of about 10000 per year . This study was approved by Menoufia university hospital ethical committee Institutional review board ( 198190PSGN33 ) . The investigators obtained informed consent from all participants before initiating any study procedures . CONSORT guidelines were observed and completed . The patients included in the study were between 20 and 40 years of age . Eligible women had one or more of the following risk factors : Body mass index ( BMI ) > 30 kglcm2 , prior cesarean section , pregestational or gestational diabetes , hypertensive disorders of pregnancy , placenta Previa , twin pregnancy , anemia , and corticosteroid medication . Exclusion criteria were chronic pain disorders , hepatitis , thrombocytopenia , and coagulation disorders . The investigators randomized participants in a 1:1 ratio to two equal groups containing one hundred patients each ( intervention and control groups ) . A statistician not directly involved in the study prepared a computer generated randomization list and placed the allocation information in sequentially numbered sealed envelopes that were opened according to the attendance of the patients after signing the informed consent . The study authors were unaware of the envelope allocation sequence . Participants and outcome assessors did not know which group had been assigned to for the duration of the study . In the operating room before the start of each procedure , approximately 15 cm of whole blood was drawn from the uninvolved arm of each patient in the intervention group ( group I ) into a 20 ml sterile syringe containing citrate for anticoagulation . The blood was immediately centrifuged at 3200 Revolutions per Minute ( PRM ) . Following 15 minutes of centrifugation , 4 - 5 mL of PRP was obtained . Then , the PRP was buffered by using sodium bicarbonate . After closure of the fascia and prior to skin closure , PRP was directly applied to the subcutaneous tissue of the wound site by using a sterile syringe . In the control group ( group II ) , the patients did not receive topical treatment and the subcutaneous tissue was cleaned with normal saline before skin closure . For all patients , the skin was closed with polyprolene 2-0 suture with a curved cutting needle . The patients were examined by the physicians who were blinded to the group allocation on day 1 , and then day 7 and 6 months after the procedure . Pain was evaluated by the visual analog scale system ( VAS ) which assesses changes of pain via a continuous measurement instrument that is operationally comprised of a horizontal line , anchored at each end by verbal descriptors such as no pain and the worst pain imaginable . The subject is asked to indicate a spot on the scale that best represents her degree of pain . The score is determined by measuring the distance ( mm ) between the no pain anchor to the point that the patient marks , providing a range of scores from 0 - 10 . A higher score indicates greater pain intensity . The primary outcome was the Redness , Edema , Ecchymosis , Discharge , Approximation ( REEDA ) scale for assessing the changes in wound healing . REEDA as a descriptive scale has 4 points in a categorical score that measures 5 items of healing : redness ( hyperemia ) , edema , ecchymosis , discharge , and approximation of the wound edges ( coaptation ) . Each item is rated on a scale of 0 to 3 , and total scores may range from 0 to 15 . A lower score indicates better healing . The secondary outcomes were measured by Vancouver scar scale ( VSS ) and VAS . VSS use to detect changes of formation of keloids or hypertrophic scars . It assesses 4 subjective variables : vascularity , height/thickness , pliability , and pigmentation within a possible range of 0 - 14 for the total score . The sample size was calculated by using Epi-Info program version 3.5.4 by adjusting confidence interval to 95 % . With an alpha error of 5 % and study power of 80 % and assuming a clinically relevant reduction in REEDA and VSS scores based on results of previous studies , the invesigators estimated a total sample size of 182 women ( 91 for each group ) . This was increased to 200 women considering about 10 % drop out rate . The data collected , were tabulated and analyzed by SPSS ( statistical package for the social science software ) statistical package version 20 ( Chicago Inc. , USA ) , the following tests were used ; Quantitative data were expressed as mean and standard deviation ( X ± SD ) and analyzed by applying student t test . Qualitative data were analyzed by Chi Square test .

Getz Pharma,NCT04665284,Safety And Efficacy Of Empagliflozin In Pakistani Muslim Population With Type Ii Diabetes Mellitus,Getz Pharma,4,1,Type II Diabetes Mellitus,Drug,Empagliflozin,Treatment,,To compare the safety and efficacy of empagliflozin versus other treatments in Pakistani Muslim population with type II diabetes mellitus .,"Diabetes is the one of the most common non-communicable diseases affecting 425 million adults worldwide . This figure is expected to rise to 629 million by the year 2045.1 90 % of the diabetic population has type 2 diabetes . 2 As of 2018 , more than 500 million individuals are residing with type 2 diabetes mellitus globally . 3 In Pakistan , the situation is similarly alarming . According to a recent survey , 16.98 % of the Pakistani population has diabetes.4 The primary target of therapy in diabetes mellitus is optimum blood glucose control . In case of type 2 diabetes , this is achieved by a combination of oral hypoglycemic agents and injectable drugs with insulin as a last resort . A number of oral agents targeting various sites of action are available . Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 ( SGLT2 ) inhibitors are newer class of drugs that have been introduced . They have a unique mechanism of action . By acting at the sodium glucose co-transporter , they block the reabsorption of glucose leading to an increase in urinary glucose excretion and lowering of plasma glucose.5 This action is completely independent of the beta cell function . There are several theoretical advantages to this approach . In addition to lowering blood glucose , the urinary glucose excretion results in loss of calories and weight reduction and the associated osmotic diuretic effect can aid in lowering blood pressures.6,7 Numerous studies have demonstrated a favorable risk benefit ratio of empagliflozin as monotherapy8 as well as add-on therapy to other hypoglycemic agents.9,10,11,12 They also have additional cardiovascular benefits with several studies documenting a reduction in mortality.13,14 Moreover , the sodium glucose co-transporters also demonstrated a reduction in the onset and worsening of nephropathy and preservation of renal function.15 This effect is not restricted to empagliflozin alone , as other drugs in the class have also demonstrated this benefit.16 Empagliflozin with its novel mechanism of action has its own set of side effects . Increased urinary glucose losses lead to a higher proportion of urinary tract infections and genital tract infections . This has been evidenced in various studies.17 The osmotic diuresis that benefits in lowering blood pressures at one end , also predisposes the patients to volume depletion.Empagliflozin , one of the three drugs from this class , approved by the FDA for treatment of type 2 diabetes . According to the recent ADA and the EASD guidelines , they have become an essential component of the algorithm recommended for managing type 2 diabetes.18 The recently published consensus statement by the South Asian Federation of Endocrine Societies has incorporated sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes as monotherapy in patients who are intolerant to or have any contraindication to metformin therapy . Additionally , drugs belonging to this class are also recommended as combination therapy with other oral hypoglycemic agents as well as insulin.19 Empagliflozin , however , has not been studied in the Pakistani population as yet . The main aim of this study is to establish the efficacy and safety of empagliflozin in optimum control of blood sugar in type 2 diabetes . This is the first study of its kind being performed in the Pakistani population .",2020-11-27,"December 10, 2020","Inclusion Criteria : Pakistani muslim male / female , type 2 diabetic patient having age from 18 years to 75 years Patient who give informed consent voluntarily BMI ≤45 kg/m2 Glycosylated hemoglobin of 7 - ≤10 % Exclusion Criteria : Patients who are on empagliflozin treatment Indication of liver disease , defined by serum levels of either alanine aminotransferase , aspartate aminotransferase , and alkaline phosphatase above 3 times upper limit to normal Estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) < 45 mL /min /1.73m2 History of recurrent urinary tract infection ( UTI ) and/or past 3 months ' history of UTI and its treatment Patients with positive urine culture for UTI at the time of screening Patients who have been admitted to the hospital in the past 3 months for diabetic ketoacidosis ( DKA ) and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state Patients with past 3 months ' history of fungal infection and its treatment History of blood dyscrasias or any disorders causing haemolysis or unstable red blood cell History of benign prostate hyperplasia Any acute coronary syndrome , stroke and/or transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) in the previous 3 months Any contraindication for patients to Biguanides , Sulfonylureas , DPP-IV inhibitors , SGLT-2 Inhibitors Treatment with anti-obesity drugs or any other treatment leading to unstable body weight Patients with past 6 weeks treatment history with systemic steroids or thyroid hormones or any other uncontrolled endocrine disorder except T2DM Pre-menopausal women who are nursing or pregnant or are of childbearing potential and not practicing an acceptable method of birth control Any other clinical condition that would jeopardize patients safety while participating in this study",244,0,18 Years,75 Years

COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organisation on 11 March 2020 . To date , tens of millions of cases have been reported and over 3 % of these cases have died . COVID-19 is an acute respiratory disease caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus from the Betacoronavirus genus , just like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV . SARS-CoV-2 is primarily transmitted person-to-person through respiratory droplets/close contact . Fomite transmission has also been shown as a transmission route . Common respiratory symptoms such as fever , sore throat , cough & shortness of breath , may appear 2 - 14 days after exposure . About 20 % of infected cases progress to severe disease resulting in an estimated 2 - 5 % mortality rate . With the unrelenting increase in cases being reported worldwide , there is thus an urgent need for therapeutics to be developed to treat disease & reduce further transmission in order to disrupt the ongoing pandemic . To date , there are no specific proven antiviral treatment to prevent disease progression from mild to severe respiratory dysfunction among COVID-19 patients . Supportive care is recommended for symptom relief & for severe cases . Numerous vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2 are under development . Tychan 's TY027 , a fully engineered human IgG , is one of the first few biologics in the world , specifically targeting SARS-CoV-2 , to enter human clinical trials . Preliminary data from our phase 1 healthy volunteer trial ( SCT-001 ; ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT04429529 ) reveals that TY027 is safe & well-tolerated up to 20 mg/kg tested . A total of 10 adverse events ( AEs ) were observed , all were of mild in intensity with none resulting in subject withdrawal from the study . There were no serious adverse events & no clinically relevant trends in mean clinical laboratory , physical examinations , vital signs or ECG results were observed . Pharmacokinetic profile of subjects across dose cohorts 1 - 4 , up to Day 14 , were comparable to those typical of human IgG1 antibody with serum concentrations declining in a biphasic manner . Exposure of TY027 , based on Cmax , increased in a linear & generally dose proportional manner . It is anticipated that TY027 , when administered to acutely infected COVID-19 patients , could reduce disease severity . It may potentially also be used as a prophylaxis against COVID-19 amongst high risk contacts .","This is a Phase 3 Multi-Site , Randomised , Placebo Controlled , Double Blind , Single Dose Study of TY027 for Early Treatment of COVID-19 . Efficacy and safety of single dose IV infusion of TY027 in COVID-19 patients will be assessed . A total of 1,305 COVID-19 patients will be enrolled . The first 15 patients will be randomised 1:1:1 to receive either ( i ) a single fixed dose of 1,500 mg TY027 , ( ii ) a single fixed dose of 2,000 mg TY027 or ( iii ) Placebo ( N = 5 per group ) for initial safety assessment . This safety assessment will comprise the safety review of clinical signs , adverse events ( AEs ) and laboratory test results up to Day 3 post-dose . Subsequent patients will be randomised 1:1 to receive either a single fixed dose of 2,000 mg TY027 ( 2,000 mg TY027 group ) or Placebo ( Placebo group ) ( N = 645 per group ) . All patients will be inpatient for up to 7 days post-dosing and followed up on Days 14 and 28 . If a patient becomes clinically well enough for discharge before Day 7 , at the discretion of attending physician , collection of subsequent events/parameters such as abbreviated physical examinations , vital signs , clinical laboratory assessments , pharmacodynamic assessment , biomarker assessment , disseminated intravascular coagulation assessment scheduled after discharge will no longer be feasbile . Conversely , if a patient was to be hospitalised beyond 7 days for medically indicated reasons , daily monitoring and medical assessment will continue , with any additional ad hoc sampling to be recorded as unscheduled visit ( s ) . Remote monitoring through a telephone or video call will be performed on days post-discharge as per originally scheduled in schedule of events , as well as on Day 14 while patients are serving their quarantine order or has been discharged home . All discharged patients are to contact the Principal Investigator or the study team as soon as possible should they experience a worsening of their condition , or if they are admitted to hospital for COVID-19-related symptoms , before their Day 28 visit . Final safety and efficacy analysis of all patients will be assessed at the end of the study .",2020-11-26,"March 8, 2022","Inclusion Criteria : Symptomatic and RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 within 6 days from symptom onset .

The effects of 5-days of pitolisant ( 8.9mg ) or placebo will be evaluated in a human laboratory using an alcohol self-administration methodology . In this within-subjects crossover design , heavy drinkers ( N=28 ) will be randomized to the order of exposure ( Pitolisant or placebo ) prior to completing two alcohol self-administration trials . Subjects will receive a priming drink of alcohol and will have access to 8 alcoholic drinks over a 2-hour period . The investigators anticipate that subjects will consume less alcohol during an alcohol self-administration trial when receiving Pitolisant compared to when they are receiving placebo . Significant Pitolisant-induced reductions in the quantity of alcohol self-administered will be considered to be an indication that this drug may have value as an AUD medication . This study may provide a rationale for phase II clinical studies testing Pitolisant with a treatment-seeking AUD population .",2020-10-15,"May 17, 2023","Inclusion Criteria : 21-55 years of age Able to verify age with a state or federal picture identification Exceeds safe weekly drinking limits during the 28 days prior to consent ( average of 14 drinks for women or 21 drinks for men per week ) Reports at least one episode of binge drinking ( > 3 drinks for women , > 4 drinks for men ) in the 28 days prior consent .

New York State Psychiatric Institute,NCT04650217,Levodopa and Exercise for Older Adults With Depression and Psychomotor Slowing,New York State Psychiatric Institute,4,0,Depressive Disorder,Drug,Carbidopa/levodopa,Treatment,Quadruple,"In this new research study , 80 adults aged > 60 years with a significant depressive disorder and slowed processing and/or gait speed will be randomized to receive levodopa ( L-DOPA ; which the Candidate has previously shown to increase psychomotor speed and decrease depressive symptoms in older adults ) , aerobic exercise ( itself an effective antidepressant treatment as monotherapy ) , or their combination in a 2x2 design incorporating placebo and a stretching/toning control . Participants will be evaluated before and after this 12-week duration study across cognitive domains , psychiatric symptoms , gait kinematics and mobility , and task-based magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) focused on effort-based decision making and reward processing . Data from this study will contribute toward the development of improved treatment and prevention strategies to maximize the functioning and active healthspan of older adults with neuropsychiatric disorders .","Late-Life Depression [ LLD ] ) , is prevalent , disabling , and associated with high rates of completed suicide . Among the LLD patients at the highest risk of these adverse outcomes are those who manifest decreased processing speed and/or decreased gait speed . To develop urgently needed novel therapeutics for LLD , a reasonable approach is to target systems underlying the development and persistence of psychomotor slowing . One such approach has been to augment dopaminergic signaling since post-mortem experiments and in vivo neuroimaging studies have implicated age-related dopaminergic decline in the development of slowing . L-DOPA is the immediate precursor of dopamine , is converted to dopamine in presynaptic dopaminergic nerve terminals , and enhances dopaminergic transmission in multiple brain regions . As opposed to other dopaminergic interventions ( i.e. , dopamine receptor agonists and stimulants ) , a large literature shows beneficial effects of L-DOPA on cognitive performance and gait in patients with Parkinson 's disease , all while being a safe and well-tolerated medication that is difficult to differentiate from placebo in terms of side effects . A second therapeutic strategy that has been tested for LLD and is relevant to psychomotor slowing is aerobic exercise training . A number of reports and meta-analytic reviews suggest that exercise is an effective non-pharmacologic treatment for depression , including depression in older adults . The largest recent study found that progressive aerobic exercise conducted three times weekly for 30min over 24 weeks was effective for depression and was tolerated extremely well ( 14.3 % drop-out rate , 70 % intervention adherence ) . Exercise training may be effective for LLD by counteracting deleterious age-related changes related to its development and maintenance , such as by reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines , normalizing hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis hyperactivity , and decreasing physical disability and social isolation . Exercise also appears to facilitate adaptive neuroplastic changes in the hippocampus , prefrontal cortex ( PFC ) , and anterior cingulate cortex ( ACC ) as well as increased white matter connectivity . While both dopaminergic augmentation and exercise are promising interventions , neither treatment alone may be sufficient to address the serious adverse medical and psychiatric outcomes associated with LLD and psychomotor slowing . In our preliminary study ( NYSPI IRB # 7270 ) , L-DOPA was associated with significant improvements in gait speed , but the effect size of this improvement was only moderate ( d=0.4 ) . L-DOPA failed to increase average gait speed in this study above the 1m/s threshold associated with functional disability and increased mortality risk in epidemiologic samples . While exercise has not been studied specifically in this patient population , meta-analyses of exercise interventions in older adults suggest overall effects on gait speed are modest ( d=0.3 ) and perhaps not clinically significant . Thus , one goal of this study is to combine these interventions having complementary mechanisms of action to realize a greater therapeutic benefit . This study includes task-based functional MRI that will allow us to probe the differential therapeutic mechanisms of L-DOPA and exercise and further elucidate the nature of effort-based decision making and reward deficits in LLD . Decision making about voluntary behavior requires weighing the benefit of potential rewards against the effort cost required to achieve them . This calculation is performed by separable populations of dopaminergic midbrain neurons whose signals for value and effort are integrated with the ventral striatum ( VS ) . Anterior VS ( AVS ) consistently has been shown to encode subjective value , increasing with the probability of reward and decreasing with effort discounting , while recent work suggests dorsomedial VS ( dmVS ) activates during the initiation of effortful action . We hypothesize that older adults are biased toward inactivity ( and thereby at risk for depression ) on the basis of dopaminergic decline that diminishes subjective value estimates and increases the effort cost of action ( i.e. , by the development of slowing ) . Among PD patients , L-DOPA increases willingness to work independently of facilitating movement by increasing subjective value estimates . By increasing fitness and helping individuals learn about their increasing capacities , exercise may facilitate effort initiation . Below , we evaluate whether complementary effects on effortful behavior may be achievable via L-DOPA increasing subjective value and Exercise reducing effort cost .",2020-11-17,"January 18, 2023","Inclusion Criteria : Aged greater than or equal to 60 years Diagnostic and Statistical Manual ( DSM ) 5 MDD , Dysthymia , or Depression Not Otherwise Specified ( NOS ) Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression ( HRSD ) greater than or equal to 18 Decreased processing speed ( defined as 1 SD below age-adjusted norms on the Digit Symbol Test ) or decreased gait speed ( defined as average walking speed over 15 ' course less than 1m/s ) Willing to and capable of providing informed consent and complying with study procedures Exclusion Criteria : Substance abuse or dependence ( excluding Tobacco Use Disorder ) within the past 12 months History of psychosis , psychotic disorder , mania , or bipolar disorder Probable Alzheimer 's Disease , Vascular Dementia , or Parkinson 's disease Mini Mental Status Examination ( MMSE ) less than or equal to 24 HRSD suicide item greater than 2 or Clinical Global Impressions ( CGI ) Severity score of 7 at baseline Current or recent ( within the past 4 weeks ) treatment with antidepressants , antipsychotics , or mood stabilizers History of allergy , hypersensitivity reaction , or severe intolerance to levodopa/carbidopa Any physical or intellectual disability adversely affecting ability to complete assessments , including physical inability to perform treadmill testing and exercise protocol Acute , severe , or unstable medical or neurological illness Mobility limiting osteoarthritis of any lower extremity joints , symptomatic lumbar spine disease , history of joint replacement surgery , or history of spine surgery Contraindication to magnetic resonance imaging",1,0,60 Years,100 Years
