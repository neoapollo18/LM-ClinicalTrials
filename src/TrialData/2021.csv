The reasons of the former are lake of nutrients , bone marrow disorder , low level tropic hormone , inflammation associated with infectious , inflammatory , or malignant disorders and the latter are intravascular hemolysis or blood loss . Anemia is characterized by the sign of pallor ( reduced oxyhemoglobin in skin or mucous membranes ) , fatigue , lightheadedness , and weakness associated with low hemoglobin . Iron deficiency anemia ( IDA ) is mainly resulted from inadequate iron uptake of food , malabsorption of iron and blood loss . Adult female are easy to have IDA compared to male because of menstruation , pregnancy , lactation and low caloric uptake leading to iron deficiency . In Taiwan , cancer-related and chronic kidney disease also lead to insufficient secretion of erythropoietin ( EPO ) . The cost of long-term use EPO and its derivative drugs is high . Besides , drug resistance , risk of tumor growth and cardiovascular disease are all important issues . However , ferrotherapy will induce GI upset , muscle pain and skin hives .

In this Phase 1/2 clinical trial , we will be addressing the knee joint in conjunction with microfracture surgery . HST003 is human extracellular matrix secreted by human dermal fibroblasts under hypoxic conditions . The various matrix proteins produce a combination structural scaffold in addition to the natural secreted glycoproteins such as lubricin , fibronectin , laminins , hyaluronic acid , and collagens - all critical components of cartilage , particularly hyaline cartilage . This Phase 1/2 study will help design additional studies to support FDA approval for the use of HST003 in focal cartilage defects in the knee resulting from recent traumatic injury .","HST003 belongs to a new class of natural human matrix components geared toward cartilage regeneration . The bulk of this purified hECM is structural collagens , actin , and tubulin , but it also contains structural glycoproteins . HST003 is a physiological scaffold to support the infiltration of autologous mesenchymal stem cells to regenerate cartilage , and preferably hyaline cartilage . The safety of HST003 is supported by preclinical data , which show that hECM is nontoxic , noncytotoxic , nongenotoxic , non-irritant , non-sensitizing , and non-pyrogenic . The preclinical data summary is contained in the Investigator Brochure ( IB ) including biocompatibility data . A description of the manufacture , chemistry , efficacy , and preclinical safety of HST003 is also provided in the IB .

Mechanistically , tolerogenic fibroblasts produce anti-inflammatory and immune modulatory factors , which appear to be therapeutic in the context of autoimmunity , including IL-10 and TGF-beta . Additionally , tolerogenic fibroblasts produce neurotrophic mediators that enhance myelin production and/or prevent neuronal apoptosis .

Research Hypothesis : Intravenous administration of 100 million tolerogenic fibroblasts will be well tolerated and induce a therapeutic effect in relapse remitting MS patients . Rationale : The family of Mesenchymal Stem Cells ( MSCs ) is immune-modulatory , and bone marrow MSCs ( BM-MSCs ) have induced therapeutic responses in patients with MS [ 1 ] . Tolerogenic fibroblasts possess superior immune modulatory activity compared to BM-MSCs and adipose MSCs .

The major thermoregulatory defences in humans are sweating , arteriovenous shunt vasoconstriction , and shivering . Inadvertent hypothermia often complicates prolonged surgery . In patients becoming sufficiently hypothermic , reemergence of thermoregulatory vasoconstriction usually prevents further core hypothermia . The extent to which anesthetics reduce the vasoconstriction threshold depends on the type of drug and its concentration .","When propofol induces anesthesia , blood pressure decreases due to vasodilation , which is due to direct action on vascular smooth muscle and vasodilation due to blockage of the sympathetic nervous system . This results in a redistribution of body temperature , resulting in hypothermia . The effects of remimazolam on the central nervous system , respiratory and cardiovascular system have been studied . Remimazolam , a new type of benzodiazepine drug acts on the GABA-A receptor and has the advantages of rapid induction , rapid recovery , stable hemodynamics , and mild respiratory inhibition . At present , there is little literature on its practice in intraoperative thermoregulation under general anesthesia . Investigators hypothesized that the type of anesthetic agents might affect thermoregulatory mechanisms such as the redistribution of body heat , cutaneous heat loss or inhibition of thermoregulatory vasoconstriction .

Promising results of oral zinc gluconate in improving acne vulgaris has been described . A randomized , double blind , placebo-controlled clinical trial was utilized for this study with the objective to assess the efficacy of oral zinc gluconate in the improvement of disease activity in acne vulgaris patients as measured by the inflammatory score and Global Acne Grading System ( GAGS ) score .","Acne has four main pathogenic contributors : follicular hyperkeratinization , increased sebum production , Propionibacterium acnes ( P. acnes ) within the follicle , and inflammation . Treatment options for acne vulgaris include benzoyl peroxide , topical and oral retinoids , topical and oral antimicrobials , oral corticosteroids , and physical modalities such as acne surgery , laser and light therapy . Reports show that antibiotic resistance is a growing issue in the treatment regimen of acne vulgaris , making it less and less suitable for long-term treatment , hence other options that can be substitutes or adjuncts to treatment may be useful in this condition . For long-term or maintenance therapy , physicians should consider effectivity , cost , and adverse effects . Several studies have explored the effect of oral zinc on acne vulgaris . Since zinc is more cost-effective and has less adverse effects compared to most antibiotics , this may prove helpful for the Filipino patient in terms of safety and economy for long-term therapy . The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of oral zinc gluconate in the improvement of disease activity in acne vulgaris patients , to determine the demographic and clinical profile of Acne Vulgaris patients , to determine the disease activity measured by the inflammatory score and GAGS score of acne vulgaris patients on initial consult , at 4 weeks , and at 8 weeks , and to determine if there is a significant difference in disease activity as measured by the inflammatory score and GAGS score among acne vulgaris patients given placebo and oral zinc gluconate .

The extent of the arterial deoxygenation may be influenced by a histamine-mediated inflammatory response at the pulmonary capillary-alveolar membrane limiting oxygen diffusion . Moreover , while EIAH has been routinely explored in running and cycling , swimming is understudied despite potential mechanistic avenues which may put swimmers at further risk for EIAH . The purpose of this study is threefold : 1 ) to determine whether highly-trained swimmers experience EIAH during submaximal and maximal exercise , 2 ) to determine the extent to which histamine release influences oxyhemoglobin saturation during swimming exercise , and 3 ) to determine whether nedocromil sodium ( NS ) , a mast cell stabilizer , and cetirizine HCl ( CH ) , an H1-receptor competitive inhibitor , can improve oxyhemoglobin saturation during submaximal and maximal swimming exercise . Twenty-six ( 13 men , 13 women ) highly-trained swimmers will complete an intense swimming protocol to assess the histamine response to intense exercise . A subset with the highest histamine responses will participate in three additional sessions ( placebo , NS , and CH conditions ) which will include a swimming aerobic capacity test and 5-minutes of swimming at both 70 and 85 % of their maximal oxygen uptake .","For the first testing session , participants will report to the Indiana University Human Performance Laboratory to complete a medical screening and , if willing , consent to the procedures of the study . The medical screening will include measurements of height , weight , resting heart rate , resting blood pressure , and resting pulmonary function along with a health history questionnaire . The second testing session consists of an assessment of risk factors for development of EIAH , specifically changes in blood biomarkers pre- and post-swimming exercise . Participants will report to the Counsilman-Billingsley Aquatics Center and complete an exercise protocol designed to elicit an inflammatory response . Venous blood draws will be performed to assess participants ' pre-exercise complete blood count and pre- and post-intense exercise concentrations of plasma IL-1β , IL-8 , plasma histamine , whole blood histamine , and histamine release . Measurements of hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit will also be performed pre- and post-exercise in order to correct biomarker concentrations for fluid loss during exercise . Swimmers of each sex that exhibit the largest histamine release will be selected for further study until at least four swimmers of each sex complete all three experimental trials . Participants that exhibit increases in inflammatory markers following swimming exercise will visit the Human Performance Laboratory on three occasions separated by at least 48 hours and no more than 60 days . Apart from receiving a placebo ( PL ) or different drug treatment ( nedocromil sodium , NS ; cetirizine HCl , CH ) prior to exercise , participants will perform identical protocols on each visit to the laboratory . Participants will report to the lab and consume either a placebo or CH pill , followed by a health history update questionnaire and their resting pulmonary function will be measured . Participants will then complete a self-selected warm-up that will be standardized across all three testing sessions , followed by administration of either a placebo or NS through an inhaler and instrumentation . The exercise protocol beings with a progressive swimming test to maximum aerobic capacity ( V̇O2max ) in a swimming flume , followed by two constant load work bouts at approximately 70 and 85 % of the previously recorded HRmax while peripheral capillary oxyhemoglobin saturation ( SpO2 ) is continuously monitored . Participants will receive a 20-min break between each work bout .

New York State Psychiatric Institute,NCT04697693,Antidepressant Response in Older Adults With Comorbid PTSD and MDD,New York State Psychiatric Institute,4,0,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,Drug,Escitalopram,Treatment,,"In the Investigator 's ongoing studies of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) in older adults , it has been found that older adults with PTSD frequently meet the criteria for comorbid Major Depressive Disorder ( MDD ) . Moreover , relative to trauma-exposed healthy controls ( TEHCs ) , elders with PTSD manifest executive function deficits , fatigability , and mobility and physical function deficits that are consistent with what the investigator has observed in depressed older adults . Yet , the investigator has found that very few older adults with combined PTSD/MDD have received appropriate antidepressant treatment for their condition . These findings give rise to the questions of ( 1 ) how effective is antidepressant treatment for depressive symptoms in the context of PTSD/MDD and ( 2 ) are cognitive and physical function deficits in PTSD/MDD patients reversible with effective antidepressant treatment ?","Chronic PTSD in older adults leads to increased risk of mortality from cardiovascular disease , metabolic syndrome , diabetes mellitus , and ulcerative gastrointestinal disease . PTSD appears to promote aging-associated syndromes such as frailty , and older patients with PTSD exhibit faster cognitive decline and have twice the risk of dementia compared to individuals without PTSD . In addition , laboratory studies report accelerated biological signatures of aging in PTSD patients , including shortened leukocyte telomere length , increases in pro-inflammatory cytokines , and increased oxidative stress . PTSD is associated with similar anatomical brain changes to those occurring with cognitive aging , including bilateral hippocampal volume reductions , specifically affecting the dentate gyrus ( DG ) and CA3 subregion , and increased microvascular lesions ( white matter hyperintensities [ WMH ] ) . These observations suggest that the adverse health and functional outcomes associated with chronic PTSD in older patients may be explained by a deleterious interaction between pathophysiologic changes underlying PTSD and the biology of aging , the end result of which is to accelerate senescence throughout the body and particularly in the brain . However , no prior study has explicitly tested this hypothesis by examining indices of aging in older adults with and without PTSD . In our ongoing IRB # 7489 , The investigator hypothesize that chronic PTSD , over and above other contributing factors , accelerates biological aging in the brain and body , leading to adverse behavioral consequences such as frailty and cognitive decline . To test these hypotheses , 150 individuals are being recruited who are aged≥50and diagnosed with PTSD . A control group of 150 age- , sex- , and trauma exposure-matched subjects without PTSD are being recruited and assessed . Included subjects undergo comprehensive neuropsychological assessment and cerebral blood volume functional magnetic resonance imaging ( CBV-fMRI ) to assess regional hippocampal metabolic activity and function . Structural MRI is performed to quantify WMH , regional brain volume , and cortical thickness while resting-state fMRI measures functional connectivity within hippocampal networks . PTSD subjects and controls are compared on measures of aging within the following domains : neural ( DG CBV , WMH , morphology ) , cognitive ( processing speed , memory , executive function , pattern separation ) , somatic ( peripheral inflammatory markers , leukocyte telomere length , and measures of oxidative stress ) , and behavioral ( grip strength , gait speed , fatigue levels ) . By elucidating the interaction of chronic PTSD with aging processes , data from this project may contribute to the development of rationally designed , personalized , and age-appropriate novel treatments . Interim analyses of PTSD subjects in this study demonstrate a high degree of comorbidity with MDD . Among participants with PTSD enrolled to date , 67.1 % meet the criteria for MDD and the mean Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression ( HRSD ) is 18.1 . The most prominent cognitive differences observed to date in our study between PTSD and TEHC subjects is executive dysfunction , which is common in late-life depression . PTSD subjects have dramatically increased fatigability and prevalence of frailty criteria compared to TEHCs , abnormalities which are also frequently seen in our older MDD samples . Yet , the investigator has found that less than 25 % of these individuals are currently receiving an adequate dose and duration of first-line pharmacotherapy for MDD , while only one-third report any past medication treatment . These data raise the question of whether patients with combined PTSD/MDD could benefit from adequate antidepressant medication treatment and to what degree their cognitive and physical function deficits would be reversible with this therapy .",2021-01-04,"April 12, 2022","Inclusion Criteria : Individual has completed IRB 7489 Diagnosed with DSM 5 MDD HRSD > =18 Willing to and capable of providing informed consent and complying with study procedures .

"Ophirex, Inc.",NCT04969991,Study of Varespladib in Patients Hospitalized With Severe COVID-19,"Ophirex, Inc.",2,0,Coronavirus Disease 2019,Drug,Varespladib,Treatment,Quadruple,"This is a 2-part , multi-center , randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , phase 2 study designed to evaluate the safety , tolerability , and efficacy of oral varespladib , in addition to standard of care , in patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 .","The goals of this 2-part , multi-center , randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , phase 2 study are to define a safe dose for the population and to assess the safety , tolerability , and efficacy of orally dosed varespladib to improve survival without respiratory failure in patients hospitalized with severe coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID-19 ) , when given in addition to the institutional standard of care therapy . Mortality rates of COVID-19 are strongly linked to acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) which may be , additionally , correlated with elevations of secretory phospholipase 2 ( sPLA2 ) and widespread loss of functioning lung tissue . Upregulation of sPLA2 is thought to be involved in the dysregulated inflammatory cascade pathways ( increased markers of immune activation , also known as cytokine release syndrome ) and enzymatic degradation of lung surfactant linked to the development of ARDS . It is believed that treatment with varespladib , a potent inhibitor of sPLA2 , might prevent or mitigate progression of pulmonary dysfunction in COVID-19 patients by two mechanisms : suppression of sPLA2-induced inflammation and , uniquely , preservation of pulmonary surfactant by direct inhibition of the enzyme responsible for surfactant phospholipid degradation : sPLA2 . Data from previous phase 2 clinical trials of varespladib suggested it had potential to reduce mortality in severely septic patients with ARDS , particularly when treatment was initiated within 18 hours of identification of organ failure . The study will be conducted in two parts . Both parts will be randomized and double-blind . Part 1 will be dose-finding in four parallel treatment groups randomized to treatment with varespladib ( at 250 mg once daily [ QD ] , twice daily [ BID ] , or three times daily [ TID ] [ 250 , 500 , or 750 mg/day ] ) or placebo in a 5:5:5:3 ratio . After all participants in Part 1 have completed Day 28 , a data safety monitoring board ( DSMB ) will review the safety results from Part 1 , including all available safety data through Day 60 , and will recommend the dose regimen to be used in Part 2 . Part 2 will randomize an additional 72 participants to the dose regimen selected from Part 1 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio . In both parts of the study , eligible participants will be enrolled and randomized to receive active varespladib or placebo in addition to institutional standard of care for 7 days . Participants will be assessed daily per standard of care while hospitalized and on a regular basis after discharge . The Day 1 , 4 , 7 , 14 , and 28 visits will be performed in person ( either at the hospital/site or via a home health provider ) to assess safety , obtain blood and urine samples for laboratory tests , and obtain clinical outcome data . The Day 2 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 , 45 , and 60 visits for discharged participants may be conducted by phone or via electronic patient-reported outcome ( ePRO ) devices . Efficacy will be assessed by respiratory failure-free survival at Day 28 . Safety will be assessed by evaluating adverse events ( AEs ) , vital sign measurements , use of oxygen therapies , changes in levels of biomarkers , clinical laboratory test results , electrocardiograms ( ECGs ) , physical examination findings , and concomitant medications and therapies . A DSMB will evaluate safety data at specified intervals during both parts of the trial . Pharmacokinetic ( PK ) samples will be drawn from all participants in Part 1 and in a subset of approximately 14 participants in Part 2 in order to enable estimation of PK parameters in approximately 22 participants receiving active treatment with varespladib .",2021-07-08,"August 3, 2023","Inclusion Criteria : Participant is hospitalized with severe COVID-19 illness , defined in accordance with the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) Guidance for Industry - COVID-19 : Developing Drugs and Biological Products for Treatment or Prevention ( May 2020 ) : a .

Screening and Enrollment This trial will enroll over a 6-month period and take place at three sites ( Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children 's Hospital of Chicago , Cincinnati Children 's Hospital Medical Center and The Children 's Hospital of Philadelphia ) that are or were members of the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network ( PECARN ) , a federally funded network of 18 pediatric EDs that have an established and successful history of completing large-scale clinical trials in the ED . This study will enroll 36 patients in total ( 2 patients per month , per site ) . Clinical research coordinators ( CRCs ) at participating EDs will screen potentially eligible patients with respiratory tract symptoms and discuss eligibility with the treating attending physician . If thought to be eligible and a diagnosis of CAP is presumed by the treating physician , the CRC will approach the patient to complete screening procedures . The study will proceed in 2 stages , each with its own informed consent process . During Stage 1 , baseline characteristics and serum PCT levels will be ascertained . Stage 2 will consist of a randomized trial of amoxicillin vs. placebo in the subset of patients from Stage 1 that have PCT < 0.25 ng/mL . Randomization After enrollment and confirmation of a PCT < 0.25 ng/mL , patients will be randomized to a 10-day course of either amoxicillin ( 80-100 mg/kg divided BID up to 4,000 mg/day ) or placebo . Randomization to amoxicillin or placebo will be at a 1:1 ratio with block sizes of 2 and 4 . Patients will be stratified by the clinical site and randomization will be performed through an online system . As a double-blind clinical trial , the study patients and their parents/guardians , investigators and study staff will be blinded to study treatment assignment for the duration of the study . Study Drug Administration Local investigational drug pharmacies will be provided with active study medication ( i.e. , amoxicillin ) and matching placebo . Site pharmacies at each institution will store study drug and dispense as needed . Study medications will both be liquid reconstituted from powder , and will resemble each other with regards to appearance , favor , consistency and packaging . Study products will be labeled with numerical codes that will maintain allocation concealment . Site investigational pharmacies will be provided with amoxicillin and placebo , in addition to the randomization scheme . The pharmacy will aliquot amoxicillin and placebo into blinded bottles based on randomization scheme . Follow-up The guardians of participants will be asked to complete a daily symptom diary , using an online data collection form in REDCap , during the first 7 days after the initial Emergency Department study visit . The follow-up will assess patient condition , clinical response , signs or symptoms of clinical deterioration and other adverse effects . The primary outcome will be assessed at day 7 ( +/- 2 days ) , using video chat technology that is standard on most smart phones , tablets , and computers . Video follow-up will be performed by site clinician investigators . In the rare case that a mobile device or computer with video chat technology is not available to the family , the day 7 follow-up will occur by telephone or text through an online system . A final follow-up , performed by site research staff , by telephone call , will occur at Day 21 ( +/- 2 days ) to assess overall disease course and secondary outcomes . Data Collection At baseline , demographics , medical history , and history of current illness will be obtained from all participants during stage 1 ( pre-randomization ) . Vital signs will be obtained and a brief physical examination will be performed . After the initial ED visit , patients will record symptoms on daily basis for 6 days via an online data collection form . Follow-up assessments will be completed via telehealth visit or telephone for days 7 and 21 . Follow-up visits will collect data regarding symptoms , adverse events and return to medical care , in addition to assessing adherence to study procedures ( i.e. , medication adherence and daily symptom diary completion ) .

Design : A single-blinded , prospective randomized parallel controlled clinical trial was designed and conducted from December 2019 to November 2020 . The study was conducted in an academic hospital . 82 patients with a gallstone , gallbladder polyp and other benign gallbladder diseases were enrolled in this study . Finally , 82 patients were randomly divided into the Micro Hand S surgical robot group and the da Vinci surgical robot group . Interventions : Standard robot-assisted transabdominal cholecystectomy was conducted using the Micro Hand S robot or the da Vinci robot . Main outcomes and measures : The main outcome was the success rate of operation . Surgical success was defined as that the surgical procedures were completed by the experimental or control product without transferring to non-robotic surgery . Secondary outcomes included assembly time , operation time , intraoperative hemorrhage , time to first flatus , postoperative pain , comprehensive complication index , resident time and patient satisfaction . Background : Cholecystectomy is one of the most common operations in general surgery , with about half a million patients getting cholecystectomy each year in the United States . In the 1990s , minimally invasive surgery ( MIS ) , as a new technology , greatly improved the traditional open abdominal surgery , of which defects are known as the big wound and long time to recover . Today , nearly 90 % of cholecystectomy are performed laparoscopically . Previous studies have shown that laparoscopic cholecystectomy may reduce postoperative pain , shorten the hospital stay , and save the overall cost in hospital , which has become the standard operation for the treatment of gallbladder disease . In recent years , robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery has become more and more widely used in general surgery because of its advantages of 3D visions , high magnification , tremor suppression , and precise manipulation . According to a reported retrospective study , the da Vinci robot-assisted cholecystectomy showed excellent operation security , which can achieve the same therapeutic effect as the conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy . But studies also reported that the increased cost may be the main problem of the da Vinci robot-assisted cholecystectomy . The Micro Hand S surgical robot is a new generation of Chinese independently developed surgical robot system . Apart from the flexibility and intelligence in operation manipulation , the Micro Hand S surgical robot also has the advantages of small size , portable equipment , low maintenance costs and outstanding equipment compatibility . After initial preclinical trials , the Micro Hand S surgical robot has been successfully applied in clinic , and proved security and feasibility in various gastrointestinal surgery . Since 2019 , investigators in this group have designed and taken up research to assist laparoscopic cholecystectomy with the Micro Hand S surgical robot , which is noted as a prospective , randomized , single-blind , and parallel controlled clinical trial . The primary purpose of this study is to determine whether the newly developed Chinese Micro Hand S surgical robot results in non-inferiority outcomes in cholecystectomy compared with the prevalent da Vinci robot . Method : The study was designed as a single-blind prospective randomized clinical trial since it is inevitable for the surgeon to know what kind of robot to use during the operation . After obtaining the approval of the Ethics Review Committee and other relevant institutions of the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University , a total of 82 patients were included in this study from December 2019 to November 2020 . Finally , 82 patients were randomly divided into the Micro Hand S robot group and the da Vinci robot group . All enrolled patients were fully informed and signed the informed consent . Patients were randomly assigned to each group in a 1:1 ratio , and information of the grouping and intervention measures were not available to patients . Patients of each group were matched for age , sex , body mass index ( BMI ) , and complications to reduce confounding intervention factors . Surgical procedure : The patient was placed in the supine position after general anesthesia . The Veress needle was inserted at 2cm below the umbilicus ( point A ) to establish the CO2 artificial pneumoperitoneum . A 12mm trocar was inserted into the abdominal cavity and the pneumoperitoneum tube was connected to the trocar . The intra-abdominal pressure was set at 11-13mmHg , and then the preheated three-dimensional laparoscope and cold-light source were placed into the abdominal cavity through the trocar . Then a thorough examination was taken on the intended trocar points and the surgical area . After adjusting the patient with a Trendelenburg position inclined to the left , 10.5mm magnetic trocars were respectively placed at 2-3cm medial side of the right anterior axillary line , 8-10cm below the costal margin ( point B ) ; and 2-3cm below the costal margin of the left mid-clavicular line ( point C ) ; and were connected to the robotic arms No . 1 and 2 . Besides , a 10mm trocar were placed at point D ( lateral inferior of the line connecting point A and C ) as the auxiliary channel . The surgeon held the neck of the gallbladder or Hartmann 's Pouch with bipolar forceps , and pulled the neck to the right upper to open the serosal layer of the cystic duct . The cystic duct and the cystic artery were then separated by blunt dissection so as to distinguish the common bile duct , hepatic common bile duct , and cystic duct . Clamp and cut off the cystic duct near the gallbladder 's neck with a Hemo-lock clamp . The cystic artery was found medial posterior side of the cystic duct . Clamp and cut off the cystic artery with Hemo-lock clamp . Pull the gallbladder 's neck upward and remove the gallbladder by anterograde resection with an ultrasonic knife . The assistant assisted in dragging the gallbladder and the liver bed to keep a certain tension . The intact gallbladder was put into the specimen bag and removed . Bleeding and bile leakage was carefully checked , and the gallbladder bed was coagulated . The operating instruments were withdrawn from the patient 's abdominal cavity after checking the instruments and the gauze . The pneumoperitoneum was exsufflated and the incisions were closed . During the operation , the assembly time , intraoperative blood loss , operation time , operation success rate , and the adjacent organ and vascular injury caused by the failure of the tested system were recorded . Pain score was analyzed 24±2 hours after the surgery . The vital signs ( temperature , pulse , respiration , blood pressure ) were measured on the 3rd day postoperatively . Meanwhile , the routine blood test ( red blood cells , white blood cells and neutrophils , platelet , hemoglobin ) , liver and renal function ( ALT , AST , TP , ALB , GLU , TBIL , BUN , and CREA ) , the electrolyte ( K , Na , Cl , Ca ) , blood sugar , and color ultrasound of liver , gallbladder , pancreas and spleen were checked . Operating surgeons filled in the satisfaction questionnaire postoperatively . Furthermore , the patients ' postoperative condition changes , postoperative medication , the first postoperative anal exhaust , postoperative complications , and resident time were also recorded . All the patients were followed up by telephone at 30±5 days postoperatively to evaluate the incidncee of adverse events .",2021-03-12,"March 16, 2021","Inclusion Criteria : from 18 to 65 years old ; patients with acute or chronic cholecystitis , gallstone , gallbladder polyp and other benign gallbladder diseases ; BMI was 18-30 kg/m2 ; the American Society of Anesthesiologists ( ASA ) classification was I , II , or III .

"National Cancer Institute, Egypt",NCT04813016,Intraperitoneal Tramadol Versus Dexmedetomedine for Analgesia After Abdominal Laparoscopic Cancer Surgeries,"National Cancer Institute, Egypt",2,1,Analgesia,Drug,Tramal 1,Treatment,Double,"Multiple modalities for postoperative analgesia after laparoscopic procedures has been used , of them intraperitoneal route ( IP ) was used to decrease the analgesic requirements . Both early and late bupivacaine and tramadol versus bupivacaine and dexmedetomedine will be tried to choose which is having a better analgesic profile .","Recently laparoscopic procedures have become popular and familiar to both surgeons and anesthetists . They have many advantages such as rapid postoperative recovery , low postoperative complication rates , early mobilization , and early home discharge ; consequently reduce hospital stay and costs . Although previous studies have been shown that laparoscopy is associated with less pain than laparotomy , it is not totally pain free . Some laparoscopic procedures for abdominal cancer surgeries has shown that there may be more intense pain and greater analgesic requirements in the immediate postoperative period than after open laparotomy . Thoroughly understanding the difference of pain generators in laparotomy than in laparoscopy gave some ideas helping in the control of each of them . While laparotomy results mainly in parietal pain , visceral pain remains predominantly in patients after laparoscopic surgeries resulting from the stretching of intra-abdominal cavity , peritoneal inflammation and phrenic nerve irritation caused by residual carbon dioxide in the peritoneal cavity resulting in postoperative abdominal and shoulder pain after laparoscopy . Hence , Intraperitoneal ( IP ) administration of some drugs can be effective for pain relief after laparoscopic surgery . The results have been variable as the published studies are heterogeneous and often lack appropriate controls . For that , no definitive conclusion can yet be made regarding its value and effectiveness . The α2-adrenergic agonist provides excellent sedation , anxiolysis , analgesia and sympatholysis . Of them , dexmedetomidine has become one of the frequently used drugs in anaesthesia aiming to its hemodynamic , sedative , anxiolytic , analgesic , neuroprotective and anaesthetic sparing effect . In addition , the high selectivity of dexmedetomidine to α2- receptors favored its widespread use in regional anaesthesia practice and local nerve blocks techniques . As noradrenergic neurons descending through the dorso-lateral funiculus from the brainstem to the dorsal horn significantly contribute in the modulation of pain by controlling impulse transmission ( descending inhibitory pathway ) . Adrenergic agonists , such as dexmedetomedine , possess significant antinociceptive activity by a central action on the brainstem and a spinal action on the substantia gelatinosa of the dorsal horn . Tramadol is a synthetic opioid pain medication used to treat moderate to moderately severe pain . It exerts its analgesic effects through a variety of different targets on the noradrenergic , serotoninergic and opioid receptors systems . It also exists as a racemic mixture , the positive enantiomer inhibits serotonin reuptake while the negative enantiomer inhibits noradrenaline re-uptake , by binding to and blocking the transporters . Finally , tramadol has also been shown to act as a serotonin releasing agent . Both enantiomers of tramadol are agonists of the μ-opioid receptor and its M1 metabolite , O-demethylate , which is also a μ-opioid receptor agonist but is 6 times more potent than tramadol itself . All these effects work synergistically to induce analgesia . The aim of this study is to examine and compare the effect of both early and late intraperitoneal bupivacaine/tramadol and bupivacaine/dexmedetomedine analgesia on the effectiveness of postoperative analgesia and the requirement of postoperative rescue analgesics after laparoscopic surgery for abdominal cancer surgeries .",2021-03-20,"June 1, 2022","Inclusion Criteria : ASA II or III .

"Insel Gruppe AG, University Hospital Bern",NCT04911660,Impact of the SGLT2 Inhibitor Empagliflozin on Urinary Supersaturations in Kidney Stone Formers,"Insel Gruppe AG, University Hospital Bern",2,1,Kidney Stone,Drug,Empagliflozin 25 MG,Prevention,Quadruple,"The aim of this study is to test the effect of a new drug on the composition of the urine in kidney stone patients . This new drug ( Jardiance® , substance : empagliflozin ) is currently approved in Switzerland for the treatment of patients with diabetes . Data from previous studies with and without diabetes suggest that it may have a beneficial effect on the composition of the urine and thereby reduce the risk of developing kidney stones .","Kidney stones - a global epidemic associated with obesity and diabetes Kidney stones are a worldwide healthcare problem with a current lifetime risk of ~18.8 % in men and ~9.4 % in women in Western civilizations . Recurrence rates are high , up to 40 % and 75 % at 5 and 10 years , respectively . Hospitalizations , surgery and lost work time associated with kidney stones cause enormous healthcare-related expenditures . Although kidney stone disease is traditionally considered an isolated renal disorder , there is overwhelming evidence that it is in fact a systemic disease . Arterial hypertension , obesity , diabetes mellitus , gouty diathesis , dyslipidemia , cardiovascular disease , chronic kidney disease and low bone mass are much more prevalent in kidney stone formers than in non-stone formers . It is currently unknown if stone disease is a cause of this co-morbidity per se or if it is a consequence of the same underlying conditions that lead to these disorders and kidney stones . Clearly , however , these co-morbidities contribute significantly to stone-related morbidity and mortality . The strong , positive and independent association of Body Mass Index ( BMI ) with kidney stone disease is well established . The magnitude of the increased risk is larger in women than in men . In addition to BMI , significant weight gain is also associated with a greater risk of developing symptomatic kidney stone disease in the future . In recent decades , the prevalence of both kidney stone disease and obesity increased significantly , irrespective of age , sex and race . In large cross-sectional analyses , the prevalence of both symptomatic and asymptomatic kidney stones increased proportionally with the number of metabolic syndrome features present . Both calcium and uric acid stones are associated with obesity , but the ratio of calcium stones to uric acid stones is lower in obese compared to non-obese stone formers , suggesting a disproportionate increase of uric acid stone disease in obesity . Absolute urinary excretion rates of stone formation promoters ( calcium , phosphate , oxalate and uric acid ) as well as urinary supersaturation ratios for calcium oxalate and uric acid are increased in obese individuals . In addition , there is a well documented negative association of BMI with urinary pH in both stone formers and non-stone formers , and low urinary pH is the main driver of uric acid stone formation . The latter may be explained by insulin resistance which affects the generation of renal ammonium by direct and indirect mechanisms . In contrast to urinary pH , urinary calcium excretion ( the main driver for calcium stone formation ) is not independently associated with BMI but rather due to other factors known to affect urinary calcium excretion ( e.g . secondary to increased sodium and animal protein intake ) . Supersaturation - driver of kidney stone formation Supersaturation , the presence of a material in solution at a concentration above its own solubility , is the driving force for crystallization and therefore kidney stone formation . Relevant supersaturations for kidney stones disease in humans include calcium oxalate , brushite ( calcium phosphate ) and uric acid . At a supersaturation 1 , crystals form . Urinary supersaturations calculated from ambulatory 24 h urine collections accurately reflect the long-term average supersaturation values in the urine and are highly correlated with the kidney stone composition encountered in the individual kidney stone former . Treatments that reduced stone events in Randomized Controlled Trials ( RCTs ) are highly correlated with reductions in urinary supersaturations . A recent analysis of a large 5-year kidney stone RCT revealed that as early as 1 week after randomization , every 10 % reduction of urinary calcium oxalate supersaturation from baseline was associated with an 8 % reduction in the risk of stone recurrence during follow-up . SGLT2 inhibitors - a promising new drug class for kidney stone formers Inhibitors of the sodium/glucose co-transporter isoform 2 ( SLC5A2 or SGLT2 ) belong to a new class of oral hypoglycemic drugs . SGLT2 resides in the brush border membrane of proximal tubular cells in the kidney and reabsorbs ~90 % of glucose filtered at the glomerulus . SGLT2 inhibitors block the physiological glucose reabsorption in the proximal tubule from the glomerular filtrate , thereby inducing significant glucosuria accompanied by a reduction of blood glucose levels . Empagliflozin , the clinically best characterized SGLT2 inhibitor to date , decreases cardiovascular mortality , death from any cause , hospitalizations for heart failure , decline of GFR and need for renal replacement therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes . Some of these findings were also observed with two other SGLT2 inhibitors canagliflozin and dapagliflozin in large outcome trials . Due to their unique mode of action , SGLT2 inhibitors induce weight loss , decrease blood pressure and increase urinary volume , the latter being a very effective measure to reduce stone recurrence . Driven by promising results in RCTs , SGLT2 inhibitors are currently widely tested in non-diabetics e.g . for the treatment of heart failure , non-diabetic kidney disease , arterial hypertension or obesity ( www.clinicaltrials.gov ) . The pleiotropic beneficial effects make SGLT2 inhibitors also a very attractive class of drugs for kidney stone formers , which often suffer concomitantly from arterial hypertension , CKD , obesity and diabetes . Effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on bone fractures , mineral metabolism and kidney stone events Therapy with SGLT2 inhibitors as monotherapy or add-on therapy to various glucose-lowering agents is generally well tolerated . An increased incidence of genital infections and ( although rare ) euglycemic ketoacidosis are known side effects of this new class of medications . The latter is mainly observed in type I diabetics and less frequently in type II diabetics . To the best of our knowledge , no cases of euglycemic ketoacidosis in individuals without diabetes treated with SGLT2 inhibitors have been reported . In the large canagliflozin outcome study CANVAS , an increased incidence of lower extremity amputations was noted . This adverse effect has not been reported with other SGLT2 inhibitors . In addition , both canagliflozin and dapagliflozin have been associated with an increased risk of bone fractures compared to placebo . In a short term study in healthy volunteers , canagliflozin increased serum phosphate , plasma fibroblast growth factor 23 ( FGF23 ) and plasma parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) and decreased the level of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. Similar results were obtained in individuals with diabetes treated with dapagliflozin . In contrast , pooled analyses of phase I , II and III trials of patients with type 2 diabetes treated with empagliflozin encompassing > 15'000 patient-years of exposure did not reveal an increased rate of bone fractures , alterations of blood electrolytes , PTH , 25-dihydroxyvitamin D or bone turnover markers . While blood electrolyte and mineral metabolism parameters in patients treated with SGLT2 inhibitors have been well studied in healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes , there is a lack of data on the impact of SGLT2 inhibition on urinary parameters , especially on parameters that influence the kidney stone formation rate . Also , to our knowledge , no studies have been conducted thus far with SGLT2 inhibitors in kidney stone formers . Interestingly , in pooled analyses of phase I , II and III trials , the rate of kidney stone events tended to be 30-50 % lower in patients treated with 10 or 25 mg empagliflozin versus placebo . However , detailed analyses for kidney stone events in empagliflozin outcome trials have not been reported . Reported stone event rates in these pooled empagliflozin trials ( 0.5 - 1/100 person years ) are similar to what has been observed in individuals with diabetes in three large prospective US cohorts ( Nurses ' Health Study I , the Nurses ' Health Study II and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study . In contrast , stone event rates are considerably ( 10 - 100-fold ) higher in patients with a history of kidney stone disease . RCTs testing dietary or pharmacologic measures for recurrence prevention typically included patients with stone event rates between 20 and 200 events/100 person-years . In summary , SGLT2 inhibitors represent a promising new drug class for kidney stone formers . Kidney stone formers are likely to profit from the metabolic and cardiovascular effects of SGLT2 inhibition . In addition , SGLT2 inhibitors may decrease the stone formation rate . Based on the overall experience thus far , empagliflozin seems to have by far the most favorable side effect profile . Clearly , there is a dire need for clinical studies with SGLT2 inhibitors in kidney stone formers .",2021-05-06,"May 11, 2023","Inclusion Criteria : Informed Consent as documented by signature Age between 18 and 74 years old One or more kidney stone event ( s ) in the past Any past kidney stone containing ≥ 80 % of calcium or ≥ 80 % of uric acid HbA1c < 6.5 % Exclusion Criteria : Patients with secondary causes of recurrent nephrolithiasis : Severe eating disorders ( anorexia or bulimia ) Chronic bowel disease , past intestinal or bariatric surgery Sarcoidosis Primary hyperparathyroidism Complete distal tubular acidosis Patients with the following medications : Anti-diabetic treatment ( insulin and non-insulin agents ) Patients not able or not willing to stop the following medication during the period of participation in the trial ( including a time window of 4 weeks wash out prior to randomization ) : Diuretics ( thiazide and loop diuretics ) Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors ( including topiramate ) Xanthine oxidase inhibitors Alkali , including potassium citrate or sodium bicarbonate Treatment with 1,25-OH Vitamin D ( calcitriol ) Calcium supplementation Bisphosphonates , Denosumab , Teriparatide Glucocorticoids Obstructive uropathy , if not treated successfully Genito-urinary infection , if not treated successfully Chronic kidney disease ( defined as CKD-EPI eGFR < 60 mL/min per 1.73 m2 body surface area ) Kidney transplant Pregnant and lactating women [ urine pregnancy test to be performed for women of childbearing potential ( defined as women who are not surgically sterilized/ hysterectomized , and/ or who are postmenopausal for less than 12 months ) ] or women of childbearing potential that refuse to use an effective contraceptive method ( birth control pill or IUD ) .

COVID-19 appears to be a disease with an early phase where the virus replicates , coinciding with first presentation of symptoms , followed by a later 'inflammatory ' phase which results in severe disease in some individuals . It is known from other rapidly progressive infections such as sepsis and influenza that early treatment with antimicrobials is associated with better outcome . The hypothesis is that this holds for COVID-19 and that early antiviral treatment may prevent progression to the later phase of the disease . The plan is to conduct a proof-of-principle placebo-controlled clinical trial of favipiravir plus or minus nitazoxanide in health workers , their household members and IMSS beneficiaries . Participants with or without symptomatic COVID-19 or tested positive will be assigned to receive favipiravir plus nitazoxanide or favipiravir plus nitazoxanide placebo . The primary outcome will be the difference in the amount of virus ( 'viral load ' ) in the upper respiratory tract after 5 days of therapy . Secondary outcomes will include hospitalization , major morbidity and mortality , pharmacokinetics , and impact of antiviral therapy on viral genetic mutation rate .

University of Ibadan,NCT04858074,Study to Investigate the Effect of Hypoestes Rosea Powder in Parkinson's Disease,University of Ibadan,1,1,Parkinson Disease,Drug,Hypoestoxide,Treatment,Double,"Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) is a progressive neurological disease characterized by resting tremors , limb stiffness , impaired balance , and slow movement . There is no known cure for PD although levo-3,4 dihydroxyphenylalanine ( L-DOPA ) and dopamine agonists are effective for improving PD symptoms in the early years following diagnosis . Hypoestes rosea is an evergreen shrub which has anti-inflammatory , anticancer and antimalarial properties . Recent studies showed that the active pharmaceutical ingredient ( API ) of Hypoestes rosea , Hypoestoxide , was effective in modifying disease progression in a transgenic mouse model of PD . The aim of this study is to determine the efficacy of Hypoestoxide , as contained in Hypoestes rosea dry leaf powder , in improving motor symptoms in consenting PD patients . The study design is a double-blind , placebo-controlled cross-over trial involving 30 patients with mild to moderate disease ( Stages 1-3 of Hoehn and Yahr scale over an 8-week period . The symptoms of the participants will be monitored using mobile phones with an established quantitative assessment tool , mPower2.0 , which was previously developed for monitoring symptoms and disease progression in PD patients . In addition , the motor examination component of the International Movement Disorders Society scale will be administered and correlated with the finding on the mobile phone . The outcome measure is an improvement in the motor variables of the study participants with a 10 % change from baseline over the 8 weeks of using Hypoestes .","Justification Age-associated disorders are increasing in many low- and middle-income countries due to population ageing and changing lifestyles . PD is a devastating condition which , in the advanced stages , is associated with immobility and uncontrollable tremors . Life then becomes miserable for the sufferers . Unfortunately , there is no cure for the disease except control of symptoms with medications . Any treatment combination that leads to better symptom control will go a long way in improving the quality of life for PD patients . This proof-of-concept study ( POC ) , if successful will give a new lease on life to PD patients . Hence it is considered worthwhile to treat PD patients with a new compound that is contained in a local plant that is readily available and holds promise for efficacy based on its mode of action specifically in reducing the formation of alpha synuclein which underlies the neuronal death in PD . OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY The aim of this study is to determine the efficacy of Hypoestoxide , as contained in Hypoestes rosea dry leaf powder ( PECKO-D ) , in improving motor symptoms in consenting PD patients over an 8-week period . Specific Objectives : • To determine the efficacy of Hypoestes rosea in improving motor performance of PD patients through traditional clinical evaluation , use of the selected components of the Motor Examination section of the International Movement Disorders Society Scale and ActiGraph wearable as a quantitative assessment tool . To document the side effect profile of the herbal product Methodology Study site : University College Hospital , Ibadan Study design : Single-center , randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial Study Type : Interventional ( Clinical Trial ) Allocation : Randomized Masking : Double Primary Purpose : Treatment Study participants : Patients with mild to moderate Parkinson 's disease symptoms . Eligibility Criteria Ages eligible for study : 30 years and older ( Adult , older adult ) Sexes Eligible for Study : All Accepts healthy volunteers : No Sample size : Being a proof-of-concept study , 19 PD patients will participate in this phase of the study Inclusion criteria : • Willing and able to give informed consent . Willingness and ability to comply with study requirements . PD diagnosis must be confirmed by bradykinesia plus one of the other cardinal signs ( resting tremor , rigidity , postural instability ) being present . Age > 30 years Men and women with mild to moderate PD : Hoehn and Yahr scale stages 1 - 3 . Participants may be on current therapeutic agents ( including levodopa , dopamine agonists , anticholinergics , amantadine or selegiline ) to treat PD symptoms at the time of enrollment and may remain on these agents throughout the 5-month study period . Women of childbearing potential ( i.e. , those not postmenopausal or surgically sterile ) may participate provided that they are using adequate birth control methods for the duration of the study . Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at baseline and be non-lactating . Exclusion : Subjects with advanced , severe disease , including those with dementia , severe osteoarthritis , allergies , stroke , and visual impairment . Presence of atypical PD syndromes due to drugs ( e.g. , metoclopramide , flunarizine ) , metabolic identified neurogenetic disorders ( e.g. , Wilson 's disease ) , encephalitis , or other degenerative diseases ( e.g. , progressive supranuclear palsy ) . Any clinically significant medical condition ( e.g. , active neoplasm , angina ) or laboratory abnormality , which would in the judgement of the investigator interfere with the subjects ' ability to participate in the study or be followed . Study Procedure : In this study , participants with mild to moderate PD , whether treated or untreated , will be randomized into one of two study arms following an initial baseline assessment to determine motor activity status of each participant as follows : Baseline Determination : Measurement of motor activities of all participants will be determined for 3 weeks while on regular PD medication ( s ) . The International Movement Disorders Society Scale - Motor Examination ( 10 selected items on Slowness , Posture , Tremor , Rigidity and Gait ) will be utilized for the quantitation of the motor activities . Drug arm : 15 patients will receive 4 capsules each containing 350 mg orally twice a day of PECKO-D Forte for 8 weeks as add-on therapy to patients ' regular PD medication ( s ) . Placebo arm : 15 participants will receive 4 capsules orally twice a day of United States Pharmacopeia ( USP ) -grade starch for 8 weeks as add-on to regular PD medication ( s ) . Wash-Out : Wash-out will be for a duration of 4 weeks in which patients assigned to both arms will take no capsules . The Switch over : Following the wash-out period , the PECKO-D Forte group will receive 4 capsules of USP-grade starch powder taken orally twice a day for 8 weeks . The placebo group will receive 4 capsules of PECKO-D forte taken orally twice a day for 8 weeks . Symptoms of the participants will be monitored using traditional clinical evaluation and daily using ActiGraph as an established quantitative assessment tool Once enrolled and given the ActiGraph kit , the participants will be asked to perform four ( 4 ) separate study tasks daily during the baseline determination period and throughout the treatment period : gait , tremor , tapping and balance . The International Movement Disorders Society Scale ( MDS ) - Motor Examination ( 10 selected items on Slowness , Posture , Tremor , Rigidity and Gait ) will be utilized for the quantitation of the motor activities . Data collected using the ActiGraph will be computer-analyzed and the MDS - Motor items will then be analyzed for significant changes in symptom severity relative to baseline status . Measurements : These include compliance , gait and balance measures before , during , and after treatment with PECKO-D . Participants will remain on their standard of care PD medications throughout the POC study and possible adverse side effects of the PEKO-D will be monitored . The following variables will be documented for each of these key measures : i ) Compliance : hours of device worn per day hours of device wear compliance per week hours of device worn per treatment period hours of device worn over the course of the study ii ) Gait measures : start time of walking period in milliseconds end time of walking period in milliseconds Duration of walking period in seconds Distance walked per walking period in meters Average gait speed per walking period in meters Number of steps per walking period Average stride period per walking period in seconds Freeze index per walking period iii ) Balance measures per detected walking period : X ( lateral ) axis variability in g Y ( forward ) axis variability in g Z ( vertical ) axis variability in g X-Y ( horizontal ) variability in g Freeze Index ( ratio ) OUTCOME MEASURE : 10 % Mean change in motor assessment parameters using the International Movement Disorders Society Scale - selected motor examination items while on the Hypoestes . This equates to 1- to 2-point improvement in motor performance over a 2-month period on Hypoestes in the absence of side effects which will be monitored using pharmacovigilance tools .

Posture : Instructions to examiner : Posture is assessed with the patient standing erect after arising from a chair , during walking , and while being tested for postural reflexes . If you notice poor posture , tell the patient to stand up straight and see if the posture improves ( see option 2 below ) . Rate the worst posture seen in these three observation points . Observe for flexion and side-to-side leaning . 0 : Normal : No problems . Slight : Not quite erect , but posture could be normal for older person . Mild : Definite flexion , scoliosis or leaning to one side , but patient can correct posture to normal posture when asked to do so . Moderate : Stooped posture , scoliosis or leaning to one side that can not be corrected volitionally to a normal posture by the patient . Severe : Flexion , scoliosis or leaning with extreme abnormality of posture . 2 . Global spontaneity of movement ( body bradykinesia ) Instructions to examiner : This global rating combines all observations on slowness , hesitancy , and small amplitude and poverty of movement in general , including a reduction of gesturing and of crossing the legs . This assessment is based on the examiner 's global impression after observing for spontaneous gestures while sitting , and the nature of arising and walking . 0 : Normal : No problems . Slight : Slight global slowness and poverty of spontaneous movements . Mild : Mild global slowness and poverty of spontaneous movements . Moderate : Moderate global slowness and poverty of spontaneous movements . Severe : Severe global slowness and poverty of spontaneous movements . 3 . Rigidity : Instructions to examiner : Rigidity is judged on slow passive movement of major joints with the patient in a relaxed position and the examiner manipulating the limbs and neck . First , test without an activation maneuver . Test and rate neck and each limb separately . For arms , test the wrist and elbow joints simultaneously . For legs , test the hip and knee joints simultaneously . If no rigidity is detected , use an activation maneuver such as tapping fingers , fist opening/closing , or heel tapping in a limb not being tested . Explain to the patient to go as limp as possible as you test for rigidity . 0 : Normal : No rigidity . Slight : Rigidity only detected with activation maneuver . Mild : Rigidity detected without the activation maneuver , but full range of motion is easily achieved . Moderate : Rigidity detected without the activation maneuver ; full range of motion is achieved with effort . Severe : Rigidity detected without the activation maneuver and full range of motion not achieved . 4 . Finger tapping : Instructions to examiner : Each hand is tested separately . Demonstrate the task , but do not continue to perform the task while the patient is being tested . Instruct the patient to tap the index finger on the thumb 10 times as quickly AND as big as possible . Rate each side separately , evaluating speed , amplitude , hesitations , halts , and decrementing amplitude . 0 : Normal : No problems . Slight : Any of the following : a ) the regular rhythm is broken with one or two interruptions or hesitations of the tapping movement ; b ) slight slowing ; c ) the amplitude decrements near the end of the 10 taps . Mild : Any of the following : a ) 3 to 5 interruptions during tapping ; b ) mild slowing ; c ) the amplitude decrements midway in the 10-tap sequence . Moderate : Any of the following : a ) more than 5 interruptions during tapping or at least one longer arrest ( freeze ) in ongoing movement ; b ) moderate slowing ; c ) the amplitude decrements starting after the 1st tap . Severe : Can not or can only barely perform the task because of slowing , interruptions , or decrements . 5 . Toe tapping Instructions to examiner : Have the patient sit in a straight-backed chair with arms , both feet on the floor . Test each foot separately . Demonstrate the task , but do not continue to perform the task while the patient is being tested . Instruct the patient to place the heel on the ground in a comfortable position and then tap the toes 10 times as big and as fast as possible . Rate each side separately , evaluating speed , amplitude , hesitations , halts , and decrementing amplitude . 0 : Normal : No problems . Slight : Any of the following : a ) the regular rhythm is broken with one or two interruptions or hesitations of the tapping movement ; b ) slight slowing ; c ) amplitude decrements near the end of the ten taps . Mild : Any of the following : a ) 3 to 5 interruptions during the tapping movements ; b ) mild slowing ; c ) amplitude decrements midway in the task . Moderate : Any of the following : a ) more than 5 interruptions during the tapping movements or at least one longer arrest ( freeze ) in ongoing movement ; b ) moderate slowing ; c ) amplitude decrements after the 1st tap . Severe : Can not or can only barely perform the task because of slowing , interruptions or decrements . 6 . Arising from a chair Instructions to examiner : Have the patient sit in a straight-backed chair with arms , with both feet on the floor and sitting back in the chair ( if the patient is not too short ) . Ask the patient to cross his/her arms across the chest and then to stand up . If the patient is not successful , repeat this attempt up to a maximum of two more times . If still unsuccessful , allow the patient to move forward in the chair to arise with arms folded across the chest . Allow only one attempt in this situation . If unsuccessful , allow the patient to push off using his/her hands on the arms of the chair . Allow a maximum of three trials of pushing off . If still not successful , assist the patient to arise . After the patient stands up , observe the posture . 0 : Normal : No problems . Able to arise quickly without hesitation . Slight : Arising is slower than normal ; or may need more than one attempt ; or may need to move forward in the chair to arise . No need to use the arms of the chair . Mild : Pushes self up from the arms of the chair without difficulty . Moderate : Needs to push off but tends to fall back ; or may have to try more than one time using the arms of the chair but can get up without help . Severe : Unable to arise without help . 7 . Gait Instructions to examiner : Testing gait is best performed by having the patient walking away from and towards the examiner so that both right and left sides of the body can be easily observed simultaneously . The patient should walk at least 10 meters ( 30 feet ) , then turn around and return to the examiner . This item measures multiple behaviors : stride amplitude , stride speed , height of foot lift , heel strike during walking , turning , and arm swing , but not freezing . Observe posture for item 1 0 : Normal : No problems . Slight : Independent walking with minor gait impairment . Mild : Independent walking but with substantial gait impairment . Moderate : Requires an assistance device for safe walking ( walking stick , walker ) but not a person . Severe : Can not walk at all or only with another person 's assistance . 8 . Postural Stability Instructions to examiner : The test examines the response to sudden body displacement produced by a quick , forceful pull on the shoulders while the patient is standing erect with eyes open and feet comfortably apart and parallel to each other . Test retropulsion . Stand behind the patient and instruct the patient on what is about to happen . Explain that s/he is allowed to take a step backwards to avoid falling . There should be a solid wall behind the examiner , at least 1-2 meters away to allow for the observation of the number of retropulsive steps . The first pull is an instructional demonstration and is purposely milder and not rated . The second time the shoulders are pulled briskly and forcefully towards the examiner with enough force to displace the center of gravity so that patient MUST take a step backwards . The examiner needs to be ready to catch the patient but must stand sufficiently back so as to allow enough room for the patient to take several steps to recover independently . Do not allow the patient to flex the body abnormally forward in anticipation of the pull . Observe for the number of steps backwards or falling . Up to and including two steps for recovery is considered normal , so abnormal ratings begin with three steps . If the patient fails to understand the test , the examiner can repeat the test so that the rating is based on an assessment that the examiner feels reflects the patient 's limitations rather than misunderstanding or lack of preparedness . Observe standing posture . 0 : Normal : No problems . Recovers with one or two steps . Slight : 3-5 steps , but subject recovers unaided . Mild : More than 5 steps , but subject recovers unaided . Moderate : Stands safely , but with absence of postural response ; falls if not caught by examiner . Severe : Very unstable , tends to lose balance spontaneously or with just a gentle pull on the shoulders . 9 . Rest tremor amplitude Instructions to examiner : This and the next item have been placed purposefully at the end of the examination to allow the rater to gather observations on rest tremor that may appear at any time during the exam , including when quietly sitting , during walking , and during activities when some body parts are moving but others are at rest . Score the maximum amplitude that is seen at any time as the final score . Rate only the amplitude and not the persistence or the intermittency of the tremor . As part of this rating , the patient should sit quietly in a chair with the hands placed on the arms of the chair ( not in the lap ) and the feet comfortably supported on the floor for 10 seconds with no other directives . Rest tremor is assessed separately for all four limbs and also for the lip/jaw . Rate only the maximum amplitude that is seen at any time as the final rating . Extremity ratings 0 : Normal : No tremor . Slight : < 1 cm in maximal amplitude . Mild : ≥ 1 cm but < 3 cm in maximal amplitude . Moderate : ≥ 3 cm but 75 % of the entire examination period .

Data entery specialist Statistical Analysis Sample size : 1500 volanteer ( 750 in each group ) . We are planning a study of independent 2 groups with 1 control ( s ) per case . Prior data indicate that the incidence of infection among controls is 15 % . If the true incidence of infection rate for experimental subjects is 10 % , we will need to study 686 experimental subjects and 686 control subjects to be able to reject the null hypothesis that the failure rates for experimental and control subjects are equal with probability ( power ) 0.8 . The Type I error probability associated with this test of this null hypothesis is 0.05 . Based on this calculation , a total of 750 subject in each group will be calculated to compensate for the droup outs . Statistical methods The data will be analyzed by SPSS V. 23 ( SPSS Inc . Released 2015 . IBM SPSS statistics for windows , version 23.0 , Armnok , NY : IBM Corp. ) . Data will be expressed in Number ( No ) , percentage ( % ) mean ( x̅ ) , and standard deviation ( SD ) . OneWay ANOVA is a test of significance that will be used for comparison of quantitative variables of normally distributed data . In contrast , the Kruskal-Wallis test will be used for the comparison of quantitative variables between three groups of not normally distributed data . Primary efficacy analysis will be on an intention-to-treat basis and will include all the persons who will be randomized . The time to clinical improvement will be described by Kaplan-Meier plot and compared with a log-rank test . Hazard ratios with 95 % confidence intervals will be calculated through the Cox proportional-hazards model . Equipment All participating centers are well equipped with the necessary equipment ; either for patients care , laboratory testing , or radiology services . Cofedinitiality : A . Protection of Subject Privacy - All volunteers are assured of their confidentiality both verbally and in the informed consent forms . The facilities are strictly limited to the staff of the research institution , clinics and to research volunteers . This is accomplished by a variety of stringent security measures .

University of Pittsburgh,NCT04790786,"UPMC OPTIMISE-C19 Trial, a COVID-19 Study",Erin McCreary,4,0,Covid19,Biological,Lilly Bamlanivimab,Other,,"Multiple monoclonal antibodies ( mABs ) have been shown to reduce viral burden and improve clinical outcomes , have been granted FDA Emergency Use Authorization ( EUA ) for use in select populations , and are routinely used in the UPMC Health System , which has made expanded access a priority . However , the comparative effectiveness of these mABS is unknown . The National Academies of Sciences , Engineering , and Medicine has called for expanded access and clinical use of mABs , noting it is `` critical to collect data and evaluate whether they are working as predicted '' . This pragmatic evaluation will determine the relative effects of the EUA-governed mABs versus each other . When U.S. government mAB policies change ( e.g. , FDA grants or revokes EUAs ) , UPMC Health System policies and the evaluated mABs will accordingly change .","While COVID-19 vaccination will reduce COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality , the learned immune response may vary between individuals . This means interventions such as monoclonal antibodies ( mAB ) will still be needed to prevent progression of COVID-19 illness . Monoclonal antibodies seek to mimic or enhance the natural immune system response against a pathogen and are often used in the care of patients with cancer or infection . For viral infections , mABs are created by exposing a white blood cell to a particular viral protein , which is then cloned to mass produce antibodies to target that virus . For SARS-CoV-2 , the virus that causes COVID-19 , IgG1 mABs target the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and block viral attachment and entry into cells . The SARS-CoV-2 mABs bamlanivimab and etesevimab , and the REGN-COV2 combination ( casirivimab + imdevimab ) reduce nasopharyngeal viral burden plus clinical outcomes including future emergency department visits and hospitalizations . Each received FDA Emergency Use Authorization ( EUA ) for use in selected populations . As of February 2021 , there are over 60,000 new cases of COVID-19 diagnosed daily in the US , with over 7000 daily COVID-19 related hospital admissions . Although case volumes are currently declining , COVID-19 remains a significant public health threat . Despite the EUAs , the clinical use of mABs is low due in part to lack of patient access , complexities in drug allocation , and lack of knowledge among providers are contributing factors . Further , the comparative effectiveness of different mABs is unknown and not yet directly studied . The National Academies of Sciences , Engineering , and Medicine recently called for expanded access and clinical use of mABs , noting it is `` critical to collect data and evaluate whether they are working as predicted '' . This evaluation seeks to determine their relative effects versus each other , starting with those governed by EUAs . OPTIMISE-C19 is a quality improvement ( QI ) study , governed by approvals from both the UPMC QI committee and the University of Pittsburgh IRB . Currently , mAB therapy is approved for use under EUA issued by the FDA . There are no data on the relative benefits of one mAB versus any other . mABs are ordered by UPMC physicians as a generic referral order and the order is filled by UPMC pharmacy via therapeutic interchange . The selection of mABs available within pharmacy is overseen by the UPMC pharmacy and therapeutics committee . OPTIMISE-C19 provides the therapeutic interchange via random allocation . The UPMC Quality Improvement Committee approved the OPTIMISE-C19 study , including the random therapeutic interchange . The University of Pittsburgh IRB considered the randomized therapeutic interchange to be quality improvement and approved the additional data collection and analyses . Patients provide verbal consent to receive mAB therapy . UPMC requires physicians to provide and review with patients the EUA Fact Sheet for each mAB , and explain that the patient could receive any of the EUA-governed mABs . As per EUA requirements , physicians discuss the risks and benefits of mABs with patients , and patients consent to receive a mAB as part of routine care , should they desire mAB treatment . Patients are told which mAB they are receiving , and physicians and patients can agree to the assigned mAB or request a specific mAB . It is the treating physicians ' and patients ' choice to accept the assigned mAB or not . The QI committee considered these steps to represent adequate consent to participate . The IRB considered that the provision of mAB therapy therefore fell under quality improvement and only the additional data collection and analyses represented research . The IRB waived any additional consent requirements .",2021-02-26,"May 21, 2023",Inclusion Criteria : COVID-19 positive patients Eligible for mAB under FDA EUA Exclusion Criteria : Death is deemed to be imminent or inevitable Previous participation in this REMAP within the last 90 days,4571,0,12 Years,120 Years

Without treatment , it can lead to severe visual impairment . Recurrence is the commonest complication and novel treatment approaches are crucial to prevent vision loss . The biological processes underlying the formation of pterygium are complex , but central to its pathogenesis is the angiogenic cytokine vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) . VEGF is upregulated under conditions of increased oxidative stress , which plays an integral role in pterygium development ( Cardenas-Cantu et al. , 2016 , Karaman , 2018 , Norrby , 1998 , Rossino et al. , 2020 , Shibunya , 2011 ) .Various biomarkers on pterygium have been identified and are useful to determine the effectiveness of new modality treatment for pterygium . These markers can be identified via histopathological stain such as Masson Trichrome to observe changes of collagen fibres . Other identifiable markers include the use of special immunohistochemical stain such as anti CD34 antibody for microvascular density and anti-8-OHdG antibody for oxidative changes in the pterygium tissue . By analyzing the changes with or without Ranibizumab injection in addition to observation of clinical recurrence rate of pterygium , we are able to conclude the effectiveness of anti-VEGF on pterygium recurrence . The aim of the study was to evaluate the association between collagen fibres changes , microvascular density changes and inflammation resultant from oxidative stress with the clinical recurrence of pterygium following intralesional Ranibizumab injection in comparison to control group .","This is a prospective interventional study conducted from May 2018 to April 2020 . Patients with primary pterygium who attended eye clinic Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia ( HUSM ) Kubang Kerian , Kelantan and fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria were recruited as participants of this study . Convenient sampling method was applied for participants ' recruitment where all patients will be given thorough explanation in regards to the study and subsequently divided into interventional and control group . Intervention group participants were given intralesional Ranibizumab ( 0.5mg/ 0.05mL ) 2 weeks prior to pterygium excision surgery . Both groups of participants undergo pterygium excision with autologous conjunctival graft surgery thereafter . Excised pterygium tissues were sent to the laboratory for slide preparation and staining with specific reagents including Masson Trichrome for collagen fibers , anti CD34 antibody for microvascular density and anti-8 OHdG antibody for oxidative stress changes . Slides were then analysed by the pathologist and statistical analysis of the results were carried out with the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences ( SPSS ) Version 26.0 .

The study is designed to test the requirements of predicted N. gonorrhoeae virulence determinants for gonococcal infection in the male urethra through infection with engineered mutants of N. gonorrhoeae . We predict that mutations abolishing expression of N. gonorrhoeae virulence determinants will eliminate or significantly reduce gonococcal infectivity or the ability to induce inflammation in an infected individual , thus identifying potential vaccine candidates . Study duration will be 1 year , and the duration for all participants will be about 3 weeks . The primary objective of the study is to compare the ability of different engineered mutants of Neisseria gonorrhoeae to cause a clinical infection ( signs or symptoms of urethritis such as discomfort during urination , urethral discharge , etc . ) in the male urethra .","This is a Phase 1 , interventional , non-randomized , experimental infection model study in healthy adult males ( N=up to 25 ) between the ages of 18-35 at study enrollment . The study is designed to test the requirements of predicted N. gonorrhoeae virulence determinants for gonococcal infection in the male urethra through infection with engineered mutants of N. gonorrhoeae . We hypothesize that key virulence determinants involved in N. gonorrhoeae adherence and resistance to innate immunity are essential for infection in the male urethra . We predict that mutations abolishing expression of these virulence determinants will eliminate or significantly reduce gonococcal infectivity or the ability to induce inflammation in an infected individual , thus identifying potential vaccine candidates . For each mutant to be investigated under this protocol , initial trials will be conducted in which subjects receive a bacterial inoculum containing a mixture of equivalent numbers of two isogenic strains , differing in expression of one or more genes . A competitive advantage for one strain during urethral infection will be manifest by recovery of that strain in a statistically significantly higher proportion of isolates recovered from infected subjects than in the inoculum . Following infections with mixed inocula , infectivity of the mutant in single-strain infections will be compared to that of the wild-type in single-strain infections . In addition , the proportion of infected subjects that develop signs or symptoms of urethritis with mutant and wild- type inocula will be compared . The Mixed FA7527/FA1090 group ( n = up to 25 ) will receive a bacterial inoculum containing a mixture of equivalent numbers of the isogenic mutant and WT strains . In single-strain infections , the Mutant FA7527 group ( n = up to 8 ) will receive a bacterial inoculum containing only the isogenic mutant N. gonorrhoeae strain , and the Wild-type FA1090 group ( n = up to 8 ) will receive a bacterial inoculum containing only the wild-type ( WT ) N. gonorrhoeae strain . All subjects will be examined daily for symptoms of infection and receive antibiotic treatment at the end of the inpatient portion of the trial . Study duration will be 1 year , and the duration for all participants will be about 3 weeks . The primary objective of the study is to compare the ability of different engineered mutants of Neisseria gonorrhoeae to cause a clinical infection ( signs or symptoms of urethritis such as discomfort during urination , urethral discharge , etc . ) in the male urethra . The study secondary objectives are to : ( 1 ) characterize host immune responses to infection by measuring cytokines and other mediators in specimens including serum , peripheral blood lymphocytes and urine obtained from subjects before , during and after experimental gonococcal infection , and ( 2 ) characterize bacterial gene expression during experimental infection .",2021-04-29,"November 2, 2021","Inclusion Criteria : Healthy man between the ages of 18 and 35 years .

Universidad de Colima,NCT05562401,Effect of Coconut Water on Hydration Status in Pediatric Population,Universidad de Colima,4,1,Sports Nutrition,Device,Coconut Water,Prevention,Double,"Introduction : The dehydration is a very common problem that is often not identified . The pediatric population is more susceptible to dehydration due to its physiological characteristics . Proper hydration is crucial for health since any degree of dehydration causes a reduction in physical and mental work capacity , hence the importance of preventing it by considering the type of drink . There are multiple beverage options , including industrial oral electrolytes ( OE ) , on the other hand , coconut water ( CW ) has been studied as a natural alternative beverage with characteristics that can help maintain a state of euhydration . Objective : To determine if AC has a greater effect on hydration status than OE in adolescents who perform physical exercise . Material and methods : RCT , double blind . 34 subjects aged 13.02 ± 1.08 years were selected , assigned to treatment with either OE ( Electrolit® ) or CW . They received a weekly physical exercise session ( 4 weeks ) . Hydration was personalized ( ml x kilograms of weight ) and hydration was evaluated by Urine Specific Gravity ( USG ) , Total Body Water ( TBW ) by bioimpedance and changes in body mass . Results : There were no significant differences in hydration in the first 3 exercise sessions ( p > 0.05 ) , however , in the last session there was a significant difference between treatments ( p=0.003 ) . Conclusion : AC and OE have the same effect on hydration levels in adolescents who perform physical exercise .","For current epidemiological reasons of Covid-19 , an increase of 30 % of losses has been considered already established in the sample size , giving a total of 22 participants per group ( 44 in total ) . For the same reason , two groups of 22 participants ( 11 experimental and 11 controls ) will be divided in order to reduce the population and the risk of contagion , following the health protocols established by the institution mentioned in Annex 2 . The type of randomization to be used in the study will be based on the assigned treatment ( A / B ) by the balanced block method . This method consists of assembling a series of blocks , made up of a certain number of cells , in which the different types of treatment are included . The number of blocks will be determined by the number of participants to be included and the number of cells that it has been decided to include in each block , so in the present study 12 blocks with four treatment cells will be placed , giving a total of 44 treatments to the same as the number of study subjects . Each block will contain in each cell one of the treatment alternatives and within each block there must be a balanced number of possible treatments . Treatments A and B will be written in blocks ( 22 with treatment A and 22 with treatment B ) . The randomization will be carried out by a person external to the study and the same person will be the one who will randomly assign the treatments in the blocks and the numbering of each block . They will be summoned to 12:00 noon on Monday or Tuesday only according to the group assigned to start with the collection of personal data ( Annex 3 ) and a mental test called Psychological Characteristics related to Sports Performance ( CPRD ) ( Annex 4 ) which will be applied by an expert in the area of psychology , in addition , if training is required for the application of the test , the main researcher will be trained to be able to perform it properly . After taking personal data , hydrating drinks will be administered immediately before training ( 7 ml x kg of weight ) 4 hours before . At 2:00 p.m. , your corresponding hydrating drink ( 4 ml x kg of weight ) will be administered again . Each participant will have a 600 ml graduated glass that will be granted by the researcher to keep track of the drink administered at the different times of each session . Immediately afterwards , the anthropometry and urine sample will be taken . To record body mass , the protocol developed by the International Society for the Advancement of Kinanthropometry ( ISAK ) will be followed . The study subjects will be weighed in sports shorts and barefoot before starting physical exercise , having been told that , in the case of urinating or defecating , they should do so before the initial weigh-in . Simultaneously with taking the body mass , the % ACT will be determined by electrical bioimpedance . To record body mass and % of ACT water , the Tanita BC-533 bioimpedance scale will be used with a reliability of 97 % , precision of 0.1kg and with a measuring range of 0-150kg . Once the anthropometry and urine sample have been taken , a 200 ml dose will be administered immediately before exercise ( 10-15 ) min . They will continue with the physical exercise protocol which will receive a physical exercise session per week ( Tuesdays ) , with a duration of 1 hour and 15 minutes each session . The exercise sessions will be carried out in the Domingo Savio sports fields and will be taught by the principal investigator who has worked as a sports coach in the soccer area for 3 years , in addition to being trained for this purpose in the same institution where he was will carry out the study . Days prior to the start of the practical execution of the protocol , parents and selected students will be summoned to a meeting in order to explain the dynamics that will take place . The physical exercise sessions will consist of 4 parts : The first part of the workout will consist of a 10 minute warm-up and stretching to increase your basal HR and prepare the body for the next high intensity stages and prevent injuries in teens . The warm-up will have a break of 5 minutes and hydration of 2 ml x kg of weight . This second part will take place in 12 min of continuous jogging around the field at an average pace , aiming to do one lap every 1 minute 36 seconds , giving a total of 7 and a half laps to the soccer field ( Cooper 's Test ) . 8 min rest for the total recovery of energy systems and hydration of 2 ml x kg of weight . In the second part of the training , the adolescents must run from one line to another , twenty meters apart , at the pace set by a tape . This race pace will increase every minute . Subjects start the test at a speed of 8 km / hr , the first minute increases to 9 km / hr and thereafter , each minute increases the pace ½ km / hr . The test ends when they can not keep up with the pace set ( Test de course Navette ) . Approximate time 10 min with 8 min rest and hydration of 2 ml x kg of weight . In this last part of the training session , it is a type of exercise based on tabatas , which consists of performing 8 different exercises for 20 seconds per 10 seconds of rest to the rhythm of the marked music , giving a time of 4 minutes per tabata . .2 tabatas will be made with an intermediate rest of 3 min between each tabata and hydration of 2 ml x kg of weight . At the end of this last stage of the training session , anthropometry and information collection will be taken where the percentage of weight change , body composition with bioimpedance will be determined before starting the final hydration , since if it is done at the In reverse , it is very likely that no one will come out in a state of dehydration . After the anthropometry , they will be administered the corresponding post-exercise hydration ( 1.5 ml x kg of weight ) and the urine sample will be collected . In the event that a subject has not urinated due to dehydration , their sterilized bottle will be taken home and the head of research will be notified immediately for its proper conservation or transport . The calculation of the percentage of lost weight will be calculated using the following formula : % Weight Loss or Dehydration = [ ( Initial Weight - Final Weight ) / Initial Weight ] x 100 . As a final point , the data obtained before the exercise will be compared with the data obtained after the exercise , where the euhydration cut-off points will be analyzed to categorize the subject as dehydrated or euhydrated . An effective drink ( CW or OE ) will be considered when any 2 or more indicators ( GEO , ACT or Body Mass ) are consistent with the euhydration thresholds .",2021-12-15,"September 27, 2022","Inclusion Criteria : Students that belong to `` Instituto Salesiano Fray Pedro de Gante '' .

Escalation to the next higher dose level may occur only after evaluation of the safety and PK results of the previous dose level ( at least 6 evaluable subjects ) . Within each cohort , 6 subjects will receive one dose of ASN51 , and 2 subjects will receive one dose of matching placebo . Based on this interim safety evaluation , dose levels may be revised . Part 2 : Multiple ascending oral doses will be administered to 24 healthy elderly subjects ( aged 55 - 80 years , inclusive ) in 3 sequential dosing groups ( 8 subjects in each dosing group ) . Six ( 6 ) subjects will receive ASN51 and two ( 2 ) subjects will receive matching placebo in each dosing group ( cohort ) for 10 days . Escalation to the next higher dose level may occur only after evaluation of the safety and PK results of the previous dose level ( at least 6 evaluable subjects ) . Based on this interim safety evaluation , dose levels may be revised . Treatment of the subjects of each cohort will be administered as follows : Day 1 - 9 : Twice daily ( BID ) dosing ( or once daily ( QD ) dosing ) ; to be defined after Part 1 ( SAD ) of ASN51 or placebo . Day 10 : Only one dose will be administered in the morning of Day 10 Selection of the dosing regimen and dose levels to be administered in Part 2 will be made by the safety review committee ( SRC ) , depending on the results of Part 1 . Part 3 : Multiple oral doses will be administered to 12 AD subjects ( aged 55-85 , inclusive ) in a single dosing group for 10 days . Eight ( 8 ) AD subjects will receive ASN51 and four ( 4 ) AD subjects will receive placebo in that dosing group ( cohort ) . Selection of the dose level to be administered in Part 3 will be made by the SRC and will depend on the results of study Part 1 ( SAD ) and Part 2 ( MAD ) , and will be below the maximum tolerated dose administered to healthy subjects in Part 2 . Treatment of the AD subjects will be administered as follows : Day 1 - 9 : Twice daily ( BID ) dosing ( or once daily ( QD ) dosing ) ; to be defined after Part 2 ( MAD ) of ASN51 or placebo . Day 10 : Only one dose will be administered in the morning of Day 10 .

Bozyaka Training and Research Hospital,NCT04756050,Comparison of Different Approaches for Supraclavicular Block and Their Effects on Diaphragm Muscle Function,Bozyaka Training and Research Hospital,4,1,Phrenic Nerve Paralysis,Drug,Bupivacaine HCl 0.5% Injectable Solution,Treatment,Double,"Brachial plexus blocks used for anesthesia in upper extremity operations can be performed with interscalene , axillary , supraclavicular and infraclavicular approaches . Plexus blockage can be performed under the guidance of needle nerve stimulation , artery palpation or ultrasonography ( USG ) . Nowadays , the simultaneous use of USG during the block allows the protection of structures such as nerves , pleura and vessels , and allows practitioners to see the needle and the spread of local anesthetic during the injection . Although supraclavicular block seems to be advantageous because the brachial plexus is more compact and superficial in this region , it has a disadvantage of being close to the pleura . ( Increased risk of pneumothorax ) With the use of USG , this risk has decreased and the supraclavicular block has become an alternative to infraclavicular block , which is widely used in upper extremity surgery . Due to the compact structure of the brachial plexus trunk at the first rib level , the application of the block is easier and the block formation is faster due to the peripheral spread of the local anesthetic . With the spread of local anesthetic to C3-C5 nerve roots in the brachial plexus , paralysis can be seen in the ipsilateral phrenic nerve up to 67 % . Patients who will be operated on , especially in patients with respiratory distress , may experience respiratory distress due to the dysfunction of that side diaphragm muscle . With the help of ultrasound , the inspiratory and end-expiratory thickness of the diaphragm is measured with the Diaphragm Thickness Index ( DTI ) , which is a new and effective method used as a mechanical ventilator weaning index in intensive care units . With this method , we can examine the effect of phrenic nerve block on diaphragm muscle due to local anesthesia in the acute period . DTI is calculated as a percentage from the following formula : ( Max thickness at the end of inspiration - Max thickness at the end of the expiration ) / Max thickness at the end of the expiration . By comparing 3 different approaches used in supraclavicular block , we aimed to investigate the most appropriate block approach in terms of effectiveness , speed , complication rate , effects on diaphragm and 6 months effects .","In this prospective randomized double-blind study , patients will be divided into 3 groups using a computer program . Standard monitoring ( ECG , pulse oximetry , noninvasive blood pressure ) will be applied to the patients who will then be taken to the block application room . After the peripheral vascular access is established on the hand that will not be operated on , premedication will be provided with 2 mg iv midazolam . The blocks will be performed by an experienced anesthesiologist with the USG guidance . Block evaluation and measurements will be made by a different experienced anesthesiologist . After the antisepsis of the area to be blocked , a 22G 50 mm stimulator needle will be used for the block . Intermittent negative aspiration will be performed during all procedures to detect possible vascular puncture . The local anesthetic mixture we routinely use in our clinic will be used . 20 ml of bupivacaine ( Buvicaine HCl % 0.5 ) and prilocaine ( Priloc HCl % 2 ) 1:1 mixture will be prepared in a way that there will be 5mcg adrenaline per ml . ( 9ml bupivacaine , 9ml prilocaine and 2ml saline with 50 mcg adrenaline per ml ) The ultrasound probe will be placed on the clavicle , the supraclavicular block will be applied in the coronal oblique plane using the in-plane technique . 3 different approaches of supraclavicular block will be compared . Approaches share the same probe position and needle entry point but differ in where the local anesthetic is given . Group 1 : Local anesthetic mixture will be given to the corner pocket - where the artery and the first rib intersect in the sonoanatomical image . Group 2 : 10 ml of the local anesthetic mixture will be given to the described corner pack and the remaining 10 ml into the largest nerve cluster ( Intracluster injection ) . Group 3 : Local anesthetic mixture will be administered by multi injection method between the nerve groups seen in the sonoanatomical image . The diaphragm thickening fraction and evaluations will be made by another experienced anesthesiologist , double-blindness will be achieved by being blind to the patient 's group . Effects of phrenic nerve block on diaphraghma muscle will be evaluated by diaphraghma thickining fraction.All patients will be evaluated with USG in a head-up position facing the side to be operated before and 30 minutes after the block is performed.The probe will be placed perpendicular to the chest wall , in the eighth or ninth intercostal space , between the anterior axillary and midaxillary lines , 0.5 to 2 cm below the costophrenic sinus . The diaphragm will be viewed as a structure with three distinct layers , including two parallel echoic lines ( Diaphragmatic pleura and peritoneum ) and a hypoechoic line between them ( Diaphragm muscle ) . The patient will be instructed to breathe up to total lung capacity ( TLC ) and then exhale to residual volume ( RV ) . Several diaphragm images will be taken , at least three at the point of maximum thickening in TLC and at least three at minimum thickness in RV . On each B-mode image , diaphragm thickness will be measured from the middle of the pleural line to the middle of the peritoneal line . Then DTI will be calculated as a percentage from the following formula : ( Max thickness at the end of inspiration - Max thickness at the end of the expiration ) / Max thickness at the end of the expiration . With this formula , we can determine the involvement of phrenic nerve by looking at the rate of diaphragm thickening before and after supraclavicular block in different groups .

Rift Valley fever is a disease caused by RVFV and it is transmitted to humans through a mosquito bite or contact with virus-contaminated tissues and fluids . Although initially restricted to Africa , the virus can be transmitted by several different mosquito species that are more widely distributed than the virus itself , leading to concerns of disease spread as has occurred in the Arabian Peninsula and Madagascar . In humans , RVFV infection usually presents as a sudden febrile illness , but severe manifestations including bleeding disorders and neurological complications may also occur . RVFV is considered a global health threat with significant potential for international spread and use in bioterrorism . Vaccines against RVFV are available for livestock , however no licensed vaccines or specific treatments are currently available for humans . The study will enable assessment of the safety of the new vaccine called ChAdOx1 RVF and the extent of immune response in healthy volunteers . Healthy adult volunteers will receive a single dose of a new candidate vaccine at different doses . The objective of this first-in-human study is to find the optimal dose of the vaccine , balancing immune responses and profile of adverse events . Healthy volunteers aged 18-50 will be recruited in Oxford and vaccinated at the Centre for Clinical Vaccinology and Tropical Medicine and will be followed for a period of 3 months .

The study will be conducted in 1 clinical site in the New Zealand , consisting of 2 parts : Part A ( single ascending dose [ SAD ] ) and Part B ( multiple ascending dose [ MAD ] ) .","This is a Phase 1 , randomized , 2-part ( Part A and B ) , double-blind , placebo controlled single and multiple ascending doses study designed to assess the safety , tolerability , and PK of INS018_055 when administered as oral doses to healthy subjects . Additionally , this study will investigate the impact of food on the PK of INS018_055 . Part A ( Single Ascending Dose [ SAD ] ) : Eight healthy subjects will be assigned to each of up to 5 sequential dose cohorts and will be randomly assigned within each dose cohort to receive INS018_055 or a matched placebo in a ratio of 3:1 ( 6 active , 2 placebo ) on Day 1 for a total of up to approximately 40 subjects . Subjects in Part A will be admitted to the study site on Day -1 and dosed on Day 1 after fasting ( nothing to eat or drink , except water ) for at least 10 hours . Water is not allowed 1 hour prior to and 1 hour after dosing . Water can be consumed ad libitum at other times . Subjects will remain fasted on Day 1 for 4 hours after dosing . Subjects will be discharged from the study site on Day 4 , after the scheduled procedures and review of the Day 4 safety data by the investigator ( or designee ) . Subjects will come back for an end of study ( EOS ) visit on Day 8 ( ± 1 day ) . A sentinel cohort of 2 subjects will be used to mitigate the risk of unexpected adverse events ( AEs ) not predicted by preclinical pharmacology and toxicology studies for each dosing cohort , starting with Cohort 1 ( the initial dose cohort ) . The sentinel subjects will be dosed in a blinded fashion ( 1 active , 1 placebo ) and monitored for at least 1 day before the remaining 6 subjects in that cohort are dosed . Initiation of dosing of the remaining 6 subjects will depend on an initial safety review by the investigator indicating that administration of the study treatment was safe and well tolerated in the sentinel subjects . Dose escalation will occur only after the real time PK , safety , and tolerability data ( including reported AEs , physical examinations , vital signs , electrocardiograms ( ECGs ) , and clinical laboratory results up to 48 hours after dosing ) of the preceding dose cohort for at least 6 subjects are assessed and the study treatment is deemed safe and well tolerated by the safety review committee ( SRC ) . As new safety and/or PK data become available , the anticipated dose escalation scheme may change following a review of the data by the SRC . Preliminary PK data from subjects in this study will help guide dose escalation to higher doses . Dose escalation in Cohorts 4 and 5 will only occur after the PK data from at least the first 2 cohorts have been assessed and deemed sufficient to model exposures for Cohorts 4 and 5 . Food Effect Assessment ( Cohort 4 in Part A only ) : Subjects in Cohort 4 of Part A will participate in a food effect arm . The actual dose level for food effect cohort is subject to change and will be confirmed by the SRC after review of data from at least the first 2 cohorts of the SAD . Following the standard SAD dosing on Day 1 and at least 3 days of follow up/washout ( or 5 times the estimated half-life of INS018_055 based on the observed data , whichever is longer ) ( Period 1 ) , enrolled subjects will enter Period 2 and be re administered the same dose of INS018_055 or matching placebo ( the same treatment that they received on Day 1 of Period 1 ) after completing a standard high-fat meal . Subjects will fast ( nothing to eat and drink , except water ) for at least 10 hours overnight and receive a standard high-fat breakfast 30 minutes prior to dosing . The high-fat breakfast will be consumed within approximately 30 minutes . Subjects will remain at the study site on Day 4 of Period 2 until the scheduled procedures and review of the Day 4 safety data by the investigator ( or designee ) are completed . The washout period of at least 3 days ( or 5 times the estimated half life of INS018_055 based on the observed data , whichever is longer ) may be extended based on available PK data from previous cohorts . The Day -1 procedures will not be repeated for Period 2 . Physical examinations , vital sign measurements , 12-lead ECGs , and clinical laboratory evaluations will be performed at selected time points throughout the study . Subjects will also be closely monitored for AEs throughout the study . Blood samples for PK will be collected up to 72 hours after study treatment administration on Day 1 for all cohorts . For biomarkers ( CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells ) , blood samples will be collected at check-in ( Day -1 ) , Day 2 , and Day 4 after administration of INS018_055 . Fecal occult blood tests will be done with all stools passed at screening , check-in ( Day -1 ) , and during the 72 hour observation period . Subjects will be discharged on Day 4 . Part B ( Multiple Ascending Dose [ MAD ] ) : Eight healthy subjects will be assigned to each of up to 5 sequential once daily ( QD ) or twice daily ( BID ) dose cohorts and will be randomly assigned within each dose cohort to receive INS018_055 or a matched placebo for 10 days in a ratio of 3:1 ( 6 active , 2 placebo ) , for a total of up to approximately 40 subjects . Subjects in Part B will begin dosing , after safety and tolerability data ( including reported AEs , physical examination , clinical laboratory results , 12-lead ECGs , and vital signs ) from at least the first 3 cohorts ( Cohorts 1 to 3 ) in Part A are assessed and the study treatment is deemed safe and well tolerated by the SRC . Additionally , sufficient PK data from at least the first 3 cohorts of Part A must be obtained to model exposures in Part B . The dosing schedule , either QD or BID , will be decided by the SRC after review of the PK , safety , and tolerability data from the first 3 cohorts of Part A . The initial MAD cohorts will begin dosing with the remaining SAD cohorts . The top dose explored in Part B will not exceed the maximum dose explored in Part A . Subsequent dose escalations in Part B will not occur until the safety ( including AEs , physical examination , clinical laboratory results , vital signs , and 12-lead ECGs ) and tolerability data up to and including Day 14 of the preceding MAD dose cohort for at least 6 subjects are assessed and the study treatment is deemed safe by the SRC . As new safety or PK data become available , the dose escalation scheme may change . Subjects may not receive a subsequent higher dose and may instead be administered a lower dose or may repeat the same daily dose with a different administration schema , eg , BID instead of QD dosing , to achieve lower maximum observed plasma concentration ( Cmax ) values , particularly if the safety findings are believed to be linked to the Cmax values . The highest dose in the MAD ( either QD or BID ) will be dosed in a staggered way if accrued PK data from previous cohorts predict potential exposures above the no observed adverse effect level , with 2 subjects starting dosing at least 7 days before the remaining 6 subjects ; initiation of dosing of the remaining 6 subjects will depend on an initial safety review by the investigator indicating that administration of the study treatment was safe and well tolerated in the sentinel subjects . Each subject in Part B will be admitted to the study site on Day -1 and will begin daily dosing on Day 1 . Study treatment is to be administered daily at approximately the same time in the morning . For BID dosing , the second dose of study treatment will be administered approximately 12 hours after the morning dose of study treatment .

Standardized meals will be provided to the subjects throughout the study . Lunch will be provided approximately 4 hours after the morning dose , dinner will be provided approximately 10 hours after the morning dose , and a snack will be provided approximately 13 hours after the morning dose . Physical examinations , vital sign measurements , 12-lead ECGs , and clinical laboratory evaluations ( including liver function test results ) will be performed at selected time points throughout the dosing interval . Subjects will be closely monitored for AEs throughout the study . Blood samples for PK analyses will be collected up to 72 hours after study treatment administration on Day 10 . Urine samples for PK analysis will be collected before dosing ( Day 1 as a single void collected within 0 to 24 hours ) and over the following intervals after dosing : 0 to 4 , 4 to 8 , 8 to 12 , and 12 to 24 hours on Day 1 and 0 to 4 , 4 to 8 , 8 to 12 , 12 to 24 , and 24 to 48 hours on Day 10 for both QD and BID cohorts .

Ain Shams University,NCT05002101,Daily Zinc Supplement Effect on Prevention of Diarrhea and Acute Respiratory Infections in Children Less Than Five Years,Ain Shams University,4,1,Zinc Deficiency,Dietary Supplement,zinc,Prevention,Single,Zinc deficiency in children is a major problem which leads to compromised immunity and accordingly repeated infections . This study aims to investigate the effect of supplementing zinc to decrease the incidence of diarrhea and respiratory illness in children between 6 months and 5 years in Paediatric Outpatient Clinic in Ain Shams University Hospital .,"Zinc is a trace element that plays essential roles in protein and lipid metabolism , cell growth and differentiation , and the immune system ; either cellular or humoral immunity . There is no specialized zinc storage system in the body , accordingly , a daily intake of zinc is required to maintain a steady state . Zinc deficiency can cause compromised immune function , accordingly this can lead to infections and growth defects among young children According to literature review search , there is lack of studies on the preventive effect of zinc supplementation on Egyptian children less than five years old ; the age group which is known by the suboptimal nutritional status and the high prevalence of infection . Accordingly , the present study is aiming to evaluate the impact of 4 months of daily zinc supplementation on the incidence of diarrhea and respiratory illness and to detect the frequency of daily dietary intake of zinc-rich food children between 6 months and 5 years in Paediatric Outpatient Clinic in Ain Shams University Hospital . Objectives : To evaluate the impact of 4 months of daily zinc supplementation on : - the incidence and the severity of diarrheal morbidity . - the incidence of acute respiratory infection . To measure the level of serum zinc in children between 6 months and 5 years attending Paediatric Outpatient Clinic in Ain Shams University Hospital . To compare between children who had initially low serum zinc level with those with normal level as regard the reduction in the incidence of diarrhea and respiratory illness . To measure the frequency of daily dietary intake of zinc-rich food in children between 6 months and 5 years attending Paediatric Outpatient Clinic in Ain Shams University Hospital . Methodology : • Study type : a single blinded , randomized controlled trial . • Study setting : Paediatric Outpatient Clinic in Ain Shams University Hospital . Sampling method : A convenience sample of children between 6 months and 5 years was recruited from the Paediatric Outpatient Clinic in Ain Shams University Hospital . • Study population : Eligible children aged between 6 months and 5 years attending Paediatric Outpatient Clinic in Ain Shams University Hospital was included . Randomization and allocation : Random assignment of the sampled children to either the study group receiving zinc or the control group receiving placebo was done . The study was single-blinded , where the children 's mothers wo n't know either their children are enrolled in the study group or the control group . • Study tool : - Baseline questionnaire : Structured interview questionnaire was used at the first meeting with the mother to collect baseline data . The questionnaire includes baseline characteristics , such as child age , child sex , family size , child rank , child feeding practices ( breastfeeding ) , maternal literacy , vaccination history and birth weight . Also , the baseline questionnaire assessed the occurrence and duration of diarrhea and respiratory illness in the past month before the start of zinc supplementation . Questions are adopted from the Demographic and Health Survey ( DHS ) questionnaire ( Ministry of Health and Population/Egypt , 2015 ) . - Questionnaire for Zinc-Rich Food Intake Pattern : The questionnaire , a dietary history recall instrument , was used to elicit and capture information on frequency of daily dietary intake over previous 1 month of two categories of zinc-rich foods namely : Foods of animal origin devoid of zinc antinutritional factor ( liver , fish , milk , eggs ) Food of vegetable origin including those known to contain a zinc antinutritional factor ( cereals , beans ) - Serum zinc : A blood sample was collected from all included children at the beginning of the study to estimate the baseline serum zinc level . Venous blood samples ( about 4 milliliters ) were collected in heparinised tubes and transported to the laboratory for centrifugation and serum zinc estimation using atomic absorption spectrophotometer graphites . - Intervention : The children were randomized to receive daily zinc sulphate or placebo . The elemental zinc dose was 3 mg/ day to children whose weight is less than 10 kg and 7 mg/ day to children whose weight is 10 kg or more . This dose is more than the recommended dietary allowance for supplementation so as to allow for possible impairment in absorption of ingested zinc among children as a result of consumption of a predominantly phytate-rich cereal-based diet , bacterial overgrowth , and protozoal or parasitic infestations .

Combination treatment with JNJ-73763989 and NA has the potential to specifically decrease HBV viral antigen levels and inhibit viral replication . Since HBsAg is immune suppressive , the direct reduction of HBsAg levels by JNJ-73763989 is anticipated to contribute to the restoration of the immune response that is impaired in chronic HBV infection .

"University of California, Berkeley",NCT05003063,Effects of Acetylcholine and Attention on Visual Spatial Representations in the Brain,"University of California, Berkeley",0,1,Visual Perception,Drug,Donepzil,Basic Science,Triple,"This study in , healthy human subjects using fMRI and MRS ( magnetic resonance spectroscopy ) characterizes , how attention and acetylcholine affect visual perception and the brain 's representation of the visual environment . Levels of acetylcholine in the cerebral cortex will be enhanced by administration of donepezil , an inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase . Half the subjects will receive donepezil and other half will receive placebo .","The long-term objective of this project is to characterize how attention and acetylcholine affect visual perception and the brain 's representation of the visual environment . Acetylcholine is a naturally occurring neurotransmitter , and acetylcholine release is elevated during periods of sustained attention . Both acetylcholine and attention enhance aspects of visual perception , but the underlying brain mechanisms are poorly understood . The proposed work will address these questions in healthy human subjects by using functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) and MRS ( magnetic resonance spectroscopy ) to measure the brain 's responses to visual stimuli . Our previous studies have shown that increasing levels of acetylcholine in the brain enhances the spatial resolution of the brain 's representation of the visual environment . The proposed research will document exactly which brain areas mediate this effect of acetylcholine and will also characterize the effects of attention on these measures of spatial resolution in the brain . The technique of fMRI ( functional magnetic resonance imaging ) and MRS ( magnetic resonance spectroscopy ) , both subtypes of MRI , will be employed to measure brain activity in different brain areas while subjects are performing a visual attention task . Levels of acetylcholine in the cerebral cortex will be enhanced by administration of donepezil , an inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase , the enzyme that metabolizes acetylcholine . Moreover , the technique of MRS will be employed to locally quantify the levels of acetylcholine in different brain areas . In addition to providing information about how attention is represented in the brain and how it affects processing of visual stimuli , the present experiments should also shed light on the function of the cholinergic projection from the basal forebrain to the cerebral cortex . As this projection is thought to be selectively impaired in Alzheimer 's disease , knowledge concerning its function in the healthy brain may be useful for understanding the etiology of this disease and for development of appropriate therapies . BEHAVIORAL PHARMACOLOGY : Sessions : Subjects will perform 6 behavioral sessions over several days outside the scanner , split into two experimental parts . There will be 2 baseline sessions without donepezil/placebo and 4 testing sessions with donepezil/placebo . Each behavioral ( outside the scanner ) session will last 1-2 hours . During the testing session , subjects will be given one pill of ( 2.5 or 5 or 10mg ) donepezil or placebo per session . The choice of the pill will be determined by the flip of a coin . The drug dosage ( 2.5 or 5 or 10mg ) will be determined so as to ensure that there are equal number of participants per drug dosage . The pill ( drug or placebo ) not selected for the first experimental session in a pair will be administered during the second experimental session . Task : A typical cognitive task will involve presentation of images or words on a computer monitor or sounds through headphones . The subjects are asked to respond to certain stimuli by pressing a button . All stimuli are presented at a comfortable level . The cognitive task performed during the behavioral is an object-tracking/target detection paradigm in which subjects indicate whether a target is presented or not on each experimental trial . The target , when it is presented , is a visual stimulus at the threshold of detectability . On some trials , subjects will receive cues indicating target location and/or features that will facilitate target detection . Subjects will be asked to report by pressing a button on a response box . Subjects will receive breaks every 5-10 minutes or more frequently if they desire . MRI AND PHARMACOLOGY : Sessions : For experiments involving MRI , there will be a total of 6 sessions across several days , split into two experimental parts . There will be two baseline MRI session without donepezil/placebo and 4 testing sessions ( two donepezil , two placebo ) . Subjects will be given one pill of ( 2.5 or 5 or 10mg ) donepezil or placebo per session . The choice of the pill will be determined by the flip of a coin . The pill not selected for the first experimental part will be administered during the second experimental part . For MRI experiments , the experimenter will escort the subject to the Brain Imaging Center in Li Ka Shing about 2.5 hours after pill administration , and fMRI measurements will begin approximately 3 hours after pill administration . The MRI sessions typically take 1-2.5 hours , and the subject is given frequent breaks . The subject may stop the experiment at any time . Subjects undergoing MRI scanning will be asked to lie on their back in the MRI scanner . Before being scanned , a MRI imaging coil made of plastic will be placed around the subject 's head . The subject will not come into contact with the coil during the experiment . Foam pads will be placed around the subject 's head to limit head movement during the study .

Methods : This mixed methods study evaluates the effectiveness of a combined vaccination-screening strategy to reduce HPV prevalence/incidence and occurrence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasms grade 2+ and/or anal intraepithelial neoplasms grade 2+ , using Kaplan-Meier . The time-to-event method will evaluate time from positive results for specific anogenital HPV to incidence of anogenital lesions containing that HPV type . Conclusions : This study will generate scientific evidence on effectiveness of a combined vaccination-screening strategy to reduce the burden of HPV-associated neoplasms within vulnerable populations in Mexico .","Men who have sex with men ( MSM ) , people with HIV , homeless people ( many of whom participate in survival sex ) , female sex workers , transgender women and rape victims are at high risk for human papillomavirus ( HPV ) infection and consequently developing cancers associated with chronic HPV infection including cervical , vaginal , vulvar , and anal cancers in women , cancer of the penis , anal cancer , in men , and cancer of the oropharynx , tongue , and tonsils in both men and women , In part , this is related to increased life expectancy among people with HIV ( given greater anti-retroviral treatment coverage ) . Some countries have implemented HPV vaccination policies that include men . This is based on promotion of protection against an increased risk of HPV infection , universal increase in coverage and a gender equity perspective . Since population-level introduction of HPV vaccines , there has been a dramatic impact in areas with over 60 % vaccination coverage . Decreases of approximately 90 % have been reported for HPV-6/11/16/18 infections , over 90 % for new cases of genital warts , 45 % for low-grade cytological abnormalities , and 85 % for anogenital high-grade histological lesions . The HPV FASTER concept combines HPV vaccination with HPV screening . It is based on the HPV vaccine 's high efficacy and the high sensitivity of high-risk HPV testing for primary detection of anogenital cancer precursor lesions ( as documented by our research group in more than 200,000 Mexican women ) . This strategy is effective because HPV vaccination among women and men over a wide age range offers protection to those not currently infected and protects against subsequent re-infections16 . Thus , a combined HPV vaccination and screening strategy will potentially : 1 ) mitigate the demand for timely screening tests by expanding screening intervals ; 2 ) improve the cost-benefit balance of secondary prevention programs ; and 3 ) provide greater protection and quality of life to more people by reducing the burden of diseases attributable to HPV . This intervention can save many lives over the next 30 years and be more cost-effective than traditional approaches . Recently , the US vaccination advisory group recommended HPV vaccination among sexually abused children , recognizing their increased risk of HPV infection , . The US Centers for Disease Control recommends administering the HPV vaccine to subjects with immunosuppressive conditions , HIV infection , and men who have sex with men . HPV vaccination in HIV-positive people is safe and reduces the incidence of HPV-associated cancers , including anal cancer , which is increasing in these populations , . Moreover , some research has shown that vaccination against HPV in populations with HIV is cost-effective . HPV serotypes 16 and 18 , found in the HPV bivalent and tetravalent vaccines , have an estimated relative contribution to invasive cervical cancer of at least 70 % in Latin America . These vaccines are highly effective , provide high levels of immunogenicity , have acceptable security profiles and have been incorporated into public vaccination policies with 3-dose schedules over a 6-month period based on pharmaceutical industry recommendations . Alternative schedules of population vaccinations have been implemented in spite of the conflict of interest with the pharmaceutical industry . The first of these schedules was conducted in Quebec , Canada where the extended 0-6-60 month schedule was promoted for girls under 16 years . Later , in Mexico , a similar vaccination program recommended by a group of experts coordinated by the National Institute of Public Health was initiated . Mexico was a pioneer in adopting a 2-dose alternative vaccination schedule in April 2014 . Currently , there is evidence that alternative schedules are not inferior to the traditional schedule in terms of immunogenicity . In 2012 , Switzerland adopted a 2-dose vaccination schedule against HPV in girls under 15 years old under assuming age was the main mediator of the protection induced by the vaccine and not the number of doses . This assumption would explain why the vaccine was the main inducer of IgG responses , plasma cells , and memory B cell formation and why 2 doses administered with a 6-month interval provided similar protection during the initial years of vaccination . In April 2014 , the Council officially pronounced the adoption of a vaccination schedule against HPV with only 2 doses with a periodicity of 0 and 6 months . The justification for this resolution , in which Mexico was a pioneer and was subsequently officially recommended by the WHO as a vaccination policy at a global level , was that the immunological responses of girls aged 9 to 11 years after two doses of HPV vaccine were similar to or greater than those obtained after three doses in women aged 16 to 26 years . The benefits of this decision are logistical and economic ; increasing coverage and providing greater flexibility in the application of the second dose . Moreover , the savings generated from not administering a third dose are considerable . Alternative schedules with two doses and schedules with a third dose at 60 months in girls 9-11 years of age can offer a ) improvements in the immune response in the medium- and long-term , because there is evidence that a new exposure to HPV increases the expression of antibodies logarithmically , and b ) advantages in its administration , since it is easier to organize these schedules within the framework of schools and consequently provides a better opportunity for equity in obtaining greater coverage and adherence to complete schedules in the captive population before leaving compulsory schooling . However , although the recommendation is plausible from an immunological perspective , there is no evidence from clinical trials of efficacy to support this determination for ethical reasons . Currently , a paradigm shift is perceived toward the application of a single dose of vaccine against HPV . Research groups at a global level are evaluating the hypothesis that men and women who receive one versus two doses do not have a higher prevalence of HPV and that consequently the effect of the intervention is equivalent . In this regard , demonstration studies are being conducted in population universes to evaluate the effect of a single dose of HPV vaccine . The strategy is to evaluate the effect of administering 1 versus 2 doses in a specific community using a randomized intervention allocation strategy . In the 2-dose intervention group , the most biologically and logistically efficient approach is to administer the second intervention between 6 and 12 months after the first intervention . The outcome to be evaluated in men who have sex with men is the presence of HPV DNA in the anal canal , which is obtained and determined in the basal measurement during the administration of the first dose . This type of intervention is feasible in Mexico due to its invaluable tradition of innovation in public policies for the prevention and control of anogenital cancer and its implementation of large demonstration studies . Currently , it can be affirmed that with the current evidence , vaccination of all groups at risk of anogenital cancer with a single dose will be the preamble to the attenuation of the impact of persistent HPV infections and their consequent lesions . Methods Hypotheses The application of a combined HPV vaccination scheme and screening through the identification of high-risk HPV subtypes will reduce the prevalence of HPV infection in the oral and anogenital cavities in the different study groups , at 12 months post-vaccination . Consequently , the occurrence of grade 2 or higher anal intraepithelial neoplasia ( AIN 2+ ) lesions in men and high-grade or higher cervical intraepithelial neoplasia ( CIN 2+ ) lesions in women will decrease . Alternative vaccination schedules of one versus two doses of prophylactic vaccines against HPV are equivalent in terms of effectiveness . Urine and self-collected vaginal , anal canal , and oral cavity samples constitute an alternative epidemiological surveillance approach for monitoring the impact of a combined strategy HPV vaccination and screening for high-risk HPV subtypes in vulnerable populations . Objectives Primary objective • To evaluate the effectiveness of a combined strategy of HPV vaccination and screening for high-risk HPV subtypes to reduce the occurrence of HPV in the anogenital region and oral cavity in five highly vulnerable groups in Mexico City , Mexico : men who have sex with men , female sex workers , transgender women , subjects living in street situations , and people who have suffered rape . Secondary objectives To evaluate the effectiveness of alternative HPV vaccination schedules . To evaluate the usefulness of the collection of self-collected vaginal , anal , and urine samples as alternatives for monitoring the impact of a combined strategy of HPV vaccination and screening based on the detection of high-risk HPV subtypes . To assess the barriers to and facilitators of the introduction of a combined HPV vaccination and primary screening strategy with tests for high-risk HPV subtypes in the study groups . Study population and procedures The sample sizes for the five cohorts are : 6,000 MSM , 500 transgender women , 400 homeless men and women , 400 sexual assault victims , 2500 female sex workers . This study is a mixed methods study combining public health interventions offering primary and secondary prevention of HPV to populations highly vulnerable to these health problems with evaluation of the interventions in a 12-month follow-up . In addition the study includes qualitative interviews that will undergo systematic analysis on the perceptions , meanings , and individual experiences of the intervention , within the study groups . A central element of the present project is a parallel study of five sentinel cohorts of the adult population ≥ 14 years and ≤ 45 years of age that is operationally coordinated by the Condesa and Iztapalapa Specialized Clinics , which belong to the health services of Mexico City and the Program of Care for rape victims . This program is coordinated by the Specialized Clinics in collaboration with the Mexico City Attorney General of Justice.especially the Victims Care Center , which is a program of the Center for Therapy in Support of Victims of Sex Crimes . The investigators attempt to include at least 80 % of the population of each interest group in the epidemiological component of the project . Study subjects will be recruited ( 2018-2019 ) during their routine care within any program or service the participant attend within the Condesa and Iztapalapa Specialized Clinics ; in addition , posters will be placed within the clinics inviting potential study subjects to participate and civil society organizations which collaborate with the clinics will be visited regularly to invite persons involved in their activities to participate in the study . For the qualitative intervention component , individuals from the five vulnerable groups will be selected for voluntary participation in qualitative semi-structured interviews . This sub-sample will be purposely selected to include the maximum variation of characteristics , and 12 to 16 semi-structured individual interviews will be conducted for each study group . These interviews will explore perceptions of HPV , experiences as users of preventive care for HPV and related cancers , acceptability of and meanings related to HPV vaccination and barriers to and facilitators of primary prevention ( vaccination ) and secondary prevention ( screening and treatment ) of HPV . The study protocol and instruments were approved by the Research , Ethics and Biosecurity Committees of the National Institute of Public Health . All study participants will provide signed informed consent before participating in any study procedure or completing any study instruments ( and consent forms will be signed by two witnesses ) . Sample collection and vaccination At the beginning of the study , all MSM who agree to participate in the study will receive the HPV vaccination in an alternative schedule for MSM of 1 versus 2 doses over a 6-month period . In addition , a control group will be screened for high-risk HPV and vaccinated at 12 months . For transgender women , women and men living on the street , and women and men who have suffered rape , a 2-dose regimen of the tetravalent HPV vaccine will be administered over a 6-month period . The additional combined strategy corresponds to screening for high-risk HPV subtypes to identify intraepithelial lesions in the transformation zone of the anal and/or cervical canals . Additionally , samples will be self-collected from the anal canal , oral cavity , and vaginal canal . These samples will be collected both at the baseline measurement and at 12 months after vaccination to assess changes in the prevalence and incidence of new HPV infections in the different study groups . All HPV-positive anal and cervical samples will be evaluated using liquid-based cytology ; analysis will be done at the National Institute of Public Health . On a single occasion , additional samples will be collected from a proportional sample of the different study groups ( 70 % of MSM and 90 % of women , not including transgender women ) for the identification of other STIs , including Neisseria gonorrhea , syphilis , HIV , herpes simplex virus type 2 , hepatitis B virus , and hepatitis C virus . Positive cases will be referred to the corresponding medical care within their respective affiliated clinics . The HPV detection test has been installed at the National Institute of Public Health with the Cobas 4800 HPV platform . This test is a qualitative test that detects 14 high-risk genotypes using specific probes . It detects genotypes 16 and 18 individually and a pool of other types ( 31 , 33 , 35 , 39 , 45 , 51 , 52 , 56 , 58 , 59 , 66 , and 68 ) cataloged as high risk . Cytological evaluation will be conducted for all HPV-positive samples from both the anal canal and cervix . A urine sample will be obtained , centrifuged , and prepared for DNA extraction . The sample will be stored at -20°C prior to processing for HPV detection . The techniques for these purposes are under evaluation . Blood samples ( 10-ml ) will be collected from the study participants by vacuum venipuncture . The collected samples will be centrifuged to separate the sera into 2-ml aliquots , which will be stored in cryo-vials at -20°C prior to processing . Antibody responses to viral and bacterial etiological agents will be conducted as follows : Hepatitis B and hepatitis C. Automated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay . The analytical procedure will be conducted according to the corresponding manufacturer 's laboratory instructions , . Syphilis . The Venereal Disease Research Laboratory ( VDRL ) screening test and the Serodia Treponema pallidum ( TP ) confirmatory test by particle agglutination . The analytical procedures will be performed in accordance with the laboratory instructions of the corresponding manufacturers . Herpes simplex virus type 2 . Microplate immuno-enzymatic assay for the detection of type-specific viral antibodies . Confirmation of positive samples by Western blotting assay . The analytical procedures will be performed in accordance with the laboratory instructions of the corresponding manufacturers In cervical samples , an automated chemo-luminescent assay for bacterial DNA detection will be performed using polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) . The analytical procedure will be conducted according to the corresponding manufacturer 's laboratory instructions . Data analysis To estimate the effectiveness of the strategy of combining HPV vaccination with HPV screening , the differences in the prevalence of HPV and the cumulative incidence of HPV infection and/or development of CIN 2+ and/or AIN 2+ will be estimated during the first 12 months of follow-up using the Kaplan-Meier method . The time-to-event method will be applied to evaluate the time from the specific type of HPV genital positivity to the incidence of anogenital lesions harboring the same HPV subtype within the lesion . The analytical unit for this study is HPV 16/18 type-specific infection and generic high-risk strain infection . The transcripts of individual interviews will be analyzed with through coding transcribed material , which implies the classification of pieces of the interviews into a priori and emerging categories to systematize the information and search for patterns , similarities , and differences .",2021-09-18,"November 24, 2021","Inclusion Criteria : Between 14 and 45 years of age Men who identify themselves as having sex with other men Transgender women Women or men living on the street/homeless Women or men who have suffered rape People with or without HIV infection Exclusion Criteria : Under 14 years or over 45 years of age History of any serious adverse reaction prior to any component of the influenza vaccine , such as life-threating , hospitalization , partial or total disability , or incurable damage Chronic HIV infection in stages A3 , B3 and C3 , and/or CD4 cell count less than 200 cells per cubic millimeter Presence in the HIV-positive participant of an active opportunistic infection such as : Toxoplasma Gondii encephalitis , Cryptococcosis , Tuberculous meningitis , Pulmonary tuberculosis , Community acquired pneumonia , Pneumocystis jiroveci , Isosporidiasis , Cryptosporidiasis , Salmonellosis , Candida esophagitis and esophagitis , Esophagitis Vascular neoplasia Pregnancy confirmed by laboratory test Previous vaccination against HPV Previous treatment of intraanal lesions",6000,0,14 Years,45 Years

Blood samples will be collected , and participants will need to keep a daily symptom diary and answer some other questionnaires .","TNP are a considerable burden and affects significantly the quality of life of the sufferer . There are medications for their management but while they may work for some patients , may not work for the others ; in addition , side effects may be present for some patients with the need to decrease dosage to not optimal levels . Furthermore , the indications of these drugs are for other neuropathic pain disorders and currently there is no medication specifically indicated for the management of TNP based on its molecular pathophysiology . The calcitonin gene-related peptide ( CGRP ) is a key neuropeptide involved in migraine pathophysiology . There is evidence showing that CGRP has a role in other disorders mediated by the trigeminal system in addition to migraine ; CGRP has shown to have a role in orofacial pain such as in TMD and in trigeminal neuropathic pain . Erenumab-aooe is the first antibody therapeutic targeting the CGRP receptor with FDA approval for migraine prevention that is well tolerated and with a good safety profile . Therefore , the scientific premise for this study is that inhibiting the CGRP pathway in trigeminal neuropathic pain will decrease pain and pain related outcomes in a safe and well tolerated manner for this patient population .

Participants will attend 6 clinic visits ( Visit 0-Visit 5 ) over a period of 21 weeks ( 20 +/- 1 weeks ) . Changes in pain intensity and other pain outcomes related to TMD will be assessed . Blood samples will be collected , and participants will need to keep a daily symptom diary and answer some other questionnaires .","Chronic TMD is a considerable burden and affects significantly the quality of life of the sufferer . For some patients , TMD has a tendency to remit or improve pain symptomatology over time but for others , TMD have the potential to become chronic and to lead to persistent dysfunction . Different classes of medications from anti-inflammatories , muscle relaxants , anxiolytics , antidepressants , anticonvulsants and a β-blocker have indicated to be beneficial for some patients as well as in clinical studies , but tolerability and side effects may be present for some patients . Furthermore , the indications of these drugs are for other disorders , so it is unclear their mechanism of action in TMD pathophysiology . Currently there is no medication specifically indicated for the management of TMD based on its molecular pathophysiology . However , there is evidence showing that CGRP has a role in TMD pathophysiology . CGRP is a key molecule in migraine pathophysiology . Erenumab-aooe is the first antibody therapeutic targeting the CGRP and has shown efficacy , to be well tolerated and with a safety profile similar to placebo for the prevention of migraine . The scientific premise for this study is that inhibiting CGRP in chronic TMD will decrease pain , pain related outcomes and improve TMJ biomechanics ( function ) in a safe and well tolerated manner for this patient population . Potential participants will be pre-screened at the Brotman Facial Pain clinic and the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinic both at the University of Maryland , School of Dentistry or by telephone ; those willing to participate will be scheduled for a screening and baseline visit ( Visit 0 ) . During this visit potential participants will be evaluated for eligibility ( meeting the Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders ( DC/TMD ) for Clinical and Research Applications ) of chronic TMD ( myalgia +/- arthralgia ) and written informed consent will be obtained .

VA Loma Linda Health Care System,NCT05037032,Effects of Naltrexone on Nocturnal Breathing Patterns at Altitude,VA Loma Linda Health Care System,4,1,Altitude,Drug,Naltrexone Pill,Supportive Care,Triple,"Sleep at altitude is often poor . The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of a single dose of the opioid antagonist , naltrexone , on sleep quality and periodic breathing after rapid ascent to ~3800m altitude .","Sleep at high altitude is notoriously poor due to a combination of the unusual sleep environment and hypoxia during sleep . Many people develop what is called periodic breathing ( PB ) during sleep . PB may improve overall mean nocturnal oxygen saturation ( SpO2 ) although this is not entirely clear . Simultaneously , PB may further disturb sleep at altitude and has been associated with nighttime arousals from sleep . Medications that may decrease the amount of PB might improve sleep quality . The FDA approved drug , naltrexone , is a specific antagonist to the brain opioid receptors . It is a non-addicting drug which has never been studied at altitude . Clinical Relationships : Sleep disordered breathing is a very common disorder throughout the population , but it worsens with increasing age and BMI . At the same time , many in our Veteran population live in the local mountains and undoubtedly develop PB during sleep in addition to having obstructive sleep apnea . Objectives : The purpose to this study is to evaluate the effects of a single dose of naltrexone on PB and oxygen saturation during sleep at altitude in healthy young participants . The additional purpose will be to assess the subject-perceived sleep quality after the use of naltrexone vs. placebo . Research Design : A prospective , randomized , double-blind , crossover study . Methodology : We plan recruit up to 30 healthy study subjects with no history of sleep disordered breathing . Potential participants will be screened to ensure inclusion and exclusion criteria are met . A baseline low altitude sleep study will be preformed at home . No medication will be given before this baseline sleep study . The sleep study will be similar to the home sleep studies routinely used by the VA Loma Linda Healthcare System 's Sleep Center . Participants will be transported for High Altitude Trip 1 to the Barcroft Laboratory at the White Mountain Research Center ( WMRC ) at 3810 m altitude . At WMRC they will have a sleep study performed , similar to the baseline sleep study , after taking either a single dose of naltrexone or matching placebo . After an appropriate washout period ( at least 5 half-lives ) subjects will again be studied ( High Altitude Trip 2 ) taking the alternate medication ( naltrexone/placebo ) to the one used in the first study . Order of placebo vs. naltrexone will be randomized . Prior to sleep the subject will fill out questionnaires detailing how sleepy they are . On the morning following each sleep study , subjects will fill out a short questionnaire assessing the quality of their sleep . Impact/Significance : Improved knowledge of the mechanisms of PB in hypoxic environments will provide important insights into diagnostic and therapeutic decisions for Veterans who suffer from sleep disordered breathing .",2021-08-20,"April 24, 2023","Inclusion Criteria : Healthy males or females Age 18 to 35 years of age Body-mass index ( BMI ) ≤ 27 At least two weeks after full vaccination for Sars-CoV-2 .

Approximately 400 patients are expected to be enrolled in this study . Patients will be randomized 3:1 to receive FlecIH-103 at a total dose of up to 120 mg estimated total lung dose ( eTLD ) ( n=300 ) or placebo inhalation solution ( n=100 ) . Randomization will be stratified by geographic region ( US and ex-US ) and duration of symptoms of the current AF episode ( ≥1 hour to ≤24 hours and > 24 hours to ≤48 hours ) .","This is a Phase 3 , multicenter , randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled clinical study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of FlecIH-103 ( flecainide acetate inhalation solution ) compared with placebo in patients with recent-onset , symptomatic newly diagnosed or paroxysmal AF . Approximately 400 patients are expected to be enrolled in this study . The study will consist of the following periods : Screening , Observation , and Follow-up . The Screening Period comprises the time from the patient signing informed consent to the time of randomization . Screening begins at least 45 minutes prior to dosing and may be extended as needed due to site logistics . During screening , the patient will be evaluated for study eligibility , have a standard triplicate 12-lead ECG to confirm the diagnosis of AF , have a single-lead patch electrode applied for continuous ECG ( cECG ) recording , undergo a targeted physical examination ( including cardiovascular and respiratory systems ) , have blood drawn for laboratory assessments and a predose pharmacokinetic ( PK ) sample , have their AF-related symptoms assessed , have vital signs assessed periodically , and be monitored via telemetry to ensure they remain predominantly in AF prior to dosing ( ie , no period of SR ≥1 minute in duration or any abnormal rhythm other than AF ) . After confirmation that the patient meets all applicable eligibility criteria , randomization will take place using a central randomization system . The patient is considered enrolled at the time of randomization . The Observation Period comprises the time from randomization through 90 minutes after initiation of dosing . After randomization and just prior to the start of dosing ( T0 ) , the patient 's AF will again be confirmed by a standard triplicate 12-lead ECG ; patients who are not in AF at this time must be withdrawn . The patient will inhale the study drug until conversion of AF to SR occurs for ≥1 minute or the complete dose is administered , whichever occurs first . The complete dose of study drug comprises 2 separate 3.5-minute inhalations separated by a 1-minute break . Telemetric recording of ECG and cECG monitoring will continue and vital signs will be monitored periodically . A PK sample will be collected 2 minutes after completion of dosing followed by another standard triplicate ECG collected 5 minutes after completion of dosing . Finally , AF-related symptoms will be checked and a final PK sample will be collected at 90 minutes after initiation of dosing . Wherever a time point requires collection of ECG and/or vital signs in addition to a PK sample , the PK sample is collected last . If the patient 's AF converts to SR ( sustained for ≥1 minute ) as observed on telemetry during the Observation Period , vital signs and a standard triplicate 12-lead ECG will be recorded immediately following the time of conversion . The Investigator may not offer the patient another rhythm control therapy to cardiovert their AF to SR until after 90 minutes after initiation of dosing . At the end of the Observation Period ( ie , 90 minutes after initiation of dosing ) , the cECG patch will be removed and a standard triplicate 12 lead ECG will be recorded . If the patient 's AF converts to SR ( sustained for ≥1 minute ) after the Observation Period but prior to discharge ( eg , due to ECV or other PCV ) , a standard triplicate 12-lead ECG will be recorded at the time of conversion . The patient may be discharged per the Investigator 's discretion any time after completion of the 90-minute time point assessments . If patient discharge occurs > 1 hour after completion of the last 90-minute time point assessment , all 90-minute time point assessments must be repeated just prior to discharge , excluding the PK sample . The Follow-Up Period consists of 2 follow-up telephone contacts : one at 24 ( +12 ) hours after initiation of dosing , and one at 96 ( ±24 ) hours after initiation of dosing . The patient will also be given contact information and be instructed to contact the clinic in the event that any AF-related symptoms occur before these scheduled contact times . Follow-up contacts may also be performed by video call or in-person if the patient is at the clinic . During each follow-up contact , the patient will be queried for concomitant medications and procedures , AEs , AF-related symptoms , and AF-related interventions . End of study coincides with the 96-hour follow-up contact . An independent Data Monitoring Committee ( DMC ) will monitor safety throughout the study . An independent Clinical Events Committee ( CEC ) will review blinded data to adjudicate the primary and several secondary efficacy endpoints and to adjudicate CV events of special interest ( ie , hypotension , ventricular tachycardia , bradycardia , sinus pause , atrial flutter with 1:1 conduction , and other arrhythmias ) .",2021-08-09,"June 7, 2023","Inclusion Criteria : ≥18 and ≤85 years of age Recent onset of symptomatic newly diagnosed or paroxysmal AF Recent onset is defined as a symptom duration ≥1 and ≤48 hours at time of dosing Newly diagnosed AF is AF that has not been diagnosed previously , independent of its duration Paroxysmal AF is defined as recurrent AF in a patient whose previous AF episode ( s ) self-terminated ( ie , without treatment ) or terminated with intervention ≤7 days of onset .

Difficulty breathing and a low concentration of oxygen in the blood are of concern in patients with COVID-19 , as they indicate that the lungs may be significantly affected . In some patients , respiratory symptoms may progress to the point where oxygen support is needed ( i.e . use of an oxygen prongs , mask or ventilator ) . The exact mechanism of why patients with COVID-19 develop low concentrations of oxygen in blood is not fully understood . Some data suggest that the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 ( SARS-CoV-2 ) , the virus causing Coronavirus Disease 2019 ( COVID-19 ) , can affect the body 's blood vessels directly and extensively . In the lung , blood vessels participate in the absorption of oxygen . Endothelin is a potent hormone produced by human blood vessels . When increased , endothelin can result in the narrowing of blood vessels in the lung and decrease the volume of blood flowing through the lungs . This decrease in in blood flow through the lungs may be one of many factors affecting normal lung function . Ambrisentan can block the effects of endothelin in the body , and this could theoretically improve blood flow through the lungs . This study will evaluate whether ambrisentan , by blocking the effects of the hormone endothelin in the lungs , improves the breathing capacity of patients with COVID-19 , increases the concentration of oxygen in the blood and prevents the progression to respiratory failure and death . Ambrisentan is a drug that is currently used to treat patients with pulmonary hypertension , a disease where blood flow through the lungs is decreased . Subjects participating in this study are those patients hospitalised with severe respiratory symptoms related to COVID-19 , and are considered to be at high-risk of developing respiratory complications . Ambrisentan will be administered in the hospital , and will be continued at home for up to 28 days . In this study , ambrisentan will be administered at much lower doses that those used in patients with pulmonary hypertension .","This is a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , multi-centre trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ambrisentan for the treatment of severe COVID-19 .

Control group will have a placebo treatment ( physiological saline ) . the negative RT-PCR date will be compared in the two groups","Introduction In 2020 The world is incurring coronavirus pandemic . The epidemic of the new coronavirus started in Wuhan , China , in late 2019 , originally called 2019-nCoV and then COVID-19 by the World Health Organization in February 2020 . COVID-19 presented a heavy health systems burden having caused more than 170,000 deaths worldwide as of April 20 , 2020 . However , the treatment protocols for this infection remain controversial . It is the subject of several ongoing studies . The use of vitamin D as a strategy to reduce the frequency and severity of respiratory infections and in particular COVID-19 must be seriously considered . Several studies have studied the role of vitamin D in reducing the risk of viral infections . Indeed , vitamin D supplementation could be a useful measure in improving the immune response of subjects affected by the new coronavirus . This , taking into account the high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in our country . The beneficial effects of vitamin D on protective immunity is partly due to innate immune system action . It reduces the cytokine storm induced by the innate immune system , by decreasing the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and increasing that of anti-inflammatory cytokines . Vitamin D played a major role in the modulation of adaptive immunity . However , evidence on the effectiveness of vitamin D in improving the immune response of confirmed COVID-19 remains lacking . The prolonged duration of the disease may increase the likelihood of transmission . Indeed , the R0 depends on three factors including the contact rate between individuals in the population , the probability of transmission of the infection during contact and the duration of infectiousness . The COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 has transmitted quickly as a global public health emergency . The median duration for Sars-CoV-2 carrying in COVID-19 patients was 20 days ( IQR 16-28 ) ( 9 ) . Research question : What is the role of vitamin D supplementation on the recovery time of asymptomatic and pauci-symptomatic COVID-19 subjects ? Objectives of the study : To assess the effect of vitamin D supplementation on the duration of carriage of the COVID-19 virus in patients with SARS Cov2 with a positive control RT-PCR on day 14 of the date of confirmation of the disease . Type of study : This is a randomized clinical trial without the patient 's knowledge in subjects diagnosed with COVID-19 . B . Method : Study setting : this study will be carried out in the governorate of Monastir in the collective isolation center Eligibility criteria : patients with SARS Cov2 and having a positive RT-PCR at control in 14 days from confirmation of infection for asymptomatic subjects and 7 days after the disappearance of symptoms for pauci-symptomatic subjects . Non-inclusion criteria : Pregnant women and children under the age of 18 will not be included . Intervention : the intervention group will have vitamin D supplementation ( 200,000 IU / 1 mL of Cholecalciferol ( 1 ml ) Oral form ) . Control group will have a placebo treatment ( physiological saline ) . Output : the negative RT-PCR date will be compared in the two groups . Variables : we will study the socio-demographic characteristics ( age , sex , level of study ) and the recovery dates ( dates of confirmation samples , disappearance of symptoms and control ) the presence of hospitalization . Sample size : for a gain of 07 days for healing , with 90 % power and a 2-sided 0.05 significance level , 130 patients were required ( 65 in each group ) . C.

University of Oklahoma,NCT04730193,Caffeine and Cerebrovascular Reactivity,University of Oklahoma,0,1,Caffeine,Drug,Caffeine,Other,Triple,"Caffeine is the most commonly used stimulant drug with well documented effects on cerebral vascula-ture . Caffeine is known to non-specifically bind to adenosine receptors in the brain and to reduce resting blood flow while improving attention and cognitive function , which suggests that it may allow a more efficient dynamic blood flow regulation through neurovascular coupling . This study will use standardized dose of caffeine to test its effect on NVC responses in cerebral and retinal arterioles .","Normal brain function is critically dependent on moment-to-moment adjustment of cerebral blood flow to match demands of activated neurons . This process is known as neurovascular coupling ( NVC ) and recent in vivo studies demonstrate that impairment of NVC responses is associated with worse cognitive performance . Several methods are available to measure NVC responses in human subjects , including transcranial Doppler ( TCD ) , functional near infrared spectroscopy ( fNIRS ) , and dynamic retinal vessel analysis ( DVA ) . Although all these methodologies aim to measure hemodynamic changes in the brain vasculature in response to cognitive , motor , or visual stimulation , the responses are evaluated on the different levels of cerebral vasculature including microvasculature ( fNIRS ) , large cerebral vessels such as middle cerebral artery ( TCD ) , or in the arterioles and venules of the retina ( DVA ) . Currently , there are limited data available on the simultaneous assessment of NVC responses using these methodologies .

It is the main cause of morbidity and mortality among children . The management of malaria cases is based on the principle of early diagnosis and rapid treatment with effective drugs . It is confronted with the appearance of strains resistant to antimalarial drugs , hence the need to monitor antimalarial drug sensitivity . The study was conducted in three regions representing epidemiological strata of the country : Agadez ( Centre de santé Intégré of Dagamanet in the Health district of Agadez ) , Maradi ( Centre de santé intégré of Guindaoua in Tessaoua ) and Dosso ( Centre de santé Intégré centre in Gaya ) . The protocol used is the WHO standardized protocol of 2009 . Artemether/Lumefantrine ( AL ) was administered with a 28-day follow-up in children aged 3 months to 15 years . A Polymerase Chain Reaction ( PCR ) correction is planned to differentiate between treatment failure and re-infestation as well as a study of genes responsible for resistance on the main drugs used .","The study took place from September 1 to October 31 , 2020 at the time of peak malaria transmission .

These sites were identified by the NMCP because of their high attendance rate and belong to 3 different malaria epidemiological strata . As the treatment failure rate of artemether lumefantrine ( AL ) in the regions is unknown , 5 % was chosen . With a confidence level of 95 % and a precision around the estimate of 5 % , a minimum of 73 patients were included . The number of patients was increased by 20 % to account for possible dropouts and withdrawals during the 28/42 day follow-up period , 88 patients were included in the study per site .

The current strategy to control STH in endemic areas is mass administration of albendazole or mebendazole , mainly to pre-school and school-aged children . Although this treatment works well for some STH species , efficacy against Trichuris trichiura is poor and it is not effective Strongyloides stercoralis . Thus new drugs or drug combinations are an urgent priority to increase the effectiveness of control programmes . Furthermore , the World Health Organisation has recommended combination therapy of ivermectin with albendazole . The trial proposed , is an adaptive phase II/III trial where the phase II component will evaluate the safety of the FDC as a single dose or 3-day single dose regimen for the treatment of T. trichiura in paediatric population . After analysis of the safety results the phase III trial will be executed to evaluate the efficacy of the FDC as a single dose or 3-day single dose regimen compared to the standard single dose regimen of ALB ( 400 mg ) for the treatment of T. trichiura , hookworm and S. stercoralis in paediatric and young adult population . The estimated total sample size for the adaptive design ( phase II and III component ) is 1223 participants . Of these , 126 will be enrolled in the phase II and 1097 in the phase III components respectively in an adaptive trial design .","An adaptive phase II/III clinical trial to evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of a Single Day or 3-day Single Dose of an ALBENDAZOLE-IVERMECTIN Coformulation vs ALBENDAZOLE for the Treatment of Soil-Transmitted Helminth Infections .

Phase II component ( Kenya only ) Unicentric , 3-arm , parallel , open-label , individually randomised , phase II trial to determine in three weight groups , the safety of the ALBENDAZOLEIVERMECTIN Co-formulation given as a Single Day or 3-day Single Dose regimen for the treatment of Trichuris trichiura in children and young adult aged between 5 to 18 years . Estimated sample size : 126 participants Participants will be stratified in three different weight groups in order to gradually increase the dose of ivermectin in the Fixed Dose Co-formulation ( FDC ) : Group 1 ( 38 participants ) : with body weight of 23- < 30 Kg will receive 300-391 µg/Kg IVM ( FDC 400mg-9mg ) or ALB Group 2 ( 38 participants ) : with body weight of 30-45 Kg will receive 400-600 µg/Kg IVM ( FDC 400mg-18mg ) or ALB . Group 3 ( 50 participants ) : with body weight of 15-23 Kg will receive 391-600 µg/Kg IVM ( FDC 400mg-9mg ) or ALB . Where FDC stands for Fixed Dose Co-formulation and ALB stands for Albendazole . Then , the participants will be allocated to one of the three study arms with unequal probability ( ALB : p=0.2 , n=26 ; FDCx1 : p=0.4 , n=50 ; FDCx3 : p=0.4 , n=50 ) starting with group 1 .

Phase III Component A multi-centre , 3-arm , parallel , open-label , randomised , phase III trial to compare safety and efficacy of the active control arm ( current standard of care ) against 2 experimental arms for the treatment of T. trichiura , hookworm and S. stercoralis , in children and young adult aged between 5-18 years in three subSaharan African countries ( Ethiopia , Kenya and Mozambique ) We hypothesise that the FDC of Ivermectin ( IVM ) and ALB either at single or 3- day regimens will be more effective against some species of Soil Transmitted Helminths ( STH ) ( T. trichiura , hookworm and S. stercoralis ) compared to the current use of a single dose regimen of 400mg ALB . Estimated sample size : 1097 participants Participants will be randomly allocated with unequal probability , according to the specific expected cure rate by treatment and specie , to one of the three study treatment arms . Treatment Arm 1 : Single dose of a tablet of ALB 400 mg ( active control arm ) . Treatment Arm 2 : Single dose of a tablet of FDC 400mg-18mg or 400mg-9mg . For participants < 45 kg of body weight at baseline : FDC of 400mg ALB- 9mg IVM . For participants ≥45 kg of body weight at baseline : FDC of 400mg ALB-18mg IVM .

Institut Universitari Dexeus,NCT04992468,Dual Trigger for Elective Fertility Preservation,Fundación Santiago Dexeus Font,4,1,Infertility,Drug,Ovulation triggering with GnRH-a+rhCG,Treatment,,"The widespread availability of efficient contraception as well as women 's increased education has led to childbearing postponement . Combined with the increased recognition of the concept of `` ovarian aging '' , this has opened the Pandora´s box of EOC , which is currently considered a safe and cost-efficient approach among assisted reproduction techniques . Previous studies have shown that two main factors determine the CLBR after EOC : 1 ) patient 's age at the time of oocyte banking , and 2 ) the number of oocytes retrieved . Therefore , measures aiming at increasing the oocyte yield , specially the number of mature oocytes retrieved , will maximize the success of this technique . In the last few years , the dual trigger for final oocyte maturation has emerged has an approach that seems to improve both oocyte yield and quality when compared to the hCG trigger alone . Nowadays , the standard of care in EOC patients is final oocyte maturation with a single bolus of GnRH-a . Understanding the impact of the dual trigger on the number of MII oocytes retrieved in patients undergoing EOC will improve the treatment protocols and allow for a better patient counselling .","Elective oocyte cryopreservation ( EOC ) has been gaining increasing importance in the last few years , driven by the widespread information regarding the concept of 'age-related fertility decline ' , as well as the availability of efficient contraception and women 's increasing educational and professional aspirations . Considering the similar clinical outcomes regarding live birth rate after vitrified-warmed and fresh oocytes and the proven cost-effectiveness of this approach , oocyte banking is now considered an efficient technique in assisted reproduction . Previous studies have shown that both patient 's age and the number of oocytes retrieved have a significant impact on the cumulative live birth rate ( CLBR ) in patients undergoing EOC , highlighting the importance of maximizing oocyte yield in these patients . In all these former reports , final follicular maturation was triggered by one bolus of human chorionic gonadotropin ( hCG ) or , following recent trends in clinical practice , by a single bolus of Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone agonist ( GnRH-a ) . More recently , the concomitant administration of both GnRH-a and a bolus of HCG prior to oocyte retrieval ( dual trigger ) has been proposed as a new strategy for final follicular maturation , aiming to improve oocyte and embryo quality . When compared to HCG trigger , the dual trigger adds the more physiologic follicular stimulating hormone ( FSH ) and luteinizing hormone ( LH ) peak provided by GnRH-a . With this approach , several studies have reported an increase in the number of MII oocytes retrieved , as well as in the number of good quality embryos and improved pregnancy outcomes in different subpopulations of infertile patients . Nowadays , the standard of care in patients undergoing a freeze-all approach , either for oocyte or embryo cryopreservation , is final follicular maturation with GnRH-a due to its more physiologic and shorter surge of both LH and FSH , terminating 24h after its onset , and reducing the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ( OHSS ) . So far , no study has compared the dual trigger approach to the use of a single bolus of GnRH-a . By adding HCG activity and , therefore , generating higher intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate ( cAMP ) accumulation , an amplification of the steroidogenic response of the pre-ovulatory follicle might be achieved with the dual trigger when compared to the GnRH-a trigger alone . Therefore , the investigators set out to perform this randomized controlled trial aiming to compare , for the first time , the dual trigger and the GnRH-a trigger regarding the number of MII oocytes retrieved in patients undergoing EOC .",2021-07-05,"July 24, 2023","Inclusion Criteria : Able and willing to sign the Patient Consent Form and adhere to study visitation schedule antral follicle count ( AFC ) =18 and ≤40 years BMI > 18 and < 30 kg/m2 Exclusion Criteria : Medically indicated fertility preservation AFC ≥ 20 Polycystic ovarian syndrome ( PCOS ) according to the Rotterdam criteria FSH ≥ 20 History of untreated autoimmune , endocrine or metabolic disorders Contraindication for hormonal treatment Recent history of severe disease requiring regular treatment ( clinically significant concurrent medical condition that could compromise subject safety or interfered with the trial assessment ) .",136,1,18 Years,40 Years

Ukrainian Medical Stomatological Academy,NCT05042024,Supplementation With L-ornithine But Not L-arginine Increases Density of CD68+ and CD163+ Macrophages in Periodontitis,Ukrainian Medical Stomatological Academy,3,1,Periodontitis,Procedure,Scaling and root planing,Treatment,,"The aim of the study was to investigate whether oral administration of L-arginine or L-ornithine could modulate local representation density and ratio of macrophages in periodontitis-affected gingiva by using immunohistochemical detection of CD68+ and CD163+ macrophages in biopsies of the gingiva . The null hypothesis tested was that L-arginine and L-ornithine have no influences on CD68+ and CD163+ macrophages densities when supplementing the treatment of periodontitis . Materials and methods . 75 individuals with a diagnosis of generalized periodontitis at stages II-III and grade B ( 38 women and 37 men , 51 % and 49 % , respectively ) were included in the study . Periodontitis was diagnosed by using the criteria of the Classification of Periodontal and Peri-Implant Diseases and Conditions 2017 . 25 patients received scaling and root planing only ; 25 patients additionally received L-arginine , and 25 - L-ornithine , according to instructions available in Ukraine . For the immunohistochemical study of paraffin-embedded sections , the gingival biopsy was taken from 5 selected patients per group before treatment and after 1 month . CD68+ ( cluster of differentiation 68 positive ) and CD163+ cells served as a morphological equivalent of M1 , M2 macrophages subpopulations , and their densities were calculated per 10000 μm2 . Statistical analysis was performed by adequate power methods .","Study design The present work was the original research study . 75 individuals with a diagnosis of generalized periodontitis at stages II-III and grade B ( 38 women and 37 men , 51 % and 49 % , respectively ) were included in the study . Periodontitis was diagnosed by using the criteria of the Classification of Periodontal and Peri-Implant Diseases and Conditions 2017 . Stage II of periodontitis was diagnosed in the presence of 3 to 4 mm interdental CAL at the site of greatest loss , 4 to maximum 5 mm PPD , the radiographic bone loss at the root coronal third , and no tooth loss due to periodontitis . Stage III was diagnosed in the presence of ≥5 mm interdental CAL , the radiographic bone loss extending to the middle or apical third of the root , ≤4 teeth loss due to periodontitis . In all cases , periodontitis had a generalized pattern ( > 30 % of teeth involved ) and grade B as patterns of the progression , based on indirect evidence ( radiographic bone loss expressed as a percentage of root length divided by the age of the subject was from 0.25 to 1.0 ) . Patients were grouped by stratified randomization into three groups : the SRP Group ( patients received scaling and root planing as a full-mouth procedure , n=25 ) ; the Arg Group ( patients received oral L-arginine aspartate ( Yuria-Pharm , Ukraine ) at a dose of 1 g t.i.d . for 10 days after SRP , n=25 ) ; and the Orn Group ( patients received oral L-ornithine aspartate ( Farmak , Ukraine ) at a dose of 3 g t.i.d . for 15 days after SRP , n=25 ) . We used arginine and ornithine according to instructions for these medicines available for use in Ukraine . During the study , all patients were on a stable diet , without changing their rations and regiments . For all participants , gender and age were recorded , and periodontal parameters such as periodontal pocket depth ( PPD ) , clinical attachment level ( CAL ) and bleeding on probing ( BoP ) measurements were taken from six periodontal sites on all teeth ( except for the third molars ) by a single calibrated examiner using a manual periodontal probe ( dental explorer tool labeled 0106.DT06.CP10 , Den Tag , Italy ) . PPD and CAL were measured to the nearest 1 mm . All patients were clinically examined before treatment and after 1 month ± 5 days . Collection of gingival tissue samples For the precise immunohistochemical study , the gingival biopsy of approximately 3x3 mm was excised under local anesthesia before treatment and 1 month later in 5 selected patients per group . Biopsies were obtained in the same time-points , from a single site displaying the deepest pocket around suitable dental and periodontal procedures . Removal of these tissue biopsies did not interfere with the initial treatment plan or influence upon the expected clinical outcomes . After collection , biopsies were fixed in a 4 % formalin solution for 24 hr of fixation , dehydrated , and embedded in paraffin . Immunohistochemistry and antibodies Paraffin sections , 2-3 μm in thickness were deparaffinized and dehydrated . Heat-induced epitope retrieval in citrate buffer , power of hydrogen ( pH ) 6 , was performed by successive heating the slides in the microwave oven , then allowed to cool , rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) , incubated with blocked reagent , rinsed , and incubated with mouse monoclonal CD68 antibodies ( 1:30 , clone PG-M1 , Diagnostic BioSystems , The Hague , The Netherlands ) or anti-CD163 ( 1:100 , clone 10D6 , Diagnostic BioSystems , The Hague , The Netherlands ) . Then sections were stained with the 2-steps Mouse/Rabbit PolyVue Plus™ HRP/DAB Detection System ( Diagnostic BioSystems , The Hague , The Netherlands ) , and counterstained with Mayer 's haemalaun . PBS was used as a negative control , the lymph node tissue - as a positive control . Evaluation of immunohistochemical staining CD68+ and CD163+ macrophages ( Mφs ) were estimated by counting the number of the cells by light microscope ×400 in intensive infiltrative areas , 5 regions from each slice were selected , and all 5 counts were taken for statistics . We counted immunopositive Mφs in the areas of cell infiltration , since they are directly related to inflammation . The number of cells per 10 000 μm2 was calculated as immunopositive cell density . Photos were obtained using the light microscope Axio Lab.A1 ( Carl Zeiss , Göttingen , Germany ) ( ×400 ) . Statistical analysis Small sample size was justified by the expectation of a high effect size , unknown null distribution , and compensated with adequate power non parametric statistics . Precise sample size calculation was not performed . Means of PPD and CAL were calculated for sites with PD > 4mm ( affected sites ) . Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 5 software ( GraphPad Software , San Diego , USA ) by means of descriptive statistics , chi-square test , one-way ANOVA and nonparametric ANOVA tests for multiple comparisons : Friedman - for dependent variables , Kruskal-Wallis test - for independent variables , with post-hoc analyzing . For descriptive statistics of cells numbers , the percentile ranges were also used because of non-normal distributions . The CD68+/CD163+ ratio was assessed by inter-group t-tests comparisons and Spearman correlation checking . P values of < 0.05 were considered statistically significant in all of the analyses .",2021-08-31,"September 11, 2021","Inclusion Criteria : Presence of periodontitis Good general health At least 19 remaining teeth Written informed consent forms Exclusion Criteria : Antibiotics or anti-inflammatory medications use within the preceding 3 months Periodontal therapy within the previous 6 months Purulent exudation from periodontal pockets Pregnancy and breastfeeding Presence of severe , uncontrolled ( decompensated ) diseases of the internal organs , or neuropsychiatric disorders Presence of other conditions that determined the inability of the patient to understand the nature and possible consequences of the study",75,0,25 Years,54 Years

Subjects will be admitted into the study site on Day -1 and be confined to the study site until at least Day 8 . On the morning of Day 1 , all subjects will receive a single oral dose of [ 14C ] -SKI-O-703 . Subjects will be discharged if the following discharge criteria are met : plasma radioactivity levels below the limit of quantitation for 2 consecutive collections , ≥ 90 % mass balance recovery , and ≤ 1 % of the total radioactive dose is recovered in combined excreta ( urine and feces ) in 2 consecutive 24-hour periods .

SKI-O-592 ( the free base of SKI-O-703 ) has demonstrated high selectivity and potency against spleen tyrosine kinase in a biochemical assay . For immunoreceptor activation linked to SYK , the effect of SKI-O-592 on the anti-inflammatory response consisting of tumor necrosis factor alpha , β-hexosaminidase , and CD69 expression was greater than the effects of first-generation SYK inhibitors ( eg , R406 ) in several immune cell lines and in human primary cells . This anti-inflammatory activity was responsible for the selective inhibition of p-SYK ( Y525/526 ) , which led to the sequential inhibition of downstream effectors . In vitro studies revealed excellent SYK selectivity of SKI-O-592 that led to no inhibition of SYK-independent signal pathways , indicating that SKI-O-592 shows more potent anti-inflammatory activity to allow continuous administration of SKI-O-703 compared with the first-generation SYK inhibitors .

Kasr El Aini Hospital,NCT05051150,Epinephrine Infusion for Prophylaxis Against Maternal Hypotension During Caesarean Section,Kasr El Aini Hospital,4,0,Post-spinal Hypotension,Drug,Epinephrin 0.03,Prevention,Quadruple,"Maternal hypotension after spinal block is a common complication after subarachnoid block in this population . The incidence of maternal hypotension is nearly 60 % when prophylactic vasopressors are not used . Therefore , it is highly recommended to use vasopressors , preferably as continuous infusion , for prophylaxis rather than delaying their use until hypotension occurs . Phenylephrine ( PE ) is the recommended drug for prophylaxis against hypotension during cesarean delivery ; however , the use of PE is commonly associated with decreased heart rate and probably cardiac output because PE is a pure alpha adrenoreceptor agonist . Introduction of NE in obstetric practice had shown favorable maternal and neonatal outcomes and was associated with higher heart rate and cardiac output compared to PE . However , there is still some mothers who develop bradycardia and diminished cardiac output with the use of NE . The most desired scenario during hemodynamic management of mothers during cesarean delivery would achieve the least possible incidences of maternal hypotension , bradycardia and reactive hypertension . Therefore , it is warranted to reach a vasopressor regimen with the most stable hemodynamic profile . In the last year , epinephrine was reported for the first time in obstetric practice with acceptable safety on the mother and the fetus . However , there is still lack of data about the most appropriate dose for infusion during cesarean delivery . In this study , we aim to compare three prophylactic infusion rates for epinephrine during cesarean delivery .","Upon arrival to the operating room , the patient will be in supine position with left uterine displacement using a wedge below the right buttock . Routine monitoring will be applied ( electrocardiography , pulse oximetry , and non-invasive blood pressure monitor ) . An 18G-cannula will be inserted , and the patients will receive 10 mg metoclopramide , and 50 mg ranitidine . Baseline heart rate and systolic blood pressure will be recorded as the average of three consecutive readings with 2-minutes interval . Lactated Ringer 's solution will be infused at rate of 15 mL/Kg over 10 minutes as a co-load ; spinal anesthesia will be achieved by injecting 10 mg of hyperbaric bupivacaine and 20 mcg fentanyl into the subarachnoid space at L3-L4 or L4-L5 interspace using 25G spinal needle . After subarachnoid block , mothers will be placed in supine position with left-lateral tilt and the vasopressor infusion will be started . To maintain the double-blind scheme , the total dosage of epinephrine ( mcg ) for patients in each group will be calculated and added to the 50 ml syringe and will be infused at rate of 50 mL/hour . The calculated epinephrine dose will be withdrawn using insulin syringe . The vasopressor infusion will be through the same line as the intravenous fluids using a three-way stopcock . the infusion will be stopped when there is tachycardia ( > 130 % of baseline value ) and/or reactive hypertension ( systolic blood pressure > 120 % of baseline ) , otherwise the infusion will be stopped 5-mins after the baby delivery . Block success will be assessed after 5 minutes from intrathecal injection of local anesthetic ; and will be confirmed if sensory block level is at T4 . Post-spinal hypotension ( defined as systolic blood pressure ≤80 % of the baseline reading during the period from intrathecal injection to delivery of the fetus ) will be managed by administration of 9 mg of ephedrine Severe post-spinal hypotension ( defined as systolic blood pressure ≤60 % of the baseline reading ) will be managed by administration IV ephedrine 15 mg. Reactive hypertension ( defined as systolic blood pressure ≥120 % from the baseline reading ) will be managed by stoppage of the infusion till the next systolic blood pressure reading . The infusion will be then re-started at the half of the initial rate , when systolic blood pressure decreases to be within 20 % of the baseline reading . Intraoperative bradycardia ( defined as heart rate less than 55 bpm ) will be managed by IV atropine bolus ( 0.5 mg ) will be administered .

University of Michigan,NCT05057221,"Safety, Tolerability and Efficacy of Uproleselan (GMI-1271) in Patients With COVID-19 Pneumonia","Lena Napolitano, MD",1,0,COVID-19 Pneumonia,Drug,Uproleselan,Treatment,,The purpose of this study is to find out whether the drug uproleselan can help patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia . Investigators will study both the side effects of the drug and assess if the drug will help patients recover more quickly and slow down the progression of acute respiratory failure .,"Soluble E-selectin is a significant biomarker for adult respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) . Soluble E-selectin also has pro-inflammatory properties further releasing cytokines and promoting its synthesis and the continued influx of neutrophils . Small molecule glycomimetic antagonists of E-selectin ( rivipansel and uproleselan ) are 500- to 1000-fold more potent inhibitors of E-selectin and have shown activity and no measurable toxicity in human clinical trials for other indications . Treatment with these E-selectin inhibitors reduced the levels of soluble E-selectin in the bloodstream which occurs during recovery of ARDS . Thus , antagonists of E-selectin which include glycomimetic antagonists and more specifically , rivipansel ( GMI-1070 ) and uproleselan ( GMI-1271 ) , may be used to treat COVID-19 patients with respiratory symptoms that may lead to ARDS Primary Objective : Safety of uproleselan in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia . Secondary Objectives : To evaluate if treatment with uproleselan administered intravenously in addition to the best available therapy according to institutional guidelines is able to reduce the progression of acute respiratory failure , in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia . To evaluate proportion of patients alive and free of respiratory failure through Day 28 To evaluate overall survival and all-cause mortality at day 15 and 28 . To evaluate changes in the COVID ordinal outcomes scale . To assess adverse events to evaluate the safety of uproleselan . To assess ventilator-free days , ICU-free days , oxygen , vasopressor free days . To evaluate changes in D-dimer . Exploratory Objectives : To examine the correlation of plasma soluble E-selectin concentrations with clinical outcomes . To examine the correlations of other biomarkers of interest with clinical outcome . Previous versions of this record mistakenly suggested the trial would assess the number of participants who experienced a Grade 3-5 hemorrhagic event . The outcome title has been corrected to state the number of participants with a Grade 3-4 hemorrhagic event were assessed , as the scale used does not go to Grade 5 .",2021-09-23,"June 16, 2023","Inclusion Criteria : Documented COVID-19 pneumonia : defined as upper respiratory tract specimen ( nasopharyngeal swab ( NPS ) or viral throat swab ) positive for COVID-19 and/or imaging at computed tomography scan suggestive of COVID-19 pneumonia .

AnestesiaR,NCT05110469,Comparison of MgSO4 Versus Meperidine for Prevention of Shivering During Spinal Anesthesia,AnestesiaR,4,1,Shivering,Drug,Magnesium sulfate,Prevention,Quadruple,"This was a double-blind randomized interventional study of 100 patients divided into two groups . Group M received MgSO4 30 mg/kg , and group P received meperidine 0.5 mg/kg intravenously in 100 ml of 0.9 % NaCl before undergoing spinal anesthesia . Participants were non-pregnant patients between 18-65 years of age , belonging to the American Society of Anesthesiologist physical status I or II . Shivering was regarded as significant if it occurred at grade 3 or 4 . Data of patient characteristics , shivering degree , tympanic membrane temperature , vital sign , and side effects were recorded .","Study Design This was double-blinded randomized clinical trial that was conducted in Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo National General Hospital in February - June 2021 after due permission from Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Medicine University of Indonesia - Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital ( No . KET-1510/UN2.F1/ETIK/PPM.00.02/2020 ) . Patients were randomly devided into two groups to recieved MgSO4 30 mg/kg ( group M ) and meperidine 0.5 mg/kg ( group P ) . Drugs will be prepared and delivered by another anesthesiologist outside of the research team . Subjects Following patient informed consent , 100 patients aged 18-65 years old , with American Society of Anesthesiologist ( ASA ) physical status I or II who underwent spinal anesthesia . The following groups of patients were excluded from the study : patients with a history of allergy to the drugs used in the study , pregnant patients , neuromuscular disease , hyperthyroid , severe cardiopulmonary diseases , liver and/or renal disorders , used drugs that could interact with MgSO4 such as nifedipine , and preoperative body temperature less than 36oC or more than 37.5oC . Patients were dropped out if : any complications such as systemic allergic reaction , anaphylaxis , cardiac arrest was occured , failure of spinal anesthesia , respinal , surgery duration less than 30 minutes , and conversion to general anesthesia during evaluation . Interventions and Outcomes After randomization , subjects would be given drugs according to their randomization group . MgSO4 30 mg/kg and meperidine 0.5 mg/kg were dissolved in 100 ml NaCl 0.9 % , and labeled as `` research drug '' for blinding . Drugs were given in 10 minutes while patients were monitored for side effects such as hypotension , bradycardia , nausea , vomiting , itch , allergy , drowsiness , and respiratory depression . If hypotension occurs or blood pressure decreases > 20 % from baseline , patients will be treated with a crystalloid solution and intravenous ephedrine 5-10 mg . Afterwards , patients were given 10 ml/kg crystalloid with room temperature 22oC - 23oC for 10 minutes before spinal anesthesia . Spinal anesthesia was performed at the lumbar vertebrae 3-4 or 4-5 interspaces , with 15 mg hyperbaric bupivacaine and fentanyl 25 mcg . Room temperature was maintained between 19oC - 24oC . Patients were covered with one layer of blanket , which covered the chest and upper arm , and other areas outside the operating area . Patients were given fluid maintenance of 2 ml/kg/hour crystalloid and oxygen supplementation 2-3 l/minute by nasal cannula . Patient ini this study also were managed in the state of Ramsay sedation scale 2 ( co-operative , oriented , and tranquil ) or 3 ( appears asleep , but responds to verbal command ) , so some patient were given midazolam intravenously to maintain the condition . The incidence of shivering , mean arterial pressure , heart rate , respiratory rate , and tympanic membrane temperature were observed every five minutes during the first 15 minutes and every 15 minutes within the next 120 minutes . The degree of shivering was measured with Crossley and Mahajan scale which is 0 = No shivering , 1 = piloerection or peripheral vasoconstriction , 2 = muscular activity in only 1 muscle group , 3 = muscular activity in more than 1 muscle group but not generalized , and 4 = intens shivering involving the whole body , except in the muscle affected by spinal block.6 Drugs were considered effective if they could prevent the incidence of 3rd or 4th degree shivering . Meperidine 25 mg intravenously was given if 3rd or 4th degree shivering occurred . Nausea and vomiting was treated by IV metoclopramide 10 mg. Postoperatively , all patients were transferred to recovery room and monitored for one hour until discharge . Statistical Analysis All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS ( Statistical Package for Social Sciences ) version 20.0 . Chi-square test or Fisher 's exact test were used to compare the difference of proportion in shivering between the two groups . For numerical data , T-test and Mann-Whitney test were used . P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant .",2021-10-14,"October 26, 2021","Inclusion Criteria : Aged 18-65 years old American Society of Anesthesiologist ( ASA ) physical status I or II Planning for spinal anesthesia Exclusion Criteria : History of allergy to the drugs used in the study Pregnant patients With neuromuscular disease , hyperthyroid , severe cardiopulmonary diseases , liver and/or renal disorders Used drugs that could interact with MgSO4 such as nifedipine Preoperative body temperature less than 36oC or more than 37.5oC",100,0,18 Years,65 Years
